b'         when the Pharisees with some scribe who have come from Jerusalem gather around Jesus , they observe that some of his disciple eat their meal with unclean , that is , unwashed , hand . for the Pharisees and , in fact , all Jews , do not eat without carefully wash their hand , keep the tradition of the elder . and on come from the marketplace they do not eat without purify themselves . and there be many other thing that they have traditionally observe , the purification of cup and jug and kettle and bed .   so the Pharisees and scribe question he , " why do your disciple not follow the tradition of the elder but instead eat a meal with unclean hand ? " he respond , " well do Isaiah prophesy about you hypocrite , as it be write : this people honor I with their lip , but their heart be far from I ; in vain do they worship I , teach as doctrine human precept . you disregard God \'s commandment but cle to human tradition . " he summon the crowd again and say to they , " hear I , all of you , and understand . nothing that enter one from outside can defile that person ; but the thing that come out from within be what defile . " from within people , from their heart , come evil thought , unchastity , theft , murder , adultery , greed , malice , deceit , licentiousness , envy , blasphemy , arrogance , folly . all these evil come from within and they defile .
