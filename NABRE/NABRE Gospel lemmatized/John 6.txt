b '   Multiplication of the Loaves .       after this , Jesus go across the Sea of Galilee [ of Tiberias ] .        a large crowd follow he , because they see the sign he be perform on the sick .      Jesus go up on the mountain , and there he sit down with his disciple .      the jewish feast of Passover be near .         when Jesus raise his eye and see that a large crowd be come to he , he say to Philip ,    where can we buy enough food for they to eat ?       he say this to test he , because he himself know what he be go to do .      Philip answer he , two hundred day wage    worth of food would not be enough for each of they to have a little [ bit ] .        one of his disciple , Andrew , the brother of Simon Peter , say to he ,      there be a boy here who have five barley loaf    and two fish ; but what good be these for so many ?        Jesus say , have the people recline . now there be a great deal of grass    in that place . so the man recline , about five thousand in number .        then Jesus take the loaf , give thank , and distribute they to those who be recline , and also as much of the fish as they want .        when they have have their fill , he say to his disciple , gather the fragment leave over , so that nothing will be waste .      so they collect they , and fill twelve wicker basket    with fragment from the five barley loaf that have be more than they could eat .      when the people see the sign he have do , they say , this be truly the Prophet ,    the one who be to come into the world .        since Jesus know that they be go to come and carry he off to make he king , he withdraw again to the mountain alone .   walk on the Water .         when it be evening , his disciple go down to the sea ,      embark in a boat , and go across the sea to Capernaum . it have already grow dark , and Jesus have not yet come to they .      the sea be stir up because a strong wind be blow .      when they have row about three or four mile , they see Jesus walk on the sea    and come near the boat , and they begin to be afraid .        but he say to they , it be I.    do not be afraid .      they want to take he into the boat , but the boat immediately arrive at the shore to which they be head .    the Bread of Life Discourse .      the next day , the crowd that remain across the sea see that there have be only one boat there , and that Jesus have not go along with his disciple in the boat , but only his disciple have leave .       other boat come from Tiberias near the place where they have eat the bread when the Lord give thank .      when the crowd see that neither Jesus nor his disciple be there , they themselves get into boat and come to Capernaum look for Jesus .      and when they find he across the sea they say to he , Rabbi , when do you get here ?      Jesus answer they and say , amen , amen , I say to you , you be look for I not because you see sign but because you eat the loaf and be fill .      do not work for food that perish but for the food that endure for eternal life ,    which the Son of Man will give you . for on he the Father , God , have set his seal .        so they say to he , what can we do to accomplish the work of God ?      Jesus answer and say to they , this be the work of God , that you believe in the one he send .      so they say to he , what sign can you do , that we may see and believe in you ? what can you do ?         our ancestor eat manna in the desert , as it be write :   he give they bread from heaven to eat .     so Jesus say to they , amen , amen , I say to you , it be not Moses who give the bread from heaven ; my Father give you the true bread from heaven .        for the bread of God be that which come down from heaven and give life to the world .      so they say to he , Sir , give we this bread always .       Jesus say to they , I be the bread of life ; whoever come to I will never hunger , and whoever believe in I will never thirst .        but I tell you that although you have see [ I ] , you do not believe .        everything that the Father give I will come to I , and I will not reject anyone who come to I ,      because I come down from heaven not to do my own will but the will of the one who send I .        and this be the will of the one who send I , that I should not lose anything of what he give I , but that I should raise it [ on ] the last day .        for this be the will of my Father , that everyone who see the Son and believe in he may have eternal life , and I shall raise he [ on ] the last day .      the Jews murmur about he because he say , I be the bread that come down from heaven ,      and they say , be this not Jesus , the son of Joseph ? do we not know his father and mother ? then how can he say , I have come down from heaven ?        Jesus answer and say to they , stop murmur    among yourself .        no one can come to I unless the Father who send I draw he , and I will raise he on the last day .      it be write in the prophet : they shall all be teach by God . everyone who listen to my Father and learn from he come to I .        not that anyone have see the Father except the one who be from God ; he have see the Father .        amen , amen , I say to you , whoever believe have eternal life .      I be the bread of life .      your ancestor eat the manna in the desert , but they die ;        this be the bread that come down from heaven so that one may eat it and not die .      I be the live bread that come down from heaven ; whoever eat this bread will live forever ; and the bread that I will give be my flesh for the life of the world .      the Jews quarrel among themselves , say , how can this man give we [ his ] flesh to eat ?      Jesus say to they , amen , amen , I say to you , unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood , you do not have life within you .      whoever eat    my flesh and drink my blood have eternal life , and I will raise he on the last day .      for my flesh be true food , and my blood be true drink .      whoever eat my flesh and drink my blood remain in I and I in he .      just as the live Father send I and I have life because of the Father , so also the one who feed on I will have life because of I .        this be the bread that come down from heaven . unlike your ancestor who eat and still die , whoever eat this bread will live forever .      these thing he say while teach in the synagogue in Capernaum . the word of Eternal Life .        then many of his disciple who be listen say , this saying be hard ; who can accept it ?      since Jesus know that his disciple be murmur about this , he say to they , do this shock you ?      what if you be to see the Son of Man ascend to where he be before ?        it be the spirit that give life , while the flesh    be of no avail . the word I have speak to you be spirit and life .      but there be some of you who do not believe . Jesus know from the beginning the one who would not believe and the one who would betray he .        and he say , for this reason I have tell you that no one can come to I unless it be grant he by my Father .     as a result of this , many [ of ] his disciple return to their former way of life and no long accompany he .      Jesus then say to the twelve , do you also want to leave ?      Simon Peter answer he , Master , to whom shall we go ? you have the word of eternal life .      we have come to believe and be convinced that you be the Holy One of God .        Jesus answer they , do I not choose you twelve ? yet be not one of you a devil ?      he be refer to Judas , son of Simon the Iscariot ; it be he who would betray he , one of the Twelve .
