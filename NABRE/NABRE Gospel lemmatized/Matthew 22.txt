b '   the parable of the Wedding Feast .       Jesus again in reply speak to they in parable , say ,      the kingdom of heaven may be liken to a king who give a wedding feast    for his son .       he dispatch his servant to summon the invite guest to the feast , but they refuse to come .      a second time he send other servant , say , tell those invite : behold , I have prepare my banquet , my calf and fatten cattle be kill , and everything be ready ; come to the feast .      some ignore the invitation and go away , one to his farm , another to his business .       the rest lay hold of his servant , mistreat they , and kill they .       the king be enrage and send his troop , destroy those murderer , and burn their city .      then he say to his servant , the feast be ready , but those who be invite be not worthy to come .      go out , therefore , into the main road and invite to the feast whomever you find .      the servant go out into the street and gather all they find , bad and good alike ,    and the hall be fill with guest .       but when the king come in to meet the guest he see a man there not dress in a wedding garment .      he say to he , my friend , how be it that you come in here without a wedding garment ? but he be reduce to silence .        then the king say to his attendant , bind his hand and foot , and cast he into the darkness outside , where there will be wail and grinding of tooth .      many be invite , but few be choose . pay taxis to the Emperor .         then the Pharisees    go off and plot how they might entrap he in speech .      they send their disciple to he , with the Herodians ,    say , teacher , we know that you be a truthful man and that you teach the way of God in accordance with the truth . and you be not concern with anyone opinion , for you do not regard a person status .       tell we , then , what be your opinion : be it lawful to pay the census tax to Caesar or not ?      know their malice , Jesus say , why be you test I , you hypocrite ?       show I the coin that pay the census tax . then they hand he the roman coin .      he say to they , whose image be this and whose inscription ?       they reply , Caesars .    at that he say to they , then repay to Caesar what belong to Caesar and to God what belong to God .      when they hear this they be amazed , and leave he they go away . the question about the resurrection .         on that day Sadducees approach he , say that there be no resurrection .    they put this question to he ,       say , Teacher , Moses say , if a man die    without child , his brother shall marry his wife and raise up descendant for his brother .      now there be seven brother among we . the first marry and die and , have no descendant , leave his wife to his brother .      the same happen with the second and the third , through all seven .      finally the woman die .      now at the resurrection , of the seven , whose wife will she be ? for they all have be marry to she .       Jesus say to they in reply , you be mislead because you do not know the scripture or the power of God .      at the resurrection they neither marry nor be give in marriage but be like the angel in heaven .      and concern the resurrection of the dead , have you not read what be say to you    by God ,       I be the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob ? he be not the God of the dead but of the living .      when the crowd hear this , they be astonish at his teaching . the Greatest Commandment .         when the Pharisees hear that he have silence the Sadducees , they gather together ,      and one of they [ a scholar of the law ]    test he by ask ,      teacher ,    which commandment in the law be the great ?       he say to he ,    you shall love the Lord , your God , with all your heart , with all your soul , and with all your mind .      this be the great and the first commandment .       the second be like it :    you shall love your neighbor as yourself .        the whole law and the prophet depend on these two commandment . the question about Davids Son .         while the Pharisees be gather together , Jesus question they ,         say , what be your opinion about the Messiah ? whose son be he ? they reply , Davids .      he say to they , how , then , do David , inspire by the Spirit , call he lord , say :      the Lord say to my lord ,   sit at my right hand   until I place your enemy under your foot ?      if David call he lord , how can he be his son ?       no one be able to answer he a word , nor from that day on do anyone dare to ask he any more question .
