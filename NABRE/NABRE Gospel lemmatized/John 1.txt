b '    in the beginning    be the Word ,   and the Word be with God ,   and the Word be God .    he be in the beginning with God .    all thing come to be through he ,   and without he nothing come to be .   what come to be      through he be life ,   and this life be the light of the human race ;     the light shine in the darkness ,    and the darkness have not overcome it .      a man name John be send from God .        he come for testimony ,    to testify to the light , so that all might believe through he .        he be not the light , but come to testify to the light .        the true light , which enlighten everyone , be come into the world .      he be in the world ,   and the world come to be through he ,   but the world do not know he .   he come to what be his own ,   but his own people    do not accept he .      but to those who do accept he he give power to become child of God , to those who believe in his name ,        who be bear not by natural generation nor by human choice nor by a mans decision but of God .     and the Word become flesh    and make his dwelling among we ,   and we see his glory ,   the glory as of the Fathers only Son ,   full of grace and truth .       John testify to he and cry out , say , this be he of whom I say ,    the one who be come after I rank ahead of I because he exist before I .      from his fullness we have all receive , grace in place of grace ,        because while the law be give through Moses , grace and truth come through Jesus Christ .        no one have ever see God . the only Son , God ,    who be at the Fathers side , have reveal he .     II . the Book of Signs John the Baptists Testimony to himself .      and this be the testimony of John . when the Jews    from Jerusalem send priest and levite [ to he ] to ask he , who be you ?       he admit and do not deny it , but admit ,    I be not the Messiah .      so they ask he , what be you then ? be you Elijah ?    and he say , I be not . be you the Prophet ? he answer , no .        so they say to he , who be you , so we can give an answer to those who send we ? what do you have to say for yourself ?      he say : I be the voice of one cry out in the desert ,   make straight the way of the Lord ,   as Isaiah the prophet say .      some Pharisees    be also send .      they ask he , why then do you baptize if you be not the Messiah or Elijah or the Prophet ?        John answer they , I baptize with water ;    but there be one among you whom you do not recognize ,        the one who be come after I , whose sandal strap I be not worthy to untie .      this happen in Bethany across the Jordan ,    where John be baptize .

I do not know he ,    but the reason why I come baptize with water be that he might be make known to Israel .      John testify far , say , I see the Spirit come down like a dove    from the sky and remain upon he .      I do not know he ,    but the one who send I to baptize with water tell I , on whomever you see the Spirit come down and remain , he be the one who will baptize with the holy Spirit .          now I have see and testify that he be the Son of God .         the next day John be there again with two of his disciple ,      and as he watch Jesus walk by , he say , Behold , the Lamb of God .        the two disciple    hear what he say and follow Jesus .      Jesus turn and see they follow he and say to they , what be you look for ? they say to he , Rabbi ( which translate mean teacher ) , where be you stay ?      he say to they , come , and you will see . so they go and see where he be stay , and they stay with he that day . it be about four in the afternoon .

Jesus look at he and say , you be Simon the son of John ;    you will be call Cephas ( which be translate Peter ) .      the next day he    decide to go to Galilee , and he find Philip . and Jesus say to he , follow I .      now Philip be from Bethsaida , the town of Andrew and Peter .      Philip find Nathanael and tell he , we have find the one about whom Moses write in the law , and also the prophet , Jesus son of Joseph , from Nazareth .        but Nathanael say to he , can anything good come from Nazareth ? Philip say to he , come and see .      Jesus see Nathanael come toward he and say of he , here be a true Israelite .    there be no duplicity in he .        Nathanael say to he , how do you know I ? Jesus answer and say to he , before Philip call you , I see you under the fig tree .      Nathanael answer he , Rabbi , you be the Son of God ;    you be the King of Israel .        Jesus answer and say to he , do you believe because I tell you that I see you under the fig tree ?    you will see great thing than this .      and he say to he , amen , amen ,    I say to you , you will see the sky open and the angel of God ascend and descend on the Son of Man .
