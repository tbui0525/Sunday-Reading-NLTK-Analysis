b '   the Prayer of Jesus .      when Jesus have say this , he raise his eye to heaven    and say , Father , the hour have come . give glory to your son , so that your son may glorify you ,         just as you give he authority over all people ,    so that he may give eternal life to all you give he .       now this be eternal life ,    that they should know you , the only true God , and the one whom you send , Jesus Christ .      I glorify you on earth by accomplish the work that you give I to do .      now glorify I , Father , with you , with the glory that I have with you before the world begin .      I reveal your name    to those whom you give I out of the world . they belong to you , and you give they to I , and they have keep your word .      now they know that everything you give I be from you ,      because the word you give to I I have give to they , and they accept they and truly understand that I come from you , and they have believe that you send I .      I pray for they . I do not pray for the world but for the one you have give I , because they be yours ,        and everything of mine be yours and everything of yours be mine , and I have be glorify in they .        and now I will no long be in the world , but they be in the world , while I be come to you . Holy Father , keep they in your name that you have give I , so that they may be one just as we be .      when I be with they I protect they in your name that you give I , and I guard they , and none of they be lose except the son of destruction , in order that the scripture might be fulfil .        but now I be come to you . I speak this in the world so that they may share my joy completely .        I give they your word , and the world hate they , because they do not belong to the world any more than I belong to the world .         I do not ask that you take they out of the world    but that you keep they from the evil one .      they do not belong to the world any more than I belong to the world .      consecrate they in the truth . your word be truth .        as you send I into the world , so I send they into the world .        and I consecrate myself for they , so that they also may be consecrate in truth .     I pray not only for they , but also for those who will believe in I through their word ,      so that they may all be one , as you , Father , be in I and I in you , that they also may be in we , that the world may believe that you send I .        and I have give they the glory you give I , so that they may be one , as we be one ,      I in they and you in I , that they may be bring to perfection as one , that the world may know that you send I , and that you love they even as you love I .      Father , they be your gift to I . I wish that where I be    they also may be with I , that they may see my glory that you give I , because you love I before the foundation of the world .        Righteous Father , the world also do not know you , but I know you , and they know that you send I .        I make known to they your name and I will make it know ,    that the love with which you love I may be in they and I in they .             '
