b '   the Transfiguration of Jesus .       after six day Jesus take Peter , James , and John his brother , and lead they up a high mountain by themselves .          and he be transfigure before they ; his face shine like the sun and his clothe become white as light .       and behold , Moses and Elijah appear to they , converse with he .      then Peter say to Jesus in reply , Lord , it be good that we be here . if you wish , I will make three tent    here , one for you , one for Moses , and one for Elijah .       while he be still speak , behold , a bright cloud cast a shadow over they ,    then from the cloud come a voice that say , this be my beloved Son , with whom I be well pleased ; listen to he .       when the disciple hear this , they fall prostrate and be very much afraid .      but Jesus come and touch they , say , rise , and do not be afraid .      and when the disciple raise their eye , they see no one else but Jesus alone . the coming of Elijah .         as they be come down from the mountain , Jesus charge they , do not tell the vision    to anyone until the Son of Man have be raise from the dead .        then the disciple ask he , why do the scribe say that Elijah must come first ?       he say in reply ,    Elijah will indeed come and restore all thing ;       but I tell you that Elijah have already come , and they do not recognize he but do to he whatever they please . so also will the Son of Man suffer at their hand .       then the disciple understand that he be speak to they of John the Baptist . the Healing of a boy with a Demon .         when they come to the crowd a man approach , kneel down before he ,      and say , Lord , have pity on my son , for he be a lunatic    and suffer severely ; often he fall into fire , and often into water .      I bring he to your disciple , but they could not cure he .       Jesus say in reply , o faithless and perverse    generation , how long will I be with you ? how long will I endure you ? bring he here to I .      Jesus rebuke he and the demon come out of he ,    and from that hour the boy be cure .      then the disciple approach Jesus in private and say , why could we not drive it out ?        he say to they , because of your little faith . amen , I say to you , if you have faith the size of a mustard seed , you will say to this mountain , move from here to there , and it will move . nothing will be impossible for you .     [   ]   the Second Prediction of the passion .         as they be gather in Galilee , Jesus say to they , the Son of Man be to be hand over to man ,      and they will kill he , and he will be raise on the third day . and they be overwhelmed with grief . payment of the Temple Tax .         when they come to Capernaum , the collector of the temple tax    approach Peter and say , do not your teacher pay the temple tax ?      yes , he say .    when he come into the house , before he have time to speak , Jesus ask he , what be your opinion , Simon ? from whom do the king of the earth take toll or census tax ? from their subject or from foreigner ?       when he say , from foreigner , Jesus say to he , then the subject be exempt .      but that we may not offend they ,    go to the sea , drop in a hook , and take the first fish that come up . open its mouth and you will find a coin worth twice the temple tax . give that to they for I and for you .
