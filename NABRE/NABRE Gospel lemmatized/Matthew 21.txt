Jesus enter the temple area and drive out all those engage in sell and buy there . he overturn the table of the money changer and the seat of those who be sell dove .          and he say to they , it be write : my house shall be a house of prayer ,    but you be make it a den of thief .      the blind and the lame    approach he in the temple area , and he cure they .      when the chief priest and the scribe see the wondrous thing    he be do , and the child cry out in the temple area , Hosanna to the Son of David , they be indignant        and say to he , do you hear what they be say ? Jesus say to they , yes ; and have you never read the text , out of the mouth of infant and nursling you have bring forth praise ?      and leave they , he go out of the city to Bethany , and there he spend the night . the cursing of the Fig Tree .         when he be go back to the city in the morning , he be hungry .       see a fig tree by the road , he go over to it , but find nothing on it except leave . and he say to it , may no fruit ever come from you again . and immediately the fig tree wither .      when the disciple see this , they be amazed and say , how be it that the fig tree wither immediately ?        Jesus say to they in reply , amen , I say to you , if you have faith and do not waver , not only will you do what have be do to the fig tree , but even if you say to this mountain , be lift up and throw into the sea , it will be do .       whatever you ask for in prayer with faith , you will receive . the Authority of Jesus question .         when he have come into the temple area , the chief priest and the elder of the people approach he as he be teach and say , by what authority be you do these thing ?    and who give you this authority ?        Jesus say to they in reply , I shall ask you one question ,    and if you answer it for I , then I shall tell you by what authority I do these thing .      where be Johns baptism from ? be it of heavenly or of human origin ? they discuss this among themselves and say , if we say of heavenly origin , he will say to we , then why do you not believe he ?        but if we say , of human origin , we fear the crowd , for they all regard John as a prophet .      so they say to Jesus in reply , we do not know . he himself say to they , neither shall I tell you by what authority I do these thing .   the parable of the Two Sons .        what be your opinion ? a man have two son . he come to the first and say , Son , go out and work in the vineyard today .      he say in reply , I will not , but afterwards he change his mind and go .      the man come to the other son and give the same order . he say in reply , yes , sir , but do not go .       which of the two do his father will ? they answer , the first . Jesus say to they , amen , I say to you , tax collector and prostitute be enter the kingdom of God before you .        when John come to you in the way of righteousness , you do not believe he ; but tax collector and prostitute do . yet even when you see that , you do not later change your mind and believe he . the parable of the Tenants .         hear another parable . there be a landowner who plant a vineyard ,    put a hedge around it , dig a wine press in it , and build a tower . then he lease it to tenant and go on a journey .        when vintage time draw near , he send his servant    to the tenant to obtain his produce .      but the tenant seize the servant and one they beat , another they kill , and a third they stone .      again he send other servant , more numerous than the first one , but they treat they in the same way .      finally , he send his son to they , think , they will respect my son .       but when the tenant see the son , they say to one another , this be the heir . come , let we kill he and acquire his inheritance .        they seize he , throw he out of the vineyard , and kill he .      what will the owner of the vineyard do to those tenant when he come ?      they answer    he , he will put those wretched man to a wretched death and lease his vineyard to other tenant who will give he the produce at the proper time .        Jesus say to they , do you never read in the scripture : the stone that the builder reject   have become the cornerstone ; by the Lord have this be do ,   and it be wonderful in our eye ?      therefore , I say to you , the kingdom of God will be take away from you and give to a people that will produce its fruit .      [    the one who fall on this stone will be dash to piece ; and it will crush anyone on whom it fall . ]      when the chief priest and the Pharisees    hear his parable , they know that he be speak about they .      and although they be attempt to arrest he , they fear the crowd , for they regard he as a prophet .
