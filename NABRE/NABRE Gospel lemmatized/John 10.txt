b '   the good Shepherd .      amen , amen , I say to you ,    whoever do not enter a sheepfold    through the gate but climb over elsewhere be a thief and a robber .      but whoever enter through the gate be the shepherd of the sheep .      the gatekeeper open it for he , and the sheep hear his voice , as he call his own sheep by name and lead they out .       when he have drive out all his own , he walk ahead of they , and the sheep follow he ,    because they recognize his voice .      but they will not follow a stranger ; they will run away from he , because they do not recognize the voice of stranger .      although Jesus use this figure of speech ,    they do not realize what he be try to tell they .      so Jesus say again , amen , amen , I say to you , I be the gate for the sheep .       all who come [ before I ] be thief and robber , but the sheep do not listen to they .      I be the gate . whoever enter through I will be save , and will come in and go out and find pasture .      a thief come only to steal and slaughter and destroy ; I come so that they might have life and have it more abundantly .      I be the good shepherd . a good shepherd lay down his life for the sheep .        a hire man , who be not a shepherd and whose sheep be not his own , see a wolf coming and leave the sheep and run away , and the wolf catch and scatter they .        this be because he work for pay and have no concern for the sheep .      I be the good shepherd , and I know mine and mine know I ,      just as the Father know I and I know the Father ; and I will lay down my life for the sheep .        I have other sheep    that do not belong to this fold . these also I must lead , and they will hear my voice , and there will be one flock , one shepherd .        this be why the Father love I , because I lie down my life in order to take it up again .        no one take it from I , but I lie it down on my own . I have power to lay it down , and power to take it up again .    this command I have receive from my Father .      again there be a division among the Jews because of these word .        many of they say , he be possess and out of his mind ; why listen to he ?        other say , these be not the word of one possess ; surely a demon can not open the eye of the blind , can he ?     Feast of the Dedication .     the feast of the Dedication    be then take place in Jerusalem . it be winter .         and Jesus walk about in the temple area on the Portico of Solomon .      so the Jews gather around he and say to he , how long be you go to keep we in suspense ?    if you be the Messiah , tell we plainly .        Jesus answer they , I tell you    and you do not believe . the work I do in my Fathers name testify to I .        but you do not believe , because you be not among my sheep .        my sheep hear my voice ; I know they , and they follow I .      I give they eternal life , and they shall never perish . no one can take they out of my hand .        my Father , who have give they to I , be great than all ,    and no one can take they out of the Fathers hand .         the Father and I be one .      the Jews again pick up rock to stone he .        Jesus answer they , I have show you many good work from my Father . for which of these be you try to stone I ?      the Jews answer he , we be not stone you for a good work but for blasphemy . you , a man , be make yourself God .         Jesus answer they ,    be it not write in your law , I say , you be god ?      if it call they god to whom the word of God come , and scripture can not be set aside ,      can you say that the one whom the Father have consecrate    and send into the world blaspheme because I say , I be the Son of God ?        if I do not perform my Fathers work , do not believe I ;      but if I perform they , even if you do not believe I , believe the work , so that you may realize [ and understand ] that the Father be in I and I be in the Father .        [ then ] they try again to arrest he ; but he escape from their power .     he go back across the Jordan to the place where John first baptize , and there he remain .        many come to he and say , John perform no sign ,    but everything John say about this man be true .      and many there begin to believe in he .
