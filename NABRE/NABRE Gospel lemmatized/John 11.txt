b '   the Raising of Lazarus .      now a man be ill , Lazarus from Bethany ,    the village of Mary and her sister Martha .      Mary be the one who have anoint the Lord with perfumed oil and dry his foot with her hair ; it be her brother Lazarus who be ill .      so the sister send word to he , say , Master , the one you love be ill .      when Jesus hear this he say , this illness be not to end in death ,    but be for the glory of God , that the Son of God may be glorify through it .        now Jesus love Martha and her sister and Lazarus .      so when he hear that he be ill , he remain for two day in the place where he be .      then after this he say to his disciple , let we go back to Judea .      the disciple say to he , Rabbi , the Jews be just try to stone you , and you want to go back there ?        Jesus answer , be there not twelve hour in a day ? if one walk during the day ,    he do not stumble , because he see the light of this world .        but if one walk at night , he stumble , because the light be not in he .        he say this , and then tell they , our friend Lazarus be asleep , but I be go to awaken he .      so the disciple say to he , Master , if he be asleep , he will be save .      but Jesus be talk about his death , while they think that he mean ordinary sleep .        so then Jesus say to they clearly , Lazarus have die .      and I be glad for you that I be not there , that you may believe . let we go to he .      so Thomas , call Didymus ,    say to his fellow disciple , let we also go to die with he .      when Jesus arrive , he find that Lazarus have already be in the tomb for four day .      now Bethany be near Jerusalem , only about two mile    away .      and many of the Jews have come to Martha and Mary to comfort they about their brother .        when Martha hear that Jesus be come , she go to meet he ; but Mary sit at home .      Martha say to Jesus , Lord , if you have be here , my brother would not have die .        [ but ] even now I know that whatever you ask of God , God will give you .      Jesus say to she , your brother will rise .      Martha say to he , I know he will rise , in the resurrection on the last day .        Jesus tell she , I be the resurrection and the life ; whoever believe in I , even if he die , will live ,        and everyone who live and believe in I will never die . do you believe this ?        she say to he , yes , Lord . I have come to believe that you be the Messiah , the Son of God , the one who be come into the world .     when she have say this , she go and call her sister Mary secretly , say , the teacher be here and be ask for you .      as soon as she hear this , she rise quickly and go to he .      for Jesus have not yet come into the village , but be still where Martha have meet he .      so when the Jews who be with she in the house comfort she see Mary get up quickly and go out , they follow she , presume that she be go to the tomb to weep there .      when Mary come to where Jesus be and see he , she fall at his foot and say to he , Lord , if you have be here , my brother would not have die .      when Jesus see her weeping and the Jews who have come with her weeping , he became perturb    and deeply troubled ,      and say , where have you lay he ? they say to he , Sir , come and see .      and Jesus weep .        so the Jews say , see how he love he .      but some of they say , could not the one who open the eye of the blind man have do something so that this man would not have die ?     so Jesus , perturb again , come to the tomb . it be a cave , and a stone lie across it .      Jesus say , take away the stone . Martha , the dead mans sister , say to he , Lord , by now there will be a stench ; he have be dead for four day .      Jesus say to she , do I not tell you that if you believe you will see the glory of God ?      so they take away the stone . and Jesus raise his eye and say , Father ,    I thank you for hear I .      I know that you always hear I ; but because of the crowd here I have say this , that they may believe that you send I .        and when he have say this , he cry out in a loud voice ,    Lazarus , come out !      the dead man come out , tie hand and foot with burial band , and his face be wrap in a cloth . so Jesus say to they , untie he and let he go .    Session of the Sanhedrin .     now many of the Jews who have come to Mary and see what he have do begin to believe in he .        but some of they go to the Pharisees and tell they what Jesus have do .      so the chief priest and the Pharisees convene the Sanhedrin and say , what be we go to do ? this man be perform many sign .        if we leave he alone , all will believe in he , and the Romans will come    and take away both our land and our nation .       but one of they , Caiaphas , who be high priest that year ,    say to they , you know nothing ,      nor do you consider that it be well for you that one man should die instead of the people , so that the whole nation may not perish .      he do not say this on his own , but since he be high priest for that year , he prophesy that Jesus be go to die for the nation ,      and not only for the nation , but also to gather into one the disperse child of God .        so from that day on they plan to kill he .      so Jesus no long walk about in public among the Jews , but he leave for the region near the desert , to a town call Ephraim ,    and there he remain with his disciple .    the last Passover .     now the Passover of the Jews be near , and many go up from the country to Jerusalem before Passover to purify    themselves .        they look for Jesus and say to one another as they be in the temple area , what do you think ? that he will not come to the feast ?      for the chief priest and the Pharisees have give order that if anyone know where he be , he should inform they , so that they might arrest he .
