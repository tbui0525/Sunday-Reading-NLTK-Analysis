b '   the Man bear Blind .      as he pass by he see a man blind from birth .         his disciple ask he ,    Rabbi , who sin , this man or his parent , that he be bear blind ?      Jesus answer , neither he nor his parent sin ; it be so that the work of God might be make visible through he .        we have to do the work of the one who send I while it be day . night be come when no one can work .        while I be in the world , I be the light of the world .        when he have say this , he spit on the ground and make clay with the saliva , and smear the clay on his eye ,        and say to he , go wash    in the Pool of Siloam ( which mean Sent ) . so he go and wash , and come back able to see .      his neighbor and those who have see he early as a beggar say , be not this the one who use to sit and beg ?      some say , it be , but other say , no , he just look like he . he say , I be .      so they say to he , [ so ] how be your eye open ?      he reply , the man call Jesus make clay and anoint my eye and tell I , go to Siloam and wash . so I go there and wash and be able to see .      and they say to he , where be he ? he say , I do not know .     they bring the one who be once blind to the Pharisees .      now Jesus have make clay    and open his eye on a sabbath .        so then the Pharisees also ask he how he be able to see . he say to they , he put clay on my eye , and I wash , and now I can see .      so some of the Pharisees say , this man be not from God , because he do not keep the sabbath . [ but ] other say , how can a sinful man do such sign ? and there be a division among they .        so they say to the blind man again , what do you have to say about he , since he open your eye ? he say , he be a prophet .      now the Jews do not believe that he have be blind and gain his sight until they summon the parent of the one who have gain his sight .      they ask they , be this your son , who you say be bear blind ? how do he now see ?      his parent answer and say , we know that this be our son and that he be bear blind .      we do not know how he see now , nor do we know who open his eye . ask he , he be of age ; he can speak for himself .        his parent say this because they be afraid of the Jews , for the Jews have already agree that if anyone acknowledge he as the Messiah , he would be expel from the synagogue .      for this reason his parent say , he be of age ; question he .      so a second time they call the man who have be blind and say to he , give God the praise !    we know that this man be a sinner .        he reply , if he be a sinner , I do not know . one thing I do know be that I be blind and now I see .      so they say to he , what do he do to you ? how do he open your eye ?      he answer they , I tell you already and you do not listen . why do you want to hear it again ? do you want to become his disciple , too ?      they ridicule he and say , you be that mans disciple ; we be disciple of Moses !      we know that God speak to Moses , but we do not know where this one be from .        the man answer and say to they , this be what be so amazing , that you do not know where he be from , yet he open my eye .      we know that God do not listen to sinner , but if one be devout and do his will , he listen to he .         it be unheard of that anyone ever open the eye of a person bear blind .      if this man be not from God , he would not be able to do anything .        they answer and say to he , you be bear totally in sin , and be you try to teach we ? then they throw he out .     when Jesus hear that they have throw he out , he find he and say , do you believe in the Son of Man ?      he answer and say , who be he , sir , that I may believe in he ?      Jesus say to he , you have see he and the one speak with you be he .        he say , I do believe , Lord , and he worship he .       then Jesus say , I come into this world for judgment , so that those who do not see might see , and those who do see might become blind .      some of the Pharisees who be with he hear this and say to he , surely we be not also blind , be we ?        Jesus say to they , if you be blind , you would have no sin ; but now you be say , we see , so your sin remain .              '
