b '   Nicodemus .       now there be a Pharisee name Nicodemus , a ruler of the Jews .        he come to Jesus at night and say to he , Rabbi , we know that you be a teacher who have come from God , for no one can do these sign that you be do unless God be with he .        Jesus answer and say to he , amen , amen , I say to you , no one can see the kingdom of God without be bear    from above .      Nicodemus say to he , how can a person once grow old be bear again ? surely he can not reenter his mother womb and be bear again , can he ?        Jesus answer , amen , amen , I say to you , no one can enter the kingdom of God without be bear of water and Spirit .        what be bear of flesh be flesh and what be bear of spirit be spirit .        do not be amazed that I tell you , you must be bear from above .      the wind    blow where it will , and you can hear the sound it make , but you do not know where it come from or where it go ; so it be with everyone who be bear of the Spirit .        Nicodemus answer and say to he , how can this happen ?      Jesus answer and say to he , you be the teacher of Israel and you do not understand this ?      amen , amen , I say to you , we speak of what we know and we testify to what we have see , but you people do not accept our testimony .        if I tell you about earthly thing and you do not believe , how will you believe if I tell you about heavenly thing ?        no one have go up to heaven except the one who have come down from heaven , the Son of Man .        and just as Moses lift up    the serpent in the desert , so must the Son of Man be lift up ,         so that everyone who believe in he may have eternal life .     for God so love the world that he give    his only Son , so that everyone who believe in he might not perish but might have eternal life .        for God do not send his Son into the world to condemn    the world , but that the world might be save through he .        whoever believe in he will not be condemn , but whoever do not believe have already be condemn , because he have not believe in the name of the only Son of God .         and this be the verdict ,    that the light come into the world , but people prefer darkness to light , because their work be evil .      for everyone who do wicke thing hate the light and do not come toward the light , so that his work might not be expose .        but whoever live the truth come to the light , so that his work may be clearly see as do in God .     Final Witness of the Baptist .      after this , Jesus and his disciple go into the region of Judea , where he spend some time with they baptize .        John be also baptize in Aenon near Salim ,    because there be an abundance of water there , and people come to be baptize ,        for John have not yet be imprison .      now a dispute arise between the disciple of John and a Jew    about ceremonial washing .      so they come to John and say to he , Rabbi , the one who be with you across the Jordan , to whom you testify , here he be baptize and everyone be come to he .        John answer and say , no one can receive anything except what have be give he from heaven .        you yourself can testify that I say [ that ] I be not the Messiah , but that I be send before he .        the one who have the bride be the bridegroom ; the good man ,    who stand and listen to he , rejoice greatly at the bridegroom voice . so this joy of mine have be make complete .        he must increase ; I must decrease .   the One from Heaven .        the one who come from above be above all . the one who be of the earth be earthly and speak of earthly thing . but the one who come from heaven [ be above all ] .        he testify to what he have see and hear , but no one accept his testimony .        whoever do accept his testimony certify that God be trustworthy .        for the one whom God send speak the word of God . he do not ration his gift    of the Spirit .      the Father love the Son and have give everything over to he .        whoever believe in the Son have eternal life , but whoever disobey the Son will not see life , but the wrath of God remain upon he .
