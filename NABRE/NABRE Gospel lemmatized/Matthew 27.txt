b '   Jesus before Pilate .      when it be morning ,    all the chief priest and the elder of the people take counsel    against Jesus to put he to death .      they bind he , lead he away , and hand he over to Pilate , the governor .    the death of Judas .      then Judas , his betrayer , see that Jesus have be condemn , deeply regret what he have do . he return the thirty piece of silver    to the chief priest and elder ,        say , I have sin in betray innocent blood . they say , what be that to we ? look to it yourself .       fling the money into the temple , he depart and go off and hang himself .      the chief priest gather up the money , but say , it be not lawful to deposit this in the temple treasury , for it be the price of blood .      after consultation , they use it to buy the potter field as a burial place for foreigner .      that be why that field even today be call the Field of blood .      then be fulfil what have be say through Jeremiah the prophet ,    and they take the thirty piece of silver , the value of a man with a price on his head , a price set by some of the Israelites ,       and they pay it out for the potter field just as the Lord have command I .    Jesus question by Pilate .      now Jesus stand before the governor , and he question he , be you the king of the Jews ?    Jesus say , you say so .       and when he be accuse by the chief priest and elder ,    he make no answer .      then Pilate say to he , do you not hear how many thing they be testify against you ?      but he do not answer he one word , so that the governor be greatly amazed .    the Sentence of Death .       now on the occasion of the feast the governor be accustom to release to the crowd one prisoner whom they wish .       and at that time they have a notorious prisoner call [ Jesus ] Barabbas .      so when they have assemble , Pilate say to they , which one do you want I to release to you , [ Jesus ] Barabbas , or Jesus call Messiah ?       for he know that it be out of envy that they have hand he over .       while he be still seat on the bench , his wife send he a message , have nothing to do with that righteous man . I suffer much in a dream today because of he .       the chief priest and the elder persuade the crowd to ask for Barabbas but to destroy Jesus .      the governor say to they in reply , which of the two do you want I to release to you ? they answer , Barabbas !       Pilate say to they , then what shall I do with Jesus call Messiah ? they all say , let he be crucify !      but he say , why ? what evil have he do ? they only shout the louder , let he be crucify !        when Pilate see that he be not succeed at all , but that a riot be break out instead , he take water and wash his hand in the sight of the crowd , say , I be innocent of this mans blood . look to it yourself .      and the whole people say in reply , his blood be upon we and upon our child .      then he release Barabbas to they , but after he have Jesus scourge ,    he hand he over to be crucify .    Mockery by the Soldiers .      then the soldier of the governor take Jesus inside the praetorium    and gather the whole cohort around he .      they strip off his clothe and throw a scarlet military cloak    about he .       weave a crown out of thorn ,    they place it on his head , and a reed in his right hand . and kneel before he , they mock he , say , hail , king of the Jews !       they spit upon he    and take the reed and keep strike he on the head .      and when they have mock he , they strip he of the cloak , dress he in his own clothe , and lead he off to crucify he . the way of the Cross .         as they be go out , they meet a Cyrenian name Simon ; this man they press into service to carry his cross .    the Crucifixion .      and when they come to a place call Golgotha ( which mean Place of the Skull ) ,       they give Jesus wine to drink mix with gall .    but when he have taste it , he refuse to drink .       after they have crucify he , they divide his garment    by cast lot ;      then they sit down and keep watch over he there .      and they place over his head the write charge    against he : this be Jesus , the king of the Jews .      two revolutionary    be crucify with he , one on his right and the other on his left .        those pass by revile he , shake their head       and say , you who would destroy the temple and rebuild it in three day , save yourself , if you be the Son of God , [ and ] come down from the cross !      likewise the chief priest with the scribe and elder mock he and say ,      he save other ; he can not save himself . so he be the king of Israel !    let he come down from the cross now , and we will believe in he .        he trust in God ; let he deliver he now if he want he . for he say , I be the Son of God .      the revolutionary who be crucify with he also keep abuse he in the same way .    the death of Jesus .       from noon onward ,    darkness come over the whole land until three in the afternoon .       and about three oclock Jesus cry out in a loud voice ,   Eli , Eli , lema sabachthani ?     which mean , my God , my God , why have you forsake I ?       some of the bystander who hear it say , this one be call for Elijah .       immediately one of they run to get a sponge ; he soak it in wine , and put it on a reed , give it to he to drink .      but the rest say , wait , let we see if Elijah come to save he .       but Jesus cry out again in a loud voice , and give up his spirit .       and behold , the veil of the sanctuary be tear in two from top to bottom .    the earth quake , rock be split ,       tomb be open , and the body of many saint who have fall asleep be raise .      and come forth from their tomb after his resurrection , they enter the holy city and appear to many .       the centurion and the man with he who be keep watch over Jesus fear greatly when they see the earthquake and all that be happen , and they say , truly , this be the Son of God !      there be many woman there , look on from a distance ,    who have follow Jesus from Galilee , minister to he .       among they be Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James and Joseph , and the mother of the son of Zebedee . the burial of Jesus .         when it be evening , there come a rich man from Arimathea name Joseph , who be himself a disciple of Jesus .        he go to Pilate and ask for the body of Jesus ; then Pilate order it to be hand over .      take the body , Joseph wrap it [ in ] clean linen      and lay it in his new tomb that he have hew in the rock . then he roll a huge stone across the entrance to the tomb and depart .      but Mary Magdalene and the other Mary remained sit there , face the tomb . the Guard at the Tomb .        the next day , the one follow the day of preparation ,    the chief priest and the Pharisees gather before Pilate       and say , Sir , we remember that this impostor while still alive say , after three day I will be raise up .      give order , then , that the grave be secure until the third day , lest his disciple come and steal he and say to the people , he have be raise from the dead . this last imposture would be bad than the first .        Pilate say to they , the guard be your ;    go secure it as well you can .      so they go and secure the tomb by fix a seal to the stone and set the guard .             '
