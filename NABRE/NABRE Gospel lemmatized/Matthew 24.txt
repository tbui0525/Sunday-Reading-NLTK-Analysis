b '   the destruction of the Temple Foretold .       Jesus leave the temple area and be go away , when his disciple approach he to point out the temple building .       he say to they in reply , you see all these thing , do you not ? amen , I say to you , there will not be leave here a stone upon another stone that will not be throw down .    the beginning of calamity .     as he be sit on the Mount of Olives ,    the disciple approach he privately and say , tell we , when will this happen , and what sign will there be of your coming , and of the end of the age ?       Jesus say to they in reply , see that no one deceive you .      for many will come in my name , say , I be the Messiah , and they will deceive many .       you will hear of war    and report of war ; see that you be not alarmed , for these thing must happen , but it will not yet be the end .       nation will rise against nation , and kingdom against kingdom ; there will be famine and earthquake from place to place .       all these be the beginning of the labor pain .        then they will hand you over to persecution , and they will kill you . you will be hate by all nation because of my name .      and then many will be lead into sin ; they will betray and hate one another .      many false prophet will arise and deceive many ;      and because of the increase of evildoing , the love of many will grow cold .       but the one who persevere to the end will be save .       and this gospel of the kingdom will be preach throughout the world as a witness to all nation ,    and then the end will come . the Great Tribulation .         when you see the desolating abomination    speak of through Daniel the prophet stand in the holy place ( let the reader understand ) ,      then those in Judea must flee    to the mountain ,        a person on the housetop must not go down to get thing out of his house ,      a person in the field must not return to get his cloak .      Woe to pregnant woman and nursing mother in those day .       pray that your flight not be in winter or on the sabbath ,        for at that time there will be great tribulation , such as have not be since the beginning of the world until now , nor ever will be .      and if those day have not be shorten , no one would be save ; but for the sake of the elect they will be shorten .       if anyone say to you then , look , here be the Messiah ! or , there he be ! do not believe it .      false messiah and false prophet will arise , and they will perform sign and wonder so great as to deceive , if that be possible , even the elect .      behold , I have tell it to you beforehand .      so if they say to you , he be in the desert , do not go out there ; if they say , he be in the inner room , do not believe it .         for just as lightning come from the east and be see as far as the west , so will the come of the Son of Man be .      wherever the corpse be , there the vulture will gather .    the coming of the Son of Man .       immediately after the tribulation of those day , the sun will be darken ,   and the moon will not give its light , and the star will fall from the sky ,   and the power of the heaven will be shake .      and then the sign of the Son of Man    will appear in heaven , and all the tribe of the earth will mourn , and they will see the Son of Man come upon the cloud of heaven with power and great glory .       and he will send out his angel    with a trumpet blast , and they will gather his elect from the four wind , from one end of the heaven to the other . the Lesson of the Fig Tree .        learn a lesson from the fig tree . when its branch become tender and sprout leave , you know that summer be near .      in the same way , when you see all these thing , know that he be near , at the gate .      amen , I say to you , this generation    will not pass away until all these thing have take place .       Heaven and earth will pass away , but my word will not pass away . the unknown Day and Hour .         but of that day and hour no one know , neither the angel of heaven , nor the Son ,    but the Father alone .        for as it be in the day of Noah , so it will be at the coming of the Son of Man .      in [ those ] day before the flood , they be eat and drink , marry and give in marriage , up to the day that Noah enter the ark .      they do not know until the flood come and carry they all away . so will it be [ also ] at the coming of the Son of Man .        two man will be out in the field ; one will be take , and one will be leave .      two woman will be grind at the mill ; one will be take , and one will be leave .        therefore , stay awake ! for you do not know on which day your Lord will come .       be sure of this : if the master of the house have know the hour of night when the thief be come , he would have stay awake and not let his house be break into .      so too , you also must be prepare , for at an hour you do not expect , the Son of Man will come . the Faithful or the unfaithful servant .         who , then , be the faithful and prudent servant , whom the master have put in charge of his household to distribute to they their food at the proper time ?        bless be that servant whom his master on his arrival find do so .      amen , I say to you , he will put he in charge of all his property .       but if that wicked servant say to himself , my master be long delay ,      and begin to beat his fellow servant , and eat and drink with drunkard ,      the servant master will come on an unexpected day and at an unknown hour       and will punish he severely    and assign he a place with the hypocrite , where there will be wail and grinding of tooth .
