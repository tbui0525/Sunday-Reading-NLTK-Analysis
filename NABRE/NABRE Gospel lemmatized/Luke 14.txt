b '   healing of the Man with Dropsy on the Sabbath .       on a sabbath he go to dine at the home of one of the lead Pharisees , and the people there be observe he carefully .        in front of he there be a man suffer from dropsy .        Jesus speak to the scholar of the law and Pharisees in reply , ask , be it lawful to cure on the sabbath or not ?        but they keep silent ; so he take the man and , after he have heal he , dismiss he .      then he say to they , who among you , if your son or ox    fall into a cistern , would not immediately pull he out on the sabbath day ?        but they be unable to answer his question .   Conduct of Invited Guests and Hosts .         he tell a parable to those who have be invite , notice how they be choose the place of honor at the table .       when you be invite by someone to a wedding banquet , do not recline at table in the place of honor . a more distinguished guest than you may have be invite by he ,      and the host who invite both of you may approach you and say , give your place to this man , and then you would proceed with embarrassment to take the low place .      rather , when you be invite , go and take the low place so that when the host come to you he may say , my friend , move up to a high position . then you will enjoy the esteem of your companion at the table .      for everyone who exalt himself will be humble , but the one who humble himself will be exalt .        then he say to the host who invite he , when you hold a lunch or a dinner , do not invite your friend or your brother or your relative or your wealthy neighbor , in case they may invite you back and you have repayment .        rather , when you hold a banquet , invite the poor , the crippled , the lame , the blind ;      bless indeed will you be because of their inability to repay you . for you will be repay at the resurrection of the righteous .   the parable of the Great Feast .        one of his fellow guest on hear this say to he , bless be the one who will dine in the kingdom of God .       he reply to he , a man give a great dinner to which he invite many .      when the time for the dinner come , he dispatch his servant to say to those invite , come , everything be now ready .      but one by one , they all begin to excuse themselves . the first say to he , I have purchase a field and must go to examine it ; I ask you , consider I excuse .      and another say , I have purchase five yoke of oxen and be on my way to evaluate they ; I ask you , consider I excuse .      and another say , I have just marry a woman , and therefore I can not come .      the servant go and report this to his master . then the master of the house in a rage command his servant , go out quickly into the street and alley of the town and bring in here the poor and the crippled , the blind and the lame .      the servant report , Sir , your order have be carry out and still there be room .      the master then order the servant , go out to the highway and hedgerow and make people come in that my home may be fill .      for , I tell you , none of those man who be invite will taste my dinner . saying on Discipleship .        great crowd be travel with he , and he turn and address they ,       if any one come to I without hate his father    and mother , wife and child , brother and sister , and even his own life , he can not be my disciple .        whoever do not carry his own cross and come after I can not be my disciple .        which of you wish to construct a tower do not first sit down and calculate the cost to see if there be enough for its completion ?      otherwise , after lay the foundation and find himself unable to finish the work the onlooker should laugh at he      and say , this one begin to build but do not have the resource to finish .      or what king march into battle would not first sit down and decide whether with ten thousand troop he can successfully oppose another king advance upon he with twenty thousand troop ?      but if not , while he be still far away , he will send a delegation to ask for peace term .      in the same way , everyone of you who do not renounce all his possession can not be my disciple .   the simile of Salt .        Salt be good , but if salt itself lose its taste , with what can its flavor be restore ?        it be fit neither for the soil nor for the manure pile ; it be throw out . whoever have ear to hear ought to hear .
