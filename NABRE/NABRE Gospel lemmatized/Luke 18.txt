I tell you , he will see to it that justice be do for they speedily . but when the Son of Man come , will he find faith on earth ?    the parable of the Pharisee and the Tax Collector .     he then address this parable to those who be convince of their own righteousness and despise everyone else .        two people go up to the temple area to pray ; one be a Pharisee and the other be a tax collector .      the Pharisee take up his position and speak this prayer to himself , o God , I thank you that I be not like the rest of humanity\xe2\x80\x94greedy , dishonest , adulterous\xe2\x80\x94or even like this tax collector .      I fast twice a week , and I pay tithe on my whole income .        but the tax collector stand off at a distance and would not even raise his eye to heaven but beat his breast and pray , o God , be merciful to I a sinner .        I tell you , the latter go home justify , not the former ; for everyone who exalt himself will be humble , and the one who humble himself will be exalt .     say on child and the Kingdom .      People be bring even infant to he that he might touch they ,    and when the disciple see this , they rebuke they .        Jesus , however , call the child to himself and say , let the child come to I and do not prevent they ; for the kingdom of God belong to such as these .      amen , I say to you , whoever do not accept the kingdom of God like a child will not enter it .     the Rich Official .      an official ask he this question , good teacher , what must I do to inherit eternal life ?        Jesus answer he , why do you call I good ? no one be good but God alone .      you know the commandment , you shall not commit adultery ; you shall not kill ; you shall not steal ; you shall not bear false witness ; honor your father and your mother .        and he reply , all of these I have observe from my youth .        when Jesus hear this he say to he , there be still one thing leave for you : sell all that you have and distribute it to the poor , and you will have a treasure in heaven . then come , follow I .      but when he hear this he become quite sad , for he be very rich .    on Riches and Renunciation .     Jesus look at he [ now sad ] and say , how hard it be for those who have wealth to enter the kingdom of God !      for it be easy for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God .      those who hear this say , then who can be save ?      and he say , what be impossible for human being be possible for God .        then Peter say , we have give up our possession and follow you .       he say to they , amen , I say to you , there be no one who have give up house or wife or brother or parent or child for the sake of the kingdom of God      who will not receive [ back ] an overabundant return in this present age and eternal life in the age to come . the Third Prediction of the passion .         then he take the twelve aside and say to they , behold , we be go up to Jerusalem and everything write by the prophet about the Son of Man will be fulfil .         he will be hand over to the Gentiles and he will be mock and insult and spat upon ;      and after they have scourge he they will kill he , but on the third day he will rise .      but they understand nothing of this ; the word remain hidden from they and they fail to comprehend what he say .   the Healing of the Blind Beggar .        now as he approach Jericho a blind man be sit by the roadside beg ,      and hear a crowd go by , he inquire what be happen .      they tell he , Jesus of Nazareth be pass by .       he shout , Jesus , Son of David ,    have pity on I !      the people walk in front rebuke he , tell he to be silent , but he keep call out all the more , Son of David , have pity on I !      then Jesus stop and order that he be bring to he ; and when he come near , Jesus ask he ,      what do you want I to do for you ? he reply , Lord , please let I see .        Jesus tell he , have sight ; your faith have save you .        he immediately receive his sight and follow he , give glory to God . when they see this , all the people give praise to God .
