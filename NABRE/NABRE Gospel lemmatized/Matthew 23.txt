b ' denunciation of the Scribes and Pharisees .      then Jesus speak to the crowd and to his disciple ,       say , the scribe and the Pharisees have take their seat on the chair of Moses .      therefore , do and observe all thing whatsoever they tell you , but do not follow their example . for they preach but they do not practice .       they tie up heavy burden    [ hard to carry ] and lie they on people shoulder , but they will not lift a finger to move they .        all their work be perform to be see . they widen their phylactery and lengthen their tassel .        they love place of honor at banquet , seat of honor in synagogue ,      greeting in marketplace , and the salutation Rabbi .       as for you , do not be call Rabbi . you have but one teacher , and you be all brother .      call no one on earth your father ; you have but one Father in heaven .      do not be call Master ; you have but one master , the Messiah .       the great among you must be your servant .       whoever exalt himself will be humble ; but whoever humble himself will be exalt .       Woe to you , scribe and Pharisees , you hypocrite . you lock the kingdom of heaven    before human being . you do not enter yourself , nor do you allow entrance to those try to enter .     [   ]       Woe to you , scribe and Pharisees , you hypocrite . you traverse sea and land to make one convert , and when that happen you make he a child of Gehenna twice as much as yourself .       Woe to you , blind guide , who say , if one swear by the temple , it mean nothing , but if one swear by the gold of the temple , one be obligated .      blind fool , which be great , the gold , or the temple that make the gold sacred ?      and you say , if one swear by the altar , it mean nothing , but if one swear by the gift on the altar , one be obligated .      you blind one , which be great , the gift , or the altar that make the gift sacred ?       one who swear by the altar swear by it and all that be upon it ;      one who swear by the temple swear by it and by he who dwell in it ;      one who swear by heaven swear by the throne of God and by he who be seat on it .      Woe to you , scribe and Pharisees , you hypocrite . you pay tithe    of mint and dill and cummin , and have neglect the weightier thing of the law : judgment and mercy and fidelity . [ but ] these you should have do , without neglect the other .        Blind guide , who strain out the gnat and swallow the camel !       Woe to you , scribe and Pharisees , you hypocrite . you cleanse the outside of cup and dish , but inside they be full of plunder and self - indulgence .      Blind Pharisee , cleanse first the inside of the cup , so that the outside also may be clean .      Woe to you , scribe and Pharisees , you hypocrite . you be like whitewashed tomb , which appear beautiful on the outside , but inside be full of dead men bone and every kind of filth .       even so , on the outside you appear righteous , but inside you be fill with hypocrisy and evildoing .      Woe to you , scribe and Pharisees ,    you hypocrite . you build the tomb of the prophet and adorn the memorial of the righteous ,       and you say , if we have live in the day of our ancestor , we would not have join they in shed the prophet blood .       thus you bear witness against yourself that you be the child of those who murder the prophet ;      now fill up what your ancestor measure out !       you serpent , you brood of viper , how can you flee from the judgment of Gehenna ?        therefore , behold , I send to you prophet and wise man and scribe ; some of they you will kill and crucify , some of they you will scourge in your synagogue and pursue from town to town ,      so that there may come upon you all the righteous blood shed upon earth , from the righteous blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah , the son of Barachiah , whom you murder between the sanctuary and the altar .      amen , I say to you , all these thing will come upon this generation . the Lament over Jerusalem .         Jerusalem , Jerusalem , you who kill the prophet and stone those send to you , how many time I yearn to gather your child together , as a hen gather her young under her wing , but you be unwilling !         behold , your house will be abandon , desolate .       I tell you , you will not see I again until you say , bless be he who come in the name of the Lord .             '
