b '   the Feast of Tabernacles .      after this , Jesus move about within Galilee ; but he do not wish to travel in Judea , because the Jews be try to kill he .        but the jewish feast of Tabernacles be near .        so his brother    say to he , leave here and go to Judea , so that your disciple also may see the work you be do .      no one work in secret if he want to be know publicly . if you do these thing , manifest yourself to the world .        for his brother do not believe in he .       so Jesus say to they , my time be not yet here , but the time be always right for you .      the world can not hate you , but it hate I , because I testify to it that its work be evil .        you go up to the feast . I be not go up    to this feast , because my time have not yet be fulfil .      after he have say this , he stay on in Galilee .     but when his brother have go up to the feast , he himself also go up , not openly but [ as it be ] in secret .      the Jews be look for he at the feast and say , where be he ?      and there be considerable murmur about he in the crowd . some say , he be a good man , [ while ] other say , No ; on the contrary , he mislead the crowd .      still , no one speak openly about he because they be afraid of the Jews .   the First Dialogue .        when the feast be already half over , Jesus go up into the temple area and begin to teach .        the Jews be amazed and say , how do he know scripture without having study ?      Jesus answer they and say , my teaching be not my own but be from the one who send I .      whoever choose to do his will    shall know whether my teaching be from God or whether I speak on my own .        whoever speak on his own seek his own glory , but whoever seek the glory of the one who send he be truthful , and there be no wrong in he .      do not Moses give you the law ? yet none of you keep the law . why be you try to kill I ?        the crowd answer , you be possess !    who be try to kill you ?        Jesus answer and say to they , I perform one work    and all of you be amazed        because of it . Moses give you circumcision\xe2\x80\x94not that it come from Moses but rather from the patriarchs\xe2\x80\x94and you circumcise a man on the sabbath .        if a man can receive circumcision on a sabbath so that the law of Moses may not be break , be you angry with I because I make a whole person well on a sabbath ?        stop judge by appearance , but judge justly .      so some of the inhabitant of Jerusalem say , be he not the one they be try to kill ?      and look , he be speak openly and they say nothing to he . could the authority    have realize that he be the Messiah ?      but we know where he be from . when the Messiah come , no one will know where he be from .        so Jesus cry out in the temple area as he be teach and say , you know I and also know where I be from . yet I do not come on my own , but the one who send I , whom you do not know , be true .        I know he , because I be from he , and he send I .        so they try to arrest he , but no one lay a hand upon he , because his hour have not yet come .        but many of the crowd begin to believe in he , and say , when the Messiah come , will he perform more sign than this man have do ?   officer send to arrest Jesus .        the Pharisees hear the crowd murmur about he to this effect , and the chief priest and the Pharisees send guard to arrest he .      so Jesus say , I will be with you only a little while long , and then I will go to the one who send I .        you will look for I but not find [ I ] , and where I be you can not come .        so the Jews say to one another , where be he go that we will not find he ? surely he be not go to the dispersion    among the Greeks to teach the Greeks , be he ?      what be the meaning of his saying , you will look for I and not find [ I ] , and where I be you can not come ? river of Living Water .        on the last and great day of the feast , Jesus stand up and exclaim , let anyone who thirst come to I and drink .        whoever believe in I , as scripture say : river of live water    will flow from within he .      he say this in reference to the Spirit that those who come to believe in he be to receive . there be , of course , no Spirit yet ,    because Jesus have not yet be glorify .   discussion about the Origins of the Messiah .        some in the crowd who hear these word say , this be truly the Prophet .        other say , this be the Messiah . but other say , the Messiah will not come from Galilee , will he ?      do not scripture say that the Messiah will be of Davids family and come from Bethlehem , the village where David live ?        so a division occur in the crowd because of he .      some of they even want to arrest he , but no one lay hand on he .     so the guard go to the chief priest and Pharisees , who ask they , why do you not bring he ?      the guard answer , never before have anyone speak like this one .      so the Pharisees answer they , have you also be deceive ?      have any of the authority or the Pharisees believe in he ?        but this crowd , which do not know the law , be accurse .      Nicodemus , one of their member who have come to he early , say to they ,        do our law condemn a person before it first hear he and find out what he be do ?        they answer and say to he , you be not from Galilee also , be you ? look and see that no prophet arise from Galilee .    chapter 8 a woman catch in Adultery .
