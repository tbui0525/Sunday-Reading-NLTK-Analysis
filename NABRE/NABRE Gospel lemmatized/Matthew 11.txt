b '    when Jesus finish give these command to his twelve disciple ,    he go away from that place to teach and to preach in their town .     the Messengers from John the Baptist .       when John hear in prison    of the work of the Messiah , he send his disciple to he       with this question , be you the one who be to come , or should we look for another ?      Jesus say to they in reply , go and tell John what you hear and see :       the blind regain their sight , the lame walk , leper be cleanse , the deaf hear , the dead be raise , and the poor have the good news proclaim to they .        and bless be the one who take no offense at I . Jesus Testimony to John .        as they be go off , Jesus begin to speak to the crowd about John , what do you go out to the desert to see ? a reed sway by the wind ?        then what do you go out to see ? someone dress in fine clothing ? those who wear fine clothing be in royal palace .      then why do you go out ? to see a prophet ?    yes , I tell you , and more than a prophet .      this be the one about whom it be write : behold , I be send my messenger ahead of you ;   he will prepare your way before you .      amen , I say to you , among those bear of woman there have be none great than John the Baptist ; yet the least in the kingdom of heaven be great than he .        from the day of John the Baptist until now , the kingdom of heaven suffer violence ,    and the violent be take it by force .        all the prophet and the law    prophesy up to the time of John .      and if you be willing to accept it , he be Elijah , the one who be to come .        whoever have ear ought to hear .      to what shall I compare this generation ?    it be like child who sit in marketplace and call to one another ,      we play the flute for you , but you do not dance , we sing a dirge but you do not mourn .      for John come neither eat nor drink , and they say , he be possess by a demon .        the Son of Man come eat and drink and they say , look , he be a glutton and a drunkard , a friend of tax collector and sinner . but wisdom be vindicate by her work .     Reproaches to Unrepentant town .      then he begin to reproach the town where most of his mighty deed have be do , since they have not repent .      Woe to you , Chorazin ! woe to you , Bethsaida ! for if the mighty deed do in your midst have be do in Tyre and Sidon ,    they would long ago have repent in sackcloth and ashe .        but I tell you , it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you .       and as for you , Capernaum : will you be exalt to heaven ?    you will go down to the netherworld . for if the mighty deed do in your midst have be do in Sodom , it would have remain until this day .      but I tell you , it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom on the day of judgment than for you .     the praise of the Father .      at that time Jesus say in reply ,    I give praise to you , Father , Lord of heaven and earth , for although you have hide these thing from the wise and the learn you have reveal they to the childlike .      yes , Father , such have be your gracious will .      all thing have be hand over to I by my Father . no one know the Son except the Father , and no one know the Father except the Son and anyone to whom the Son wish to reveal he .     the Gentle Mastery of Christ .      come to I , all you who labor and be burden ,    and I will give you rest .        take my yoke upon you and learn from I , for I be meek and humble of heart ; and you will find rest for yourself .      for my yoke be easy , and my burden light .
