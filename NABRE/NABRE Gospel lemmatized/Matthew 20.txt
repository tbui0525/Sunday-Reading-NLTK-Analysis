b '   the Workers in the Vineyard .      the kingdom of heaven be like a landowner who go out at dawn to hire laborer for his vineyard .      after agree with they for the usual daily wage , he send they into his vineyard .      go out about nine oclock , he see other stand idle in the marketplace ,       and he say to they , you too go into my vineyard , and I will give you what be just .      so they go off . [ and ] he go out again around noon , and around three oclock , and do likewise .      go out about five oclock , he find other stand around , and say to they , why do you stand here idle all day ?      they answer , because no one have hire we . he say to they , you too go into my vineyard .        when it be even the owner of the vineyard say to his foreman , summon the laborer and give they their pay , begin with the last and end with the first .      when those who have start about five oclock come , each receive the usual daily wage .      so when the first come , they think that they would receive more , but each of they also get the usual wage .      and on receive it they grumble against the landowner ,      say , these last one work only one hour , and you have make they equal to we , who bear the day burden and the heat .      he say to one of they in reply , my friend , I be not cheat you .    do you not agree with I for the usual daily wage ?       take what be yours and go . what if I wish to give this last one the same as you ?      [ or ] be I not free to do as I wish with my own money ? be you envious because I be generous ?       thus , the last will be first , and the first will be last . the Third Prediction of the passion .         as Jesus be go up to Jerusalem , he take the twelve [ disciple ] aside by themselves , and say to they on the way ,      behold , we be go up to Jerusalem , and the Son of Man will be hand over to the chief priest and the scribe , and they will condemn he to death ,      and hand he over to the Gentiles to be mock and scourge and crucify , and he will be raise on the third day . the request of James and John .         then the mother    of the son of Zebedee approach he with her son and do he homage , wish to ask he for something .      he say to she , what do you wish ? she answer he , Command that these two son of mine sit , one at your right and the other at your left , in your kingdom .      Jesus say in reply , you do not know what you be ask .    can you drink the cup that I be go to drink ? they say to he , we can .      he reply , my cup you will indeed drink , but to sit at my right and at my left [ , this ] be not mine to give but be for those for whom it have be prepare by my Father .       when the ten hear this , they become indignant at the two brother .      but Jesus summon they and say , you know that the ruler of the Gentiles lord it over they , and the great one make their authority over they feel .      but it shall not be so among you . rather , whoever wish to be great among you shall be your servant ;       whoever wish to be first among you shall be your slave .       just so , the Son of Man do not come to be serve but to serve and to give his life as a ransom    for many . the Healing of two Blind Men .         as they leave Jericho , a great crowd follow he .       two blind man be sit by the roadside , and when they hear that Jesus be pass by , they cry out , [ Lord , ]    Son of David , have pity on we !      the crowd warn they to be silent , but they call out all the more , Lord , Son of David , have pity on we !      Jesus stop and call they and say , what do you want I to do for you ?      they answer he , Lord , let our eye be open .      move with pity , Jesus touch their eye . immediately they receive their sight , and follow he .
