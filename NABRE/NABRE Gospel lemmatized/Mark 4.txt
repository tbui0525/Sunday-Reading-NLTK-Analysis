b '   the parable of the Sower .      on another occasion    he begin to teach by the sea .    a very large crowd gather around he so that he get into a boat on the sea and sit down . and the whole crowd be beside the sea on land .        and he teach they at length in parable , and in the course of his instruction he say to they ,       hear this ! a sower go out to sow .      and as he sow , some seed fall on the path , and the bird come and eat it up .      other seed fall on rocky ground where it have little soil . it spring up at once because the soil be not deep .      and when the sun rise , it be scorch and it wither for lack of root .      some seed fall among thorn , and the thorn grow up and choke it and it produce no grain .      and some seed fall on rich soil and produce fruit . it come up and grow and yield thirty , sixty , and a hundredfold .      he add , whoever have ear to hear ought to hear .    the Purpose of the Parables .     and when he be alone , those present along with the Twelve question he about the parable .       he answer they , the mystery of the kingdom of God have be grant to you . but to those outside everything come in parable ,      so that they may look and see but not perceive ,   and hear and listen but not understand , in order that they may not be convert and be forgive .       Jesus say to they , do you not understand this parable ?    then how will you understand any of the parable ?      the sower sow the word .      these be the one on the path where the word be sow . as soon as they hear , Satan come at once and take away the word sow in they .      and these be the one sow on rocky ground who , when they hear the word , receive it at once with joy .      but they have no root ; they last only for a time . then when tribulation or persecution come because of the word , they quickly fall away .      those sow among thorn be another sort . they be the people who hear the word ,      but worldly anxiety , the lure of rich , and the craving for other thing intrude and choke the word , and it bear no fruit .      but those sow on rich soil be the one who hear the word and accept it and bear fruit thirty and sixty and a hundredfold .    parable of the Lamp .      he say to they , be a lamp bring in to be place under a bushel basket or under a bed , and not to be place on a lampstand ?        for there be nothing hide except to be make visible ; nothing be secret except to come to light .        anyone who have ear to hear ought to hear .      he also tell they , take care what you hear . the measure with which you measure will be measure out to you , and still more will be give to you .        to the one who have , more will be give ; from the one who have not , even what he have will be take away .     seed grow of itself .     he say , this be how it be with the kingdom of God ;    it be as if a man be to scatter seed    on the land      and would sleep and rise night and day and the seed would sprout and grow , he know not how .      of its own accord the land yield fruit , first the blade , then the ear , then the full grain in the ear .      and when the grain be ripe , he wield the sickle at once , for the harvest have come .    the Mustard Seed .      he say , to what shall we compare the kingdom of God , or what parable can we use for it ?      it be like a mustard seed that , when it be sow in the ground , be the small of all the seed on the earth .       but once it be sow , it spring up and become the large of plant and put forth large branch , so that the bird of the sky can dwell in its shade .      with many such parable    he speak the word to they as they be able to understand it .      without parable he do not speak to they , but to his own disciple he explain everything in private .    the calming of a storm at Sea .      on that day , as evening draw on , he say to they , let we cross to the other side .        leave the crowd , they take he with they in the boat just as he be . and other boat be with he .      a violent squall come up and wave be break over the boat , so that it be already fill up .      Jesus be in the stern , asleep on a cushion . they wake he and say to he , teacher , do you not care that we be perish ?      he wake up , rebuke the wind , and say to the sea , quiet ! be still !    the wind cease and there be great calm .      then he ask they , why be you terrified ? do you not yet have faith ?        they be fill with great awe and say to one another , who then be this whom even wind and sea obey ?
