b '   the parable of the Sower .      on that day , Jesus go out of the house and sit down by the sea .        such large crowd gather around he that he get into a boat and sit down , and the whole crowd stand along the shore .       and he speak to they at length in parable ,    say : a sower go out to sow .      and as he sow , some seed fall on the path , and bird come and eat it up .      some fall on rocky ground , where it have little soil . it spring up at once because the soil be not deep ,      and when the sun rise it be scorch , and it wither for lack of root .      some seed fall among thorn , and the thorn grow up and choke it .      but some seed fall on rich soil , and produce fruit , a hundred or sixty or thirtyfold .      whoever have ear ought to hear .    the Purpose of Parables .     the disciple approach he and say , why do you speak to they in parable ?       he say to they in reply , because knowledge of the mystery of the kingdom of heaven have be grant to you , but to they it have not be grant .       to anyone who have , more will be give    and he will grow rich ; from anyone who have not , even what he have will be take away .        this be why I speak to they in parable , because they look but do not see and hear but do not listen or understand .       Isaiahs prophecy be fulfil in they , which say : you shall indeed hear but not understand ,   you shall indeed look but never see .   Gross be the heart of this people ,   they will hardly hear with their ear ,   they have close their eye ,   lest they see with their eye   and hear with their ear and understand with their heart and be convert ,   and I heal they . the Privilege of Discipleship .         but bless be your eye , because they see , and your ear , because they hear .      amen , I say to you , many prophet and righteous people long to see what you see but do not see it , and to hear what you hear but do not hear it . the Explanation of the Parable of the Sower .         hear then the parable of the sower .      the seed sow on the path be the one who hear the word of the kingdom without understand it , and the evil one come and steal away what be sow in his heart .      the seed sow on rocky ground be the one who hear the word and receive it at once with joy .      but he have no root and last only for a time . when some tribulation or persecution come because of the word , he immediately fall away .      the seed sow among thorn be the one who hear the word , but then worldly anxiety and the lure of rich choke the word and it bear no fruit .      but the seed sow on rich soil be the one who hear the word and understand it , who indeed bear fruit and yield a hundred or sixty or thirtyfold .    the parable of the weed among the wheat .     he propose another parable to they .    the kingdom of heaven may be liken to a man who sow good seed in his field .      while everyone be asleep his enemy come and sow weed    all through the wheat , and then go off .      when the crop grow and bore fruit , the weed appear as well .      the slave of the householder come to he and say , Master , do you not sow good seed in your field ? where have the weed come from ?      he answer , an enemy have do this . his slave say to he , do you want we to go and pull they up ?      he reply , no , if you pull up the weed you might uproot the wheat along with they .      let they grow together until harvest ;    then at harvest time I will say to the harvester , first collect the weed and tie they in bundle for burn ; but gather the wheat into my barn .   the parable of the Mustard Seed .         he propose another parable to they . the kingdom of heaven be like a mustard seed that a person take and sow in a field .        it be the small of all the seed , yet when full - grown it be the large of plant . it become a large bush , and the bird of the sky come and dwell in its branch .    the parable of the Yeast .     he speak to they another parable . the kingdom of heaven be like yeast    that a woman take and mix with three measure of wheat flour until the whole batch be leaven .     the Use of Parables .       all these thing Jesus speak to the crowd in parable . he speak to they only in parable ,      to fulfill what have be say through the prophet :   I will open my mouth in parable ,   I will announce what have lie hide from the foundation [ of the world ] .     the Explanation of the Parable of the weed .     then , dismiss the crowd ,    he go into the house . his disciple approach he and say , explain to we the parable of the weed in the field .       he say in reply , he who sow good seed be the Son of Man ,      the field be the world ,    the good seed the child of the kingdom . the weed be the child of the evil one ,      and the enemy who sow they be the devil . the harvest be the end of the age ,    and the harvester be angel .      just as weed be collect and burn [ up ] with fire , so will it be at the end of the age .      the Son of Man will send his angel , and they will collect out of his kingdom    all who cause other to sin and all evildoer .       they will throw they into the fiery furnace , where there will be wail and grinding of tooth .        then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father . whoever have ear ought to hear . More Parables .         the kingdom of heaven be like a treasure bury in a field ,    which a person find and hide again , and out of joy go and sell all that he have and buy that field .      again , the kingdom of heaven be like a merchant search for fine pearl .      when he find a pearl of great price , he go and sell all that he have and buy it .      again , the kingdom of heaven be like a net throw into the sea , which collect fish of every kind .      when it be full they haul it ashore and sit down to put what be good into bucket . what be bad they throw away .      thus it will be at the end of the age . the angel will go out and separate the wicked from the righteous      and throw they into the fiery furnace , where there will be wail and grinding of tooth .    Treasures New and Old .     do you understand    all these thing ? they answer , yes .       and he reply , then every scribe who have be instruct in the kingdom of heaven be like the head of a household who bring from his storeroom both the new and the old .      when Jesus finish these parable , he go away from there .     the Rejection at Nazareth .      he come to his native place and teach the people in their synagogue .    they be astonish    and say , where do this man get such wisdom and mighty deed ?        be he not the carpenter son ? be not his mother name Mary and his brother James , Joseph , Simon , and Judas ?        be not his sister all with we ? where do this man get all this ?      and they take offense at he . but Jesus say to they , a prophet be not without honor except in his native place and in his own house .        and he do not work many mighty deed there because of their lack of faith .
