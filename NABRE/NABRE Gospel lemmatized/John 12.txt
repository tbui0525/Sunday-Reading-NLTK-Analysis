b '   the Anointing at Bethany .       six day before Passover Jesus come to Bethany , where Lazarus be , whom Jesus have raise from the dead .        they give a dinner for he there , and Martha serve , while Lazarus be one of those recline at table with he .        Mary take a liter of costly perfumed oil make from genuine aromatic nard and anoint the foot of Jesus    and dry they with her hair ; the house be fill with the fragrance of the oil .        then Judas the Iscariot , one [ of ] his disciple , and the one who would betray he , say ,      why be this oil not sell for three hundred day wage    and give to the poor ?      he say this not because he care about the poor but because he be a thief and hold the money bag and use to steal the contribution .        so Jesus say , leave she alone . let she keep this for the day of my burial .        you always have the poor with you , but you do not always have I .      [ the ] large crowd of the Jews find out that he be there and come , not only because of Jesus , but also to see Lazarus , whom he have raise from the dead .        and the chief priest plot to kill Lazarus too ,      because many of the Jews be turn away and believe in Jesus because of he .   the Entry into Jerusalem .         on the next day , when the great crowd that have come to the feast hear that Jesus be come to Jerusalem ,      they take palm branch    and go out to meet he , and cry out : Hosanna ! bless be he who come in the name of the Lord ,   [ even ] the king of Israel .      Jesus find an ass and sit upon it , as be write :     fear no more , o daughter Zion ;    see , your king come , seat upon an asss colt .      his disciple do not understand this at first , but when Jesus have be glorify they remember that these thing be write about he and that they have do this    for he .         so the crowd that be with he when he call Lazarus from the tomb and raise he from death continue to testify .      this be [ also ] why the crowd go to meet he , because they hear that he have do this sign .      so the Pharisees say to one another , you see that you be gain nothing . look , the whole world    have go after he .   the coming of Jesus Hour .        now there be some Greeks    among those who have come up to worship at the feast .         they come to Philip , who be from Bethsaida in Galilee , and ask he , Sir , we would like to see Jesus .        Philip go and tell Andrew ; then Andrew and Philip go and tell Jesus .         Jesus answer they ,    the hour have come for the Son of Man to be glorify .       amen , amen , I say to you , unless a grain of wheat fall to the ground and die , it remain just a grain of wheat ;    but if it die , it produce much fruit .      whoever love his life    lose it , and whoever hate his life in this world will preserve it for eternal life .        whoever serve I must follow I , and where I be , there also will my servant be . the Father will honor whoever serve I .      I be troubled    now . yet what should I say ? Father , save I from this hour ? but it be for this purpose that I come to this hour .        Father , glorify your name . then a voice come from heaven , I have glorify it and will glorify it again .        the crowd there hear it and say it be thunder ; but other say , an angel have speak to he .        Jesus answer and say , this voice do not come for my sake but for yours .        now be the time of judgment on this world ; now the ruler of this world    will be drive out .        and when I be lift up from the earth , I will draw everyone to myself .        he say this indicate the kind of death he would die .      so the crowd answer he , we have hear from the law that the Messiah remain forever .    then how can you say that the Son of Man must be lift up ? who be this Son of Man ?        Jesus say to they , the light will be among you only a little while . walk while you have the light , so that darkness may not overcome you . whoever walk in the dark do not know where he be go .        while you have the light , believe in the light , so that you may become child of the light .   Unbelief and belief among the Jews .   after he have say this , Jesus leave and hide from they .        although he have perform so many sign in their presence they do not believe in he ,       in order that the word which Isaiah the prophet speak might be fulfil : Lord , who have believe our preaching ,   to whom have the might of the Lord be reveal ?      for this reason they could not believe , because again Isaiah say :     he blind their eye   and harden their heart , so that they might not see with their eye   and understand with their heart and be convert , and I would heal they .      Isaiah say this because he see his glory    and speak about he .        nevertheless , many , even among the authority , believe in he , but because of the Pharisees they do not acknowledge it openly in order not to be expel from the synagogue .        for they prefer human praise to the glory of God .     recapitulation .     Jesus cry out and say , whoever believe in I believe not only in I but also in the one who send I ,        and whoever see I see the one who send I .        I come into the world as light , so that everyone who believe in I might not remain in darkness .        and if anyone hear my word and do not observe they , I do not condemn he , for I do not come to condemn the world but to save the world .        whoever reject I and do not accept my word have something to judge he : the word that I speak , it will condemn he on the last day ,        because I do not speak on my own , but the Father who send I command I what to say and speak .        and I know that his commandment be eternal life . so what I say , I say as the Father tell I .
