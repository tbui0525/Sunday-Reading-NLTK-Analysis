b '   the Vine and the Branches .      I be the true vine ,    and my Father be the vine grower .        he take away every branch in I that do not bear fruit , and every one that do he prune    so that it bear more fruit .      you be already prune because of the word that I speak to you .        remain in I , as I remain in you . just as a branch can not bear fruit on its own unless it remain on the vine , so neither can you unless you remain in I .      I be the vine , you be the branch . whoever remain in I and I in he will bear much fruit , because without I you can do nothing .        anyone who do not remain in I will be throw out like a branch and wither ; people will gather they and throw they into a fire and they will be burn .      if you remain in I and my word remain in you , ask for whatever you want and it will be do for you .        by this be my Father glorify , that you bear much fruit and become my disciple .        as the Father love I , so I also love you . remain in my love .        if you keep my commandment , you will remain in my love , just as I have keep my Fathers commandment and remain in his love .      I have tell you this so that my joy may be in you and your joy may be complete .        this be my commandment : love one another as I love you .         no one have great love than this ,    to lay down one life for one friend .      you be my friend if you do what I command you .      I no long call you slave , because a slave do not know what his master be do . I have call you friend ,    because I have tell you everything I have hear from my Father .        it be not you who choose I , but I who choose you and appoint you to go and bear fruit that will remain , so that whatever you ask the Father in my name he may give you .        this I command you : love one another .   the Worlds Hatred .        if the world hate you , realize that it hate I first .        if you belong to the world , the world would love its own ; but because you do not belong to the world , and I have choose you out of the world , the world hate you .        remember the word I speak to you ,    no slave be great than his master . if they persecute I , they will also persecute you . if they keep my word , they will also keep yours .        and they will do all these thing to you on account of my name ,    because they do not know the one who send I .        if I have not come and speak    to they , they would have no sin ; but as it be they have no excuse for their sin .        whoever hate I also hate my Father .        if I have not do work among they that no one else ever do , they would not have sin ; but as it be , they have see and hate both I and my Father .        but in order that the word write in their law    might be fulfil , they hate I without cause .      when the advocate come whom I will send    you from the Father , the Spirit of truth that proceed from the Father , he will testify to I .        and you also testify , because you have be with I from the beginning .
