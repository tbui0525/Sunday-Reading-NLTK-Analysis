b '   the Healing of a Centurions slave .       when he have finish all his word to the people , he enter Capernaum .        a centurion    there have a slave who be ill and about to die , and he be valuable to he .      when he hear about Jesus , he send elder of the Jews to he , ask he to come and save the life of his slave .      they approach Jesus and strongly urge he to come , say , he deserve to have you do this for he ,      for he love our nation and he build the synagogue for we .      and Jesus go with they , but when he be only a short distance from the house , the centurion send friend to tell he , Lord , do not trouble yourself , for I be not worthy to have you enter under my roof .        therefore , I do not consider myself worthy to come to you ; but say the word and let my servant be heal .      for I too be a person subject to authority , with soldier subject to I . and I say to one , go , and he go ; and to another , come here , and he come ; and to my slave , do this , and he do it .      when Jesus hear this he be amazed at he and , turn , say to the crowd follow he , I tell you , not even in Israel have I find such faith .      when the messenger return to the house , they find the slave in good health . raise of the Widows Son .         soon afterward he journey to a city call Nain , and his disciple and a large crowd accompany he .      as he draw near to the gate of the city , a man who have die be be carry out , the only son of his mother , and she be a widow . a large crowd from the city be with she .        when the Lord see she , he be move with pity for she and say to she , do not weep .      he step forward and touch the coffin ; at this the bearer halt , and he say , young man , I tell you , arise !      the dead man sit up and begin to speak , and Jesus give he to his mother .        fear seize they all , and they glorify God , exclaim , a great prophet have arise in our midst , and God have visit his people .        this report about he spread through the whole of Judea and in all the surround region . the Messengers from John the Baptist .         the disciple of John tell he about all these thing . John summon two of his disciple      and send they to the Lord to ask , be you the one who be to come , or should we look for another ?        when the man come to he , they say , John the Baptist have send we to you to ask , be you the one who be to come , or should we look for another ?      at that time he cure many of their disease , suffering , and evil spirit ; he also grant sight to many who be blind .      and he say to they in reply , go and tell John what you have see and hear : the blind regain their sight , the lame walk , leper be cleanse , the deaf hear , the dead be raise , the poor have the good news proclaim to they .        and bless be the one who take no offense at I .     Jesus Testimony to John .      when the messenger of John have leave , Jesus begin to speak to the crowd about John .    what do you go out to the desert to see\xe2\x80\x94a reed sway by the wind ?      then what do you go out to see ? someone dress in fine garment ? those who dress luxuriously and live sumptuously be find in royal palace .      then what do you go out to see ? a prophet ? yes , I tell you , and more than a prophet .        this be the one about whom scripture say : behold , I be send my messenger ahead of you ,   he will prepare your way before you .      I tell you , among those bear of woman , no one be great than John ; yet the least in the kingdom of God be great than he .       ( all the people who listen , include the tax collector , and who be baptize with the baptism of John , acknowledge the righteousness of God ;      but the Pharisees and scholar of the law , who be not baptize by he , reject the plan of God for themselves . )      then to what shall I compare the people of this generation ? what be they like ?        they be like child who sit in the marketplace and call to one another , we play the flute for you , but you do not dance .   we sing a dirge , but you do not weep .     for John the Baptist come neither eat food nor drink wine , and you say , he be possess by a demon .      the Son of Man come eat and drink and you say , look , he be a glutton and a drunkard , a friend of tax collector and sinner .        but wisdom be vindicate by all her child . the Pardon of the Sinful Woman .         a Pharisee invite he to dine with he , and he enter the Pharisees house and recline at table .        now there be a sinful woman in the city who learn that he be at table in the house of the Pharisee .    bring an alabaster flask of ointment ,        she stand behind he at his foot weep and begin to bathe his foot with her tear . then she wipe they with her hair , kiss they , and anoint they with the ointment .      when the Pharisee who have invite he see this he say to himself , if this man be a prophet , he would know who and what sort of woman this be who be touch he , that she be a sinner .      Jesus say to he in reply , Simon , I have something to say to you . tell I , teacher , he say .      two people be in debt to a certain creditor ; one owe five hundred day wage    and the other owe fifty .      since they be unable to repay the debt , he forgive it for both . which of they will love he more ?      Simon say in reply , the one , I suppose , whose large debt be forgive . he say to he , you have judge rightly .      then he turn to the woman and say to Simon , do you see this woman ? when I enter your house , you do not give I water for my foot , but she have bathe they with her tear and wipe they with her hair .      you do not give I a kiss , but she have not cease kiss my foot since the time I enter .      you do not anoint my head with oil , but she anoint my foot with ointment .      so I tell you , her many sin have be forgive ; hence , she have show great love .    but the one to whom little be forgive , love little .      he say to she , your sin be forgive .        the other at table say to themselves , who be this who even forgive sin ?        but he say to the woman , your faith have save you ; go in peace .
