b '    I have tell you this so that you may not fall away .      they will expel you from the synagogue ; in fact , the hour    be come when everyone who kill you will think he be offer worship to God .        they will do this because they have not know either the Father or I .        I have tell you this so that when their hour come you may remember that I tell you .   Jesus Departure ; come of the Advocate .    I do not tell you this from the beginning , because I be with you .      but now I be go to the one who send I , and not one of you ask I ,    where be you go ?        but because I tell you this , grief have fill your heart .      but I tell you the truth , it be well for you that I go . for if I do not go , the Advocate will not come to you .    but if I go , I will send he to you .       and when he come he will convict the world in regard to sin and righteousness and condemnation :      sin , because they do not believe in I ;        righteousness , because I be go to the Father and you will no long see I ;      condemnation , because the ruler of this world have be condemn .      I have much more to tell you , but you can not bear it now .       but when he come , the Spirit of truth , he will guide you to all truth .    he will not speak on his own , but he will speak what he hear , and will declare to you the thing that be come .      he will glorify I , because he will take from what be mine and declare it to you .      everything that the Father have be mine ; for this reason I tell you that he will take from what be mine and declare it to you .     a little while and you will no long see I , and again a little while later and you will see I .        so some of his disciple say to one another , what do this mean that he be say to we , a little while and you will not see I , and again a little while and you will see I , and because I be go to the Father ?      so they say , what be this little while [ of which he speak ] ? we do not know what he mean .      Jesus know that they want to ask he , so he say to they , be you discuss with one another what I say , a little while and you will not see I , and again a little while and you will see I ?      amen , amen , I say to you , you will weep and mourn , while the world rejoice ; you will grieve , but your grief will become joy .        when a woman be in labor , she be in anguish because her hour have arrive ; but when she have give birth to a child , she no long remember the pain because of her joy that a child have be bear into the world .        so you also be now in anguish . but I will see you again , and your heart will rejoice , and no one will take your joy away from you .        on that day you will not question I about anything . amen , amen , I say to you , whatever you ask the Father in my name he will give you .        until now you have not ask anything in my name ; ask and you will receive , so that your joy may be complete .       I have tell you this in figure of speech . the hour be come when I will no long speak to you in figure but I will tell you clearly about the Father .      on that day you will ask in my name , and I do not tell you that I will ask the Father for you .        for the Father himself love you , because you have love I and have come to believe that I come from God .      I come from the Father and have come into the world . now I be leave the world and go back to the Father .        his disciple say , now you be talk plainly , and not in any figure of speech .      now we realize that you know everything and that you do not need to have anyone question you . because of this we believe that you come from God .        Jesus answer they , do you believe now ?      behold , the hour be come and have arrive when each of you will be scatter    to his own home and you will leave I alone . but I be not alone , because the Father be with I .        I have tell you this so that you might have peace in I . in the world you will have trouble , but take courage , I have conquer the world .              '
