b '   the Resurrection of Jesus .      but at daybreak on the first day of the week they take the spice they have prepare and go to the tomb .      they find the stone roll away from the tomb ;      but when they enter , they do not find the body of the Lord Jesus .      while they be puzzle over this , behold , two man in dazzling garment appear to they .        they be terrify and bow their face to the ground . they say to they , why do you seek the live one among the dead ?        he be not here , but he have be raise .    remember what he say to you while he be still in Galilee ,      that the Son of Man must be hand over to sinner and be crucify , and rise on the third day .        and they remember his word .          then they return from the tomb and announce all these thing to the eleven and to all the other .      the woman be Mary Magdalene , Joanna , and Mary the mother of James ; the other who accompany they also tell this to the apostle ,        but their story seem like nonsense and they do not believe they .        but Peter get up and run to the tomb , bend down , and see the burial cloth alone ; then he go home amazed at what have happen . the appearance on the Road to Emmaus .        now that very day two of they be go to a village seven mile    from Jerusalem call Emmaus ,        and they be converse about all the thing that have occur .      and it happen that while they be converse and debate , Jesus himself draw near and walk with they ,        but their eye be prevent from recognize he .      he ask they , what be you discuss as you walk along ? they stop , look downcast .      one of they , name Cleopas , say to he in reply , be you the only visitor to Jerusalem who do not know of the thing that have take place there in these day ?      and he reply to they , what sort of thing ? they say to he , the thing that happen to Jesus the Nazarene , who be a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people ,        how our chief priest and ruler both hand he over to a sentence of death and crucify he .       but we be hope that he would be the one to redeem Israel ; and besides all this , it be now the third day since this take place .       some woman from our group , however , have astound we : they be at the tomb early in the morning      and do not find his body ; they come back and report that they have indeed see a vision of angel who announce that he be alive .       then some of those with we go to the tomb and find thing just as the woman have describe , but he they do not see .       and he say to they , oh , how foolish you be ! how slow of heart to believe all that the prophet speak !      be it not necessary that the Messiah should suffer    these thing and enter into his glory ?      then begin with Moses and all the prophet , he interpret to they what refer to he in all the scripture .        as they approach the village to which they be go , he give the impression that he be go on far .      but they urge he , stay with we , for it be nearly evening and the day be almost over . so he go in to stay with they .      and it happen that , while he be with they at table , he take bread , say the blessing , break it , and give it to they .      with that their eye be open and they recognize he , but he vanish from their sight .      then they say to each other , be not our heart burn [ within we ] while he speak to we on the way and open the scripture to we ?      so they set out at once and return to Jerusalem where they find gather together the eleven and those with they      who be say , the Lord have truly be raise and have appear to Simon !        then the two recount what have take place on the way and how he be make known to they in the breaking of the bread .    the appearance to the Disciples in Jerusalem .      while they be still speak about this ,    he stand in their midst and say to they , Peace be with you .        but they be startled and terrify and think that they be see a ghost .        then he say to they , why be you troubled ? and why do question arise in your heart ?       look at my hand and my foot , that it be I myself . touch I and see , because a ghost do not have flesh and bone as you can see I have .       and as he say this , he show they his hand and his foot .      while they be still incredulous for joy and be amazed , he ask they , have you anything here to eat ?      they give he a piece of baked fish ;        he take it and eat it in front of they .     he say to they , these be my word that I speak to you while I be still with you , that everything write about I in the law of Moses and in the prophet and psalm must be fulfil .        then he open their mind to understand the scripture .         and he say to they ,    thus it be write that the Messiah would suffer and rise from the dead on the third day      and that repentance , for the forgiveness of sin , would be preach in his name to all the nation , begin from Jerusalem .        you be witness of these thing .        and [ behold ] I be send the promise of my Father    upon you ; but stay in the city until you be clothe with power from on high .   the Ascension .         then he lead they [ out ] as far as Bethany , raise his hand , and bless they .      as he bless they he part from they and be take up to heaven .      they do he homage and then return to Jerusalem with great joy ,        and they be continually in the temple praise God .
