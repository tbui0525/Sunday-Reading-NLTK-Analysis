b '   Jesus arrest .      when he have say this , Jesus go out    with his disciple across the Kidron valley to where there be a garden , into which he and his disciple enter .        Judas his betrayer also know the place , because Jesus have often meet there with his disciple .      so Judas get a band of soldier    and guard from the chief priest and the Pharisees and go there with lantern , torch , and weapon .        Jesus , know everything that be go to happen to he , go out and say to they , whom be you look for ?      they answer he , Jesus the Nazorean .    he say to they , I be . Judas his betrayer be also with they .      when he say to they , I be , they turn away and fall to the ground .      so he again ask they , whom be you look for ? they say , Jesus the Nazorean .      Jesus answer , I tell you that I be . so if you be look for I , let these man go .        this be to fulfill what he have say , I have not lose any of those you give I .      then Simon Peter , who have a sword , draw it , strike the high priest slave , and cut off his right ear . the slave name be Malchus .        Jesus say to Peter , put your sword into its scabbard . shall I not drink the cup    that the Father give I ?       so the band of soldier , the tribune , and the jewish guard seize Jesus , bind he ,      and bring he to Annas    first . he be the father - in - law of Caiaphas , who be high priest that year .        it be Caiaphas who have counsel the Jews that it be well that one man should die rather than the people .   Peters First Denial .        Simon Peter and another disciple    follow Jesus . now the other disciple be know to the high priest , and he enter the courtyard of the high priest with Jesus .      but Peter stand at the gate outside . so the other disciple , the acquaintance of the high priest , go out and speak to the gatekeeper and bring Peter in .      then the maid who be the gatekeeper say to Peter , you be not one of this mans disciple , be you ? he say , I be not .      now the slave and the guard be stand around a charcoal fire that they have make , because it be cold , and be warm themselves . Peter be also stand there keep warm . the Inquiry before Annas .        the high priest question Jesus about his disciple and about his doctrine .      Jesus answer he , I have speak publicly to the world . I have always teach in a synagogue or in the temple area    where all the Jews gather , and in secret I have say nothing .        why ask I ? ask those who hear I what I say to they . they know what I say .      when he have say this , one of the temple guard stand there strike Jesus and say , be this the way you answer the high priest ?        Jesus answer he , if I have speak wrongly , testify to the wrong ; but if I have speak rightly , why do you strike I ?      then Annas send he bind to Caiaphas    the high priest .   Peter Denies Jesus again .        now Simon Peter be stand there keep warm . and they say to he , you be not one of his disciple , be you ? he deny it and say , I be not .      one of the slave of the high priest , a relative of the one whose ear Peter have cut off , say , do not I see you in the garden with he ?      again Peter deny it . and immediately the cock crow .     the Trial before Pilate .      then they bring Jesus from Caiaphas to the praetorium .    it be morning . and they themselves do not enter the praetorium , in order not to be defile so that they could eat the Passover .      so Pilate come out to they and say , what charge do you bring [ against ] this man ?      they answer and say to he , if he be not a criminal , we would not have hand he over to you .      at this , Pilate say to they , take he yourself , and judge he accord to your law . the Jews answer he , we do not have the right to execute anyone ,         in order that the word of Jesus might be fulfil that he say indicate the kind of death    he would die .      so Pilate go back into the praetorium and summon Jesus and say to he , be you the king of the Jews ?      Jesus answer , do you say this on your own or have other tell you about I ?      Pilate answer , I be not a Jew , be I ? your own nation and the chief priest hand you over to I . what have you do ?        Jesus answer , my kingdom do not belong to this world . if my kingdom do belong to this world , my attendant [ would ] be fight to keep I from be hand over to the Jews . but as it be , my kingdom be not here .        so Pilate say to he , then you be a king ? Jesus answer , you say I be a king .    for this I be bear and for this I come into the world , to testify to the truth . everyone who belong to the truth listen to my voice .        Pilate say to he , what be truth ?   when he have say this , he again go out to the Jews and say to they , I find no guilt in he .      but you have a custom that I release one prisoner to you at Passover .    do you want I to release to you the King of the Jews ?      they cry out again , not this one but Barabbas !    now Barabbas be a revolutionary .
