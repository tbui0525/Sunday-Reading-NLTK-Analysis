b '   the destruction of the Temple Foretold .      as he be make his way out of the temple area one of his disciple say to he , look , teacher , what stone and what building !        Jesus say to he , do you see these great building ? there will not be one stone leave upon another that will not be throw down .    the sign of the End .      as he be sit on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple area , Peter , James , John , and Andrew ask he privately ,        tell we , when will this happen , and what sign will there be when all these thing be about to come to an end ?      Jesus begin to say to they , see that no one deceive you .        many will come in my name say , I be he , and they will deceive many .      when you hear of war and report of war do not be alarm ; such thing must happen , but it will not yet be the end .      nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom . there will be earthquake from place to place and there will be famine . these be the beginning of the labor pain .    the Coming Persecution .      watch out for yourself . they will hand you over to the court . you will be beat in synagogue . you will be arraign before governor and king because of I , as a witness before they .      but the gospel must first be preach to all nation .        when they lead you away and hand you over , do not worry beforehand about what you be to say .    but say whatever will be give to you at that hour . for it will not be you who be speak but the holy Spirit .      Brother will hand over brother to death , and the father his child ; child will rise up against parent and have they put to death .      you will be hate by all because of my name . but the one who persevere to the end will be save .    the Great Tribulation .      when you see the desolating abomination standing    where he should not ( let the reader understand ) , then those in Judea must flee to the mountain ,        [ and ] a person on a housetop must not go down or enter to get anything out of his house ,        and a person in a field must not return to get his cloak .      Woe to pregnant woman and nursing mother in those day .      pray that this do not happen in winter .      for those time will have tribulation such as have not be since the beginning of Gods creation until now , nor ever will be .        if the Lord have not shorten those day , no one would be save ; but for the sake of the elect whom he choose , he do shorten the day .      if anyone say to you then , look , here be the Messiah ! look , there he be ! do not believe it .      false messiah and false prophet will arise and will perform sign and wonder in order to mislead , if that be possible , the elect .      be watchful ! I have tell it all to you beforehand .    the coming of the Son of Man .      but in those day after that tribulation the sun will be darken ,   and the moon will not give its light ,    and the star will be fall from the sky ,   and the power in the heaven will be shake .       and then they will see the Son of Man come in the cloud with great power and glory ,      and then he will send out the angel and gather [ his ] elect from the four wind , from the end of the earth to the end of the sky .    the Lesson of the Fig Tree .      learn a lesson from the fig tree . when its branch become tender and sprout leave , you know that summer be near .      in the same way , when you see these thing happen , know that he be near , at the gate .      amen , I say to you , this generation will not pass away until all these thing have take place .      Heaven and earth will pass away , but my word will not pass away .    need for watchfulness .     but of that day or hour , no one know , neither the angel in heaven , nor the Son , but only the Father .       be watchful ! be alert ! you do not know when the time will come .      it be like a man travel abroad . he leave home and place his servant in charge , each with his work , and order the gatekeeper to be on the watch .        Watch , therefore ; you do not know when the lord of the house be come , whether in the evening , or at midnight , or at cockcrow , or in the morning .      may he not come suddenly and find you sleep .      what I say to you , I say to all : watch !
