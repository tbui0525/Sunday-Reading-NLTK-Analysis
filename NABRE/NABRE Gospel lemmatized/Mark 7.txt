b '   the Tradition of the Elders .      now when the Pharisees with some scribe who have come from Jerusalem gather around he ,        they observe that some of his disciple eat their meal with unclean , that is , unwashed , hand .      ( for the Pharisees and , in fact , all Jews , do not eat without carefully wash their hand ,    keep the tradition of the elder .      and on come from the marketplace they do not eat without purify themselves . and there be many other thing that they have traditionally observe , the purification of cup and jug and kettle [ and bed ] . )      so the Pharisees and scribe question he , why do your disciple not follow the tradition of the elder    but instead eat a meal with unclean hand ?      he respond , well do Isaiah prophesy about you hypocrite , as it be write :   this people honor I with their lip ,   but their heart be far from I ;   in vain do they worship I ,   teaching as doctrine human precept .     you disregard Gods commandment but cle to human tradition .      he go on to say , how well you have set aside the commandment of God in order to uphold your tradition !      for Moses say , honor your father and your mother , and whoever curse father or mother shall die .        yet you say , if a person say to father or mother , any support you might have have from I be   qorban     ( meaning , dedicate to God ) ,      you allow he to do nothing more for his father or mother .      you nullify the word of God in favor of your tradition that you have hand on . and you do many such thing .       he summon the crowd again and say to they , hear I , all of you , and understand .      nothing that enter one from outside can defile that person ; but the thing that come out from within be what defile .     [   ]        when he get home away from the crowd his disciple question he about the parable .      he say to they , be even you likewise without understanding ? do you not realize that everything that go into a person from outside can not defile ,        since it enter not the heart but the stomach and pass out into the latrine ? ( thus he declare all food clean . )      but what come out of a person , that be what defile .       from within people , from their heart , come evil thought , unchastity , theft , murder ,      adultery , greed , malice , deceit , licentiousness , envy , blasphemy , arrogance , folly .      all these evil come from within and they defile .    the Syrophoenician Womans Faith .      from that place he go off to the district of Tyre .    he enter a house and want no one to know about it , but he could not escape notice .      soon a woman whose daughter have an unclean spirit hear about he . she come and fall at his foot .      the woman be a Greek , a Syrophoenician by birth , and she beg he to drive the demon out of her daughter .        he say to she , let the child be feed first .    for it be not right to take the food of the child and throw it to the dog .      she reply and say to he , Lord , even the dog under the table eat the children scrap .      then he say to she , for say this , you may go . the demon have go out of your daughter .      when the woman go home , she find the child lie in bed and the demon go .    the Healing of a Deaf Man .      again he leave the district of Tyre and go by way of Sidon to the Sea of Galilee , into the district of the Decapolis .      and people bring to he a deaf man who have a speech impediment and beg he to lay his hand on he .      he take he off by himself away from the crowd . he put his finger into the mans ear and , spit , touch his tongue ;      then he look up to heaven and groan , and say to he ,   Ephphatha ! ( that is , be open ! )      and [ immediately ] the mans ear be open , his speech impediment be remove , and he speak plainly .       he order they not to tell anyone . but the more he order they not to , the more they proclaim it .      they be exceedingly astonished and they say , he have do all thing well . he make the deaf hear and [ the ] mute speak .
