Jesus withdraw toward the sea with his disciple .    a large number of people [ follow ] from Galilee and from Judea .      hear what he be do , a large number of people come to he also from Jerusalem , from Idumea , from beyond the Jordan , and from the neighborhood of Tyre and Sidon .      he tell his disciple to have a boat ready for he because of the crowd , so that they would not crush he .      he have cure many and , as a result , those who have disease be press upon he to touch he .         and whenever unclean spirit see he they would fall down before he and shout , you be the Son of God .        he warn they sternly not to make he know .    the Mission of the Twelve .      he go up the mountain    and summon those whom he want and they come to he .       he appoint twelve [ whom he also name apostle ] that they might be with he    and he might send they forth to preach      and to have authority to drive out demon :       [ he appoint the twelve :] Simon , whom he name Peter ;      James , son of Zebedee , and John the brother of James , whom he name Boanerges , that is , son of thunder ;        Andrew , Philip , Bartholomew , Matthew , Thomas , James the son of Alphaeus ; Thaddeus , Simon the Cananean ,      and Judas Iscariot who betray he .

Jesus and Beelzebul .     summon they , he begin to speak to they in parable , how can Satan drive out Satan ?      if a kingdom be divide against itself , that kingdom can not stand .      and if a house be divide against itself , that house will not be able to stand .      and if Satan have rise up against himself and be divide , he can not stand ; that be the end of he .      but no one can enter a strong mans house to plunder his property unless he first tie up the strong man . then he can plunder his house .      amen , I say to you , all sin and all blasphemy that people utter will be forgive they .        but whoever blaspheme against the holy Spirit    will never have forgiveness , but be guilty of an everlasting sin .      for they have say , he have an unclean spirit .
