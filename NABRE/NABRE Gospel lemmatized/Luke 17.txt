b '   temptation to Sin .      he say to his disciple , thing that cause sin will inevitably occur , but woe to the person through whom they occur .      it would be well for he if a millstone be put around his neck and he be throw into the sea than for he to cause one of these little one to sin .      be on your guard !    if your brother sin , rebuke he ; and if he repent , forgive he .        and if he wrong you seven time in one day and return to you seven time say , I be sorry , you should forgive he .     say of Faith .     and the apostle say to the Lord , increase our faith .      the Lord reply , if you have faith the size of a mustard seed , you would say to [ this ] mulberry tree , be uproot and plant in the sea , and it would obey you .   attitude of a servant .        who among you would say to your servant who have just come in from plow or tend sheep in the field , come here immediately and take your place at table ?      would he not rather say to he , prepare something for I to eat . put on your apron and wait on I while I eat and drink . you may eat and drink when I be finish ?      be he grateful to that servant because he do what be command ?      so should it be with you . when you have do all you have be command , say , we be unprofitable servant ; we have do what we be oblige to do . the cleansing of ten leper .        as he continue his journey to Jerusalem ,    he travel through Samaria and Galilee .        as he be enter a village , ten leper meet [ he ] . they stand at a distance from he      and raise their voice , say , Jesus , Master ! have pity on we !        and when he see they , he say , go show yourself to the priest .    as they be go they be cleanse .        and one of they , realize he have be heal , return , glorify God in a loud voice ;      and he fall at the foot of Jesus and thank he . he be a Samaritan .      Jesus say in reply , ten be cleanse , be they not ? where be the other nine ?      have none but this foreigner return to give thank to God ?      then he say to he , stand up and go ; your faith have save you .     the coming of the Kingdom of God .      ask by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come , he say in reply , the coming of the kingdom of God can not be observe ,         and no one will announce , look , here it be , or , there it be .    for behold , the kingdom of God be among you .    the Day of the Son of Man .     then he say to his disciple , the day will come when you will long to see one of the day of the Son of Man , but you will not see it .      there will be those who will say to you , look , there he be , [ or ] look , here he be . do not go off , do not run in pursuit .        for just as lightning flash and light up the sky from one side to the other , so will the Son of Man be [ in his day ] .        but first he must suffer greatly and be reject by this generation .        as it be in the day of Noah ,    so it will be in the day of the Son of Man ;      they be eat and drink , marry and give in marriage up to the day that Noah enter the ark , and the flood come and destroy they all .       similarly , as it be in the day of Lot : they be eat , drink , buying , selling , planting , building ;      on the day when Lot leave Sodom , fire and brimstone rain from the sky to destroy they all .      so it will be on the day the Son of Man be reveal .       on that day , a person who be on the housetop and whose belonging be in the house must not go down to get they , and likewise a person in the field must not return to what be leave behind .        remember the wife of Lot .      whoever seek to preserve his life will lose it , but whoever lose it will save it .        I tell you , on that night there will be two people in one bed ; one will be take , the other leave .       and there will be two woman grind meal together ; one will be take , the other leave .     [   ]        they say to he in reply , where , Lord ? he say to they , where the body be , there also the vulture will gather .              '
