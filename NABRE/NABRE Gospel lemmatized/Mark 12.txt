b '   parable of the Tenants .      he begin to speak to they in parable .    a man plant a vineyard , put a hedge around it , dig a wine press , and build a tower . then he lease it to tenant farmer and leave on a journey .        at the proper time he send a servant to the tenant to obtain from they some of the produce of the vineyard .      but they seize he , beat he , and send he away empty - handed .      again he send they another servant . and that one they beat over the head and treat shamefully .      he send yet another whom they kill . so , too , many other ; some they beat , other they kill .      he have one other to send , a beloved son . he send he to they last of all , think , they will respect my son .      but those tenant say to one another , this be the heir . come , let we kill he , and the inheritance will be ours .      so they seize he and kill he , and throw he out of the vineyard .      what [ then ] will the owner of the vineyard do ? he will come , put the tenant to death , and give the vineyard to other .      have you not read this scripture passage :   the stone that the builder reject   have become the cornerstone ;   by the Lord have this be do ,   and it be wonderful in our eye ?     they be seek to arrest he , but they fear the crowd , for they realize that he have address the parable to they . so they leave he and go away .    pay taxis to the Emperor .      they send some Pharisees    and Herodians to he to ensnare he    in his speech .        they come and say to he , teacher , we know that you be a truthful man and that you be not concern with anyone opinion . you do not regard a person status but teach the way of God in accordance with the truth . be it lawful to pay the census tax to Caesar or not ? should we pay or should we not pay ?      know their hypocrisy he say to they , why be you test I ? bring I a denarius to look at .      they bring one to he and he say to they , whose image and inscription be this ? they reply to he , Caesars .      so Jesus say to they , Repay to Caesar what belong to Caesar and to God what belong to God . they be utterly amazed at he .   the question about the resurrection .        some Sadducees , who say there be no resurrection , come to he and put this question to he ,      say , Teacher , Moses write for we , if someone brother die , leave a wife but no child , his brother must take the wife and raise up descendant for his brother .        now there be seven brother . the first marry a woman and die , leave no descendant .      so the second marry she and die , leave no descendant , and the third likewise .      and the seven leave no descendant . last of all the woman also die .      at the resurrection [ when they arise ] whose wife will she be ? for all seven have be marry to she .      Jesus say to they , be you not mislead because you do not know the scripture or the power of God ?      when they rise from the dead , they neither marry nor be give in marriage , but they be like the angel in heaven .      as for the dead be raise , have you not read in the Book of Moses , in the passage about the bush , how God tell he , I be the God of Abraham , [ the ] God of Isaac , and [ the ] God of Jacob ?        he be not God of the dead but of the living . you be greatly mislead . the Greatest Commandment .        one of the scribe ,    when he come forward and hear they dispute and see how well he have answer they , ask he , which be the first of all the commandment ?      Jesus reply , the first be this : hear , o Israel ! the Lord our God be Lord alone !      you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart , with all your soul , with all your mind , and with all your strength .        the second be this : you shall love your neighbor as yourself . there be no other commandment great than these .        the scribe say to he , well say , teacher . you be right in say , he be one and there be no other than he .      and to love he with all your heart , with all your understanding , with all your strength , and to love your neighbor as yourself be worth more than all burn offering and sacrifice .        and when Jesus see that [ he ] answer with understanding , he say to he , you be not far from the kingdom of God . and no one dare to ask he any more question .   the question about Davids Son .        as Jesus be teach in the temple area he say ,    how do the scribe claim that the Messiah be the son of David ?      David himself , inspire by the holy Spirit , say : the Lord say to my lord , sit at my right hand   until I place your enemy under your foot .      David himself call he lord ; so how be he his son ? [ the ] great crowd hear this with delight . denunciation of the Scribes .        in the course of his teaching he say ,    beware of the scribe , who like to go around in long robe and accept greeting in the marketplace ,      seat of honor in synagogue , and place of honor at banquet .      they devour the house of widow and , as a pretext , recite lengthy prayer . they will receive a very severe condemnation . the Poor Widows Contribution .        he sit down opposite the treasury and observe how the crowd put money into the treasury .    many rich people put in large sum .      a poor widow also come and put in two small coin worth a few cent .      call his disciple to himself , he say to they , amen , I say to you , this poor widow put in more than all the other contributor to the treasury .      for they have all contribute from their surplus wealth , but she , from her poverty , have contribute all she have , her whole livelihood .
