b '   marriage and divorce .     he set out from there and go into the district of Judea [ and ] across the Jordan . again crowd gather around he and , as be his custom , he again teach they .       the Pharisees approach and ask , be it lawful for a husband to divorce his wife ? they be test he .        he say to they in reply , what do Moses command you ?      they reply , Moses permit he to write a bill of divorce and dismiss she .        but Jesus tell they , because of the hardness of your heart he write you this commandment .      but from the beginning of creation , God make they male and female .        for this reason a man shall leave his father and mother [ and be join to his wife ] ,        and the two shall become one flesh . so they be no long two but one flesh .      therefore what God have join together , no human being must separate .      in the house the disciple again question he about this .       he say to they , whoever divorce his wife and marry another commit adultery against she ;      and if she divorce her husband and marry another , she commit adultery .    Blessing of the Children .      and people be bring child to he that he might touch they , but the disciple rebuke they .        when Jesus see this he become indignant and say to they , let the child come to I ; do not prevent they , for the kingdom of God belong to such as these .      amen , I say to you , whoever do not accept the kingdom of God like a child    will not enter it .        then he embrace they and bless they , place his hand on they .    the Rich Man .      as he be set out on a journey , a man run up , kneel down before he , and ask he , good teacher , what must I do to inherit eternal life ?

Jesus , look at he , love he and say to he , you be lack in one thing . go , sell what you have , and give to [ the ] poor and you will have treasure in heaven ; then come , follow I .      at that statement his face fall , and he go away sad , for he have many possession .      Jesus look around and say to his disciple , how hard it be for those who have wealth to enter the kingdom of God !        the disciple be amazed at his word . so Jesus again say to they in reply , Children , how hard it be to enter the kingdom of God !      it be easy for a camel to pass through [ the ] eye of [ a ] needle than for one who be rich to enter the kingdom of God .      they be exceedingly astonish and say among themselves , then who can be save ?      Jesus look at they and say , for human being it be impossible , but not for God . all thing be possible for God .      Peter begin to say to he , we have give up everything and follow you .      Jesus say , amen , I say to you , there be no one who have give up house or brother or sister or mother or father or child or land for my sake and for the sake of the gospel      who will not receive a hundred time more now in this present age : house and brother and sister and mother and child and land , with persecution , and eternal life in the age to come .      but many that be first will be last , and [ the ] last will be first .     the Third Prediction of the passion .      they be on the way , go up to Jerusalem , and Jesus go ahead of they . they be amazed , and those who follow be afraid . take the twelve aside again , he begin to tell they what be go to happen to he .      behold , we be go up to Jerusalem , and the Son of Man will be hand over to the chief priest and the scribe , and they will condemn he to death and hand he over to the Gentiles      who will mock he , spit upon he , scourge he , and put he to death , but after three day he will rise .    ambition of James and John .      then James and John , the son of Zebedee , come to he and say to he , teacher , we want you to do for we whatever we ask of you .      he reply , what do you wish [ I ] to do for you ?      they answer he , Grant that in your glory we may sit one at your right and the other at your left .        Jesus say to they , you do not know what you be ask . can you drink the cup that I drink or be baptize with the baptism with which I be baptize ?      they say to he , we can . Jesus say to they , the cup that I drink , you will drink , and with the baptism with which I be baptize , you will be baptize ;      but to sit at my right or at my left be not mine to give but be for those for whom it have be prepare .      when the ten hear this , they become indignant at James and John .       Jesus summon they and say to they ,    you know that those who be recognize as ruler over the Gentiles lord it over they , and their great one make their authority over they feel .      but it shall not be so among you . rather , whoever wish to be great among you will be your servant ;      whoever wish to be first among you will be the slave of all .      for the Son of Man do not come to be serve but to serve and to give his life as a ransom for many . the Blind Bartimaeus .        they come to Jericho .    and as he be leave Jericho with his disciple and a sizable crowd , Bartimaeus , a blind man , the son of Timaeus , sit by the roadside beg .      on hear that it be Jesus of Nazareth , he begin to cry out and say , Jesus , son of David , have pity on I .      and many rebuke he , tell he to be silent . but he keep call out all the more , Son of David , have pity on I .      Jesus stop and say , call he . so they call the blind man , say to he , take courage ; get up , he be call you .      he throw aside his cloak , spring up , and come to Jesus .      Jesus say to he in reply , what do you want I to do for you ? the blind man reply to he , Master , I want to see .      Jesus tell he , go your way ; your faith have save you . immediately he receive his sight and follow he on the way .             '
