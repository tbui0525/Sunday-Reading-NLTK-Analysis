b '   pick Grain on the Sabbath .      at that time Jesus be go through a field of grain on the sabbath .    his disciple be hungry and begin to pick the head    of grain and eat they .        when the Pharisees see this , they say to he , see , your disciple be do what be unlawful to do on the sabbath .      he say to they ,    have you not read what David    do when he and his companion be hungry ,      how he go into the house of God and eat the bread of offering ,    which neither he nor his companion but only the priest could lawfully eat ?       or have you not read in the law that on the sabbath the priest serve in the temple violate the sabbath and be innocent ?        I say to you , something great than the temple be here .       if you know what this mean , I desire mercy , not sacrifice ,    you would not have condemn these innocent man .        for the Son of Man be Lord of the sabbath .    the Man with a Withered Hand .      move on from there , he go into their synagogue .      and behold , there be a man there who have a withered hand . they question he , be it lawful to cure on the sabbath ?    so that they might accuse he .       he say to they , which one of you who have a sheep that fall into a pit on the sabbath will not take hold of it and lift it out ?      how much more valuable a person be than a sheep . so it be lawful to do good on the sabbath .      then he say to the man , stretch out your hand . he stretch it out , and it be restore as sound as the other .      but the Pharisees    go out and take counsel against he to put he to death .   the chosen servant .        when Jesus realize this , he withdraw from that place . many [ people ] follow he , and he cure they all ,        but he warn they not to make he know .      this be to fulfill what have be speak through Isaiah the prophet :     behold , my servant whom I have choose ,    my beloved in whom I delight ; I shall place my spirit upon he ,   and he will proclaim justice to the Gentiles .   he will not contend    or cry out ,   nor will anyone hear his voice in the street .   a bruised reed he will not break ,   a smoldering wick he will not quench , until he bring justice to victory .    and in his name the Gentiles will hope .   Jesus and Beelzebul .         then they bring to he a demoniac who be blind and mute . he cure the mute person so that he could speak and see .        all the crowd be astounded , and say , could this perhaps be the Son of David ?        but when the Pharisees hear this , they say , this man drive out demon only by the power of Beelzebul , the prince of demon .       but he know what they be think and say to they ,    every kingdom divide against itself will be lay waste , and no town or house divide against itself will stand .      and if Satan drive out Satan , he be divide against himself ; how , then , will his kingdom stand ?      and if I drive out demon by Beelzebul , by whom do your own people    drive they out ? therefore they will be your judge .        but if it be by the Spirit of God that I drive out demon , then the kingdom of God have come upon you .       how can anyone enter a strong mans house and steal his property , unless he first tie up the strong man ? then he can plunder his house .        whoever be not with I be against I , and whoever do not gather with I scatter .       therefore , I say to you , every sin and blasphemy will be forgive people , but blasphemy against the Spirit    will not be forgive .      and whoever speak a word against the Son of Man will be forgive ; but whoever speak against the holy Spirit will not be forgive , either in this age or in the age to come .    a Tree and its fruit .      either declare    the tree good and its fruit be good , or declare the tree rotten and its fruit be rotten , for a tree be know by its fruit .        you brood of viper , how can you say good thing when you be evil ? for from the fullness of the heart the mouth speak .      a good person bring forth good out of a store of goodness , but an evil person bring forth evil out of a store of evil .        I tell you , on the day of judgment people will render an account for every careless word they speak .      by your word you will be acquit , and by your word you will be condemn . the demand for a Sign .        then some of the scribe and Pharisees say to he , Teacher ,    we wish to see a sign from you .        he say to they in reply , an evil and unfaithful    generation seek a sign , but no sign will be give it except the sign of Jonah the prophet .      just as Jonah be in the belly of the whale three day and three night ,    so will the Son of Man be in the heart of the earth three day and three night .       at the judgment , the man of Nineveh will arise with this generation and condemn it , because they repent at the preaching of Jonah ; and there be something great than Jonah here .      at the judgment the queen of the south will arise with this generation and condemn it , because she come from the end of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon ; and there be something great than Solomon here .   the Return of the Unclean Spirit .         when an unclean spirit go out of a person it roam through arid region search for rest but find none .      then it say , I will return to my home from which I come . but upon return , it find it empty , sweep clean , and put in order .      then it go and bring back with itself seven other spirit more evil than itself , and they move in and dwell there ; and the last condition of that person be bad than the first . thus it will be with this evil generation . the true Family of Jesus .         while he be still speak to the crowd , his mother and his brother appear outside , wish to speak with he .      [ someone tell he , your mother and your brother be stand outside , ask to speak with you . ]        but he say in reply to the one who tell he , who be my mother ? who be my brother ?      and stretch out his hand toward his disciple , he say , here be my mother and my brother .      for whoever do the will of my heavenly Father be my brother , and sister , and mother .
