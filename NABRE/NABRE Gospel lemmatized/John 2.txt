b '   the wedding at Cana .      on the third day there be a wedding    in Cana    in Galilee , and the mother of Jesus be there .        Jesus and his disciple be also invite to the wedding .      when the wine run short , the mother of Jesus say to he , they have no wine .       [ and ] Jesus say to she , Woman , how do your concern affect I ? my hour have not yet come .        his mother say to the server , do whatever he tell you .         now there be six stone water jar there for jewish ceremonial washing ,    each hold twenty to thirty gallon .      Jesus tell they , fill the jar with water . so they fill they to the brim .      then he tell they , draw some out now and take it to the headwaiter .    so they take it .      and when the headwaiter taste the water that have become wine , without know where it come from ( although the server who have draw the water know ) , the headwaiter call the bridegroom      and say to he , everyone serve good wine first , and then when people have drink freely , an inferior one ; but you have keep the good wine until now .      Jesus do this as the beginning of his sign    in Cana in Galilee and so reveal his glory , and his disciple begin to believe in he .       after this , he and his mother , [ his ] brother , and his disciple go down to Capernaum and stay there only a few day .     cleanse of the Temple .      since the Passover    of the Jews be near ,    Jesus go up to Jerusalem .       he find in the temple area those who sell oxen , sheep , and dove ,    as well as the money - changer seat there .        he make a whip out of cord and drive they all out of the temple area , with the sheep and oxen , and spill the coin of the money - changer and overturn their table ,      and to those who sell dove he say , take these out of here , and stop make my Fathers house a marketplace .         his disciple recall the word of scripture ,    Zeal for your house will consume I .      at this the Jews answer and say to he , what sign can you show we for do this ?        Jesus answer and say to they ,     destroy this temple and in three day I will raise it up .      the Jews say , this temple have be under construction for forty - six year ,    and you will raise it up in three day ?      but he be speak about the temple of his body .      therefore , when he be raise from the dead , his disciple remember that he have say this , and they come to believe the scripture and the word Jesus have speak .      while he be in Jerusalem for the feast of Passover , many begin to believe in his name when they see the sign he be do .        but Jesus would not trust himself to they because he know they all ,      and do not need anyone to testify about human nature . he himself understand it well .
