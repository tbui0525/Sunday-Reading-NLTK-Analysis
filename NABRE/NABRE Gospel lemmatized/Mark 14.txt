Jesus say , let she alone . why do you make trouble for she ? she have do a good thing for I .      the poor you will always have with you , and whenever you wish you can do good to they , but you will not always have I .      she have do what she could . she have anticipate anoint my body for burial .      amen , I say to you , wherever the gospel be proclaim to the whole world , what she have do will be tell in memory of she .    the betrayal by Judas .      then Judas Iscariot , one of the twelve , go off to the chief priest to hand he over to they .      when they hear he they be pleased and promise to pay he money . then he look for an opportunity to hand he over .    preparation for the Passover .      on the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread , when they sacrifice the Passover lamb ,    his disciple say to he , where do you want we to go and prepare for you to eat the Passover ?      he send two of his disciple and say to they , go into the city and a man will meet you , carry a jar of water .    follow he .      wherever he enter , say to the master of the house , the teacher say , where be my guest room where I may eat the Passover with my disciple ?      then he will show you a large upper room furnish and ready . make the preparation for we there .      the disciple then go off , enter the city , and find it just as he have tell they ; and they prepare the Passover .    the Betrayer .      when it be evening , he come with the twelve .       and as they recline at table and be eat , Jesus say , amen , I say to you , one of you will betray I , one who be eat with I .      they begin to be distressed and to say to he , one by one , surely it be not I ?      he say to they , one of the Twelve , the one who dip with I into the dish .      for the Son of Man indeed go , as it be write of he ,    but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man be betray . it would be well for that man if he have never be bear .    the Lords Supper .      while they be eat ,    he take bread , say the blessing , break it , and give it to they , and say , take it ; this be my body .      then he take a cup , give thank , and give it to they , and they all drink from it .      he say to they , this be my blood of the covenant , which will be shed    for many .      amen , I say to you , I shall not drink again the fruit of the vine until the day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God .      then , after singe a hymn ,    they go out to the Mount of Olives .   Peters Denial Foretold .        then Jesus say to they , all of you will have your faith shake , for it be write : I will strike the shepherd ,   and the sheep will be disperse .      but after I have be raise up , I shall go before you to Galilee .      Peter say to he , even though all should have their faith shake , mine will not be .      then Jesus say to he , amen , I say to you , this very night before the cock crow twice you will deny I three time .      but he vehemently reply , even though I should have to die with you , I will not deny you . and they all speak similarly .    the Agony in the Garden .      then they come to a place name Gethsemane ,    and he say to his disciple , sit here while I pray .        he take with he Peter , James , and John , and begin to be troubled and distressed .      then he say to they , my soul be sorrowful even to death . remain here and keep watch .      he advance a little and fall to the ground and pray that if it be possible the hour might pass by he ;      he say , Abba , Father ,    all thing be possible to you . take this cup away from I , but not what I will but what you will .      when he return he find they asleep . he say to Peter , Simon , be you asleep ? could you not keep watch for one hour ?       watch and pray that you may not undergo the test .    the spirit be willing but the flesh be weak .      withdraw again , he pray , say the same thing .      then he return once more and find they asleep , for they could not keep their eye open and do not know what to answer he .      he return a third time and say to they , be you still sleep and take your rest ? it be enough . the hour have come . behold , the Son of Man be to be hand over to sinner .      get up , let we go . see , my betrayer be at hand .    the betrayal and arrest of Jesus .      then , while he be still speak , Judas , one of the twelve , arrive , accompany by a crowd with sword and club who have come from the chief priest , the scribe , and the elder .      his betrayer have arrange a signal with they , say , the man I shall kiss be the one ; arrest he and lead he away securely .      he come and immediately go over to he and say , Rabbi . and he kiss he .      at this they lay hand on he and arrest he .      one of the bystander draw his sword , strike the high priest servant , and cut off his ear .      Jesus say to they in reply , have you come out as against a robber , with sword and club , to seize I ?      day after day I be with you teach in the temple area , yet you do not arrest I ; but that the scripture may be fulfil .      and they all leave he and flee .      now a young man follow he wear nothing but a linen cloth about his body . they seize he ,      but he leave the cloth behind and run off naked .    Jesus before the Sanhedrin .       they lead Jesus away to the high priest , and all the chief priest and the elder and the scribe come together .      Peter follow he at a distance into the high priest courtyard and be seat with the guard , warm himself at the fire .      the chief priest and the entire Sanhedrin keep try to obtain testimony against Jesus in order to put he to death , but they find none .      many give false witness against he , but their testimony do not agree .       some take the stand and testify falsely against he , allege ,      we hear he say , I will destroy this temple make with hand and within three day I will build another not make with hand .        even so their testimony do not agree .      the high priest rise before the assembly and question Jesus , say , have you no answer ? what be these man testify against you ?       but he be silent and answer nothing . again the high priest ask he and say to he , be you the Messiah , the son of the bless one ?      then Jesus answer , I be ; and you will see the Son of Man   seat at the right hand of the Power   and come with the cloud of heaven .      at that the high priest tear his garment and say , what far need have we of witness ?      you have hear the blasphemy . what do you think ? they all condemn he as deserve to die .      some begin to spit on he . they blindfold he and strike he and say to he , Prophesy ! and the guard greet he with blow .     Peters Denial of Jesus .      while Peter be below in the courtyard , one of the high priest maid come along .      see Peter warm himself , she look intently at he and say , you too be with the Nazarene , Jesus .       but he deny it say , I neither know nor understand what you be talk about . so he go out into the outer court . [ then the cock crow . ]      the maid see he and begin again to say to the bystander , this man be one of they .      once again he deny it . a little later the bystander say to Peter once more , surely you be one of they ; for you too be a Galilean .      he begin to curse and to swear , I do not know this man about whom you be talk .      and immediately a cock crow a second time . then Peter remember the word that Jesus have say to he , before the cock crow twice you will deny I three time . he break down and weep .
