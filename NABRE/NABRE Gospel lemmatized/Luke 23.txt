Pilate ask he , be you the king of the Jews ? he say to he in reply , you say so .        Pilate then address the chief priest and the crowd , I find this man not guilty .      but they be adamant and say , he be incite the people with his teaching throughout all Judea , from Galilee where he begin even to here .     Jesus before Herod .      on hear this Pilate ask if the man be a Galilean ;      and upon learn that he be under Herods jurisdiction , he send he to Herod who be in Jerusalem at that time .        Herod be very glad to see Jesus ; he have be want to see he for a long time , for he have hear about he and have be hope to see he perform some sign .        he question he at length , but he give he no answer .        the chief priest and scribe , meanwhile , stand by accuse he harshly .        [ even ] Herod and his soldier treat he contemptuously and mock he , and after clothe he in resplendent garb , he send he back to Pilate .        Herod and Pilate become friend that very day , even though they have be enemy formerly .      Pilate then summon the chief priest , the ruler , and the people      and say to they , you bring this man to I and accuse he of incite the people to revolt . I have conduct my investigation in your presence and have not find this man guilty of the charge you have bring against he ,        nor do Herod , for he send he back to we . so no capital crime have be commit by he .       therefore I shall have he flog and then release he .     [   ]   the Sentence of Death .        but all together they shout out , away with this man ! release Barabbas to we .      ( now Barabbas have be imprison for a rebellion that have take place in the city and for murder . )      again Pilate address they , still wish to release Jesus ,      but they continue their shouting , crucify he ! crucify he !      Pilate address they a third time , what evil have this man do ? I find he guilty of no capital crime . therefore I shall have he flog and then release he .      with loud shout , however , they persist in call for his crucifixion , and their voice prevail .      the verdict of Pilate be that their demand should be grant .      so he release the man who have be imprison for rebellion and murder , for whom they ask , and he hand Jesus over to they to deal with as they wish . the way of the Cross .         as they lead he away they take hold of a certain Simon , a Cyrenian , who be come in from the country ; and after lay the cross on he , they make he carry it behind Jesus .      a large crowd of people follow Jesus , include many woman who mourn and lament he .       Jesus turn to they and say , daughter of Jerusalem , do not weep for I ; weep instead for yourself and for your child ,      for indeed , the day be come when people will say , bless be the barren , the womb that never bear and the breast that never nurse .      at that time people will say to the mountain , fall upon we ! and to the hill , cover we !        for if these thing be do when the wood be green what will happen when it be dry ?      now two other , both criminal , be lead away with he to be execute . the crucifixion .        when they come to the place call the Skull , they crucify he and the criminal there , one on his right , the other on his left .        [ then Jesus say , Father , forgive they , they know not what they do . ]    they divide his garment by cast lot .        the people stand by and watch ; the ruler , meanwhile , sneer at he and say ,    he save other , let he save himself if he be the choose one , the Messiah of God .        even the soldier jeer at he . as they approach to offer he wine        they call out , if you be king of the Jews , save yourself .      above he there be an inscription that read , this be the king of the Jews .      now one of the criminal hang there revile Jesus , say , be you not the Messiah ? save yourself and we .      the other , however , rebuke he , say in reply , have you no fear of God , for you be subject to the same condemnation ?      and indeed , we have be condemn justly , for the sentence we receive correspond to our crime , but this man have do nothing criminal .        then he say , Jesus , remember I when you come into your kingdom .        he reply to he , amen , I say to you , today you will be with I in Paradise .   the death of Jesus .         it be now about noon    and darkness come over the whole land until three in the afternoon      because of an eclipse of the sun . then the veil of the temple be tear down the middle .        Jesus cry out in a loud voice , Father , into your hand I commend my spirit ; and when he have say this he breathe his last .        the centurion who witness what have happen glorify God and say , this man be innocent    beyond doubt .      when all the people who have gather for this spectacle see what have happen , they return home beat their breast ;        but all his acquaintance stand at a distance , include the woman who have follow he from Galilee and see these event .   the Burial of Jesus .        now there be a virtuous and righteous man name Joseph who , though he be a member of the council ,      have not consent to their plan of action . he come from the jewish town of Arimathea and be await the kingdom of God .        he go to Pilate and ask for the body of Jesus .      after he have take the body down , he wrap it in a linen cloth and lay he in a rock - hew tomb in which no one have yet be bury .        it be the day of preparation , and the sabbath be about to begin .      the woman who have come from Galilee with he follow behind , and when they have see the tomb and the way in which his body be lay in it ,        they return and prepare spice and perfumed oil . then they rest on the sabbath accord to the commandment .
