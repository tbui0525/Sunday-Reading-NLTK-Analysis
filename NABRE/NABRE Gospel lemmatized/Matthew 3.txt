John wear clothing make of camel hair and have a leather belt around his waist . his food be locust and wild honey .      at that time Jerusalem , all Judea , and the whole region around the Jordan be go out to he      and be be baptize by he in the Jordan River as they acknowledge their sin .      when he see many of the Pharisees and Sadducees    come to his baptism , he say to they , you brood of viper ! who warn you to flee from the come wrath ?        produce good fruit as evidence of your repentance .      and do not presume to say to yourself , we have Abraham as our father . for I tell you , God can raise up child to Abraham from these stone .        even now the ax lie at the root of the tree . therefore every tree that do not bear good fruit will be cut down and throw into the fire .       I be baptize you with water , for repentance , but the one who be come after I be mighty than i. I be not worthy to carry his sandal . he will baptize you with the holy Spirit and fire .          his winnowing fan be in his hand . he will clear his threshing floor and gather his wheat into his barn , but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire . the Baptism of Jesus .         then Jesus come from Galilee to John at the Jordan to be baptize by he .       John try to prevent he , say , I need to be baptize by you , and yet you be come to I ?      Jesus say to he in reply , allow it now , for thus it be fitting for we to fulfill all righteousness . then he allow he .        after Jesus be baptize , he come up from the water and behold , the heaven be open [ for he ] , and he see the Spirit of God descend like a dove [ and ] come upon he .      and a voice come from the heavens , say , this be my beloved Son ,    with whom I be well pleased .
