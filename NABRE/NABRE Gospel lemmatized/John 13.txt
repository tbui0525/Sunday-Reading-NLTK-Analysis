b '   the Washing of the Disciples Feet .      before the feast of Passover ,    Jesus know that his hour have come to pass from this world to the Father . he love his own in the world and he love they to the end .        the devil have already induce    Judas , son of Simon the Iscariot , to hand he over . so , during supper ,        fully aware that the Father have put everything into his power and that he have come from God and be return to God ,        he rise from supper and take off his outer garment . he take a towel and tie it around his waist .       then he pour water into a basin and begin to wash the disciple foot    and dry they with the towel around his waist .      he come to Simon Peter , who say to he , Master , be you go to wash my foot ?      Jesus answer and say to he , what I be do , you do not understand now , but you will understand later .      Peter say to he , you will never wash my foot . Jesus answer he , unless I wash you , you will have no inheritance with I .        Simon Peter say to he , Master , then not only my foot , but my hand and head as well .      Jesus say to he , whoever have bathe    have no need except to have his foot wash , for he be clean all over ; so you be clean , but not all .        for he know who would betray he ; for this reason , he say , not all of you be clean .      so when he have wash their foot [ and ] put his garment back on and recline at table again , he say to they , do you realize what I have do for you ?      you call I teacher and master , and rightly so , for indeed I be .        if I , therefore , the master and teacher , have wash your foot , you ought to wash one another foot .      I have give you a model to follow , so that as I have do for you , you should also do .        amen , amen , I say to you , no slave be great than his master nor any messenger    great than the one who send he .        if you understand this , bless be you if you do it .      I be not speak of all of you . I know those whom I have choose . but so that the scripture might be fulfil , the one who eat my food have raise his heel against I .        from now on I be tell you before it happen , so that when it happen you may believe that I be .      amen , amen , I say to you , whoever receive the one I send receive I , and whoever receive I receive the one who send I .   announcement of Judass Betrayal .        when he have say this , Jesus be deeply troubled and testify , amen , amen , I say to you , one of you will betray I .      the disciple look at one another , at a loss as to whom he mean .      one of his disciple , the one whom Jesus love ,    be recline at Jesus side .        so Simon Peter nod to he to find out whom he mean .      he lean back against Jesus chest and say to he , Master , who be it ?        Jesus answer , it be the one to whom I hand the morsel    after I have dip it . so he dip the morsel and [ take it and ] hand it to Judas , son of Simon the Iscariot .      after he take the morsel , Satan enter he . so Jesus say to he , what you be go to do , do quickly .        [ now ] none of those recline at table realize why he say this to he .      some think that since Judas keep the money bag , Jesus have tell he , buy what we need for the feast , or to give something to the poor .        so he take the morsel and leave at once . and it be night .    the New Commandment .      when he have leave , Jesus say ,    now be the Son of Man glorify , and God be glorify in he .      [ if God be glorify in he , ] God will also glorify he in himself , and he will glorify he at once .        my child , I will be with you only a little while long . you will look for I , and as I tell the Jews , where I go you can not come , so now I say it to you .        I give you a new commandment :    love one another . as I have love you , so you also should love one another .        this be how all will know that you be my disciple , if you have love for one another .    Peters Denial predict .     Simon Peter say to he , Master , where be you go ? Jesus answer [ he ] , where I be go , you can not follow I now , though you will follow later .        Peter say to he , Master , why can not I follow you now ? I will lay down my life for you .      Jesus answer , will you lay down your life for I ? amen , amen , I say to you , the cock will not crow before you deny I three time .              '
