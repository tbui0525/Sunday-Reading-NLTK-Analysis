b '   the Leaven of the Pharisees .      meanwhile , so many people be crowd together that they be trample one another underfoot .    he begin to speak , first to his disciple , beware of the leaven\xe2\x80\x94that be , the hypocrisy\xe2\x80\x94of the Pharisees . courage under Persecution .         there be nothing conceal that will not be reveal , nor secret that will not be know .        therefore whatever you have say in the darkness will be hear in the light , and what you have whisper behind close door will be proclaim on the housetop .      I tell you , my friend , do not be afraid of those who kill the body but after that can do no more .      I shall show you whom to fear . be afraid of the one who after killing have the power to cast into Gehenna ;    yes , I tell you , be afraid of that one .      be not five sparrow sell for two small coin ?    yet not one of they have escape the notice of God .      even the hair of your head have all be count . do not be afraid . you be worth more than many sparrow .        I tell you , everyone who acknowledge I before other the Son of Man will acknowledge before the angel of God .      but whoever deny I before other will be deny before the angel of God .   saying about the Holy Spirit .        everyone who speak a word against the Son of Man will be forgive , but the one who blaspheme against the holy Spirit will not be forgive .        when they take you before synagogue and before ruler and authority ,    do not worry about how or what your defense will be or about what you be to say .      for the holy Spirit will teach you at that moment what you should say .    say against Greed .      someone in the crowd say to he , teacher , tell my brother to share the inheritance with I .      he reply to he , Friend , who appoint I as your judge and arbitrator ?        then he say to the crowd , take care to guard against all greed , for though one may be rich , one life do not consist of possession .     parable of the Rich Fool .     then he tell they a parable . there be a rich man whose land produce a bountiful harvest .      he ask himself , what shall I do , for I do not have space to store my harvest ?      and he say , this be what I shall do : I shall tear down my barn and build large one . there I shall store all my grain and other good       and I shall say to myself , now as for you , you have so many good thing store up for many year , rest , eat , drink , be merry !        but God say to he , you fool , this night your life will be demand of you ; and the thing you have prepare , to whom will they belong ?      thus will it be for the one who store up treasure for himself but be not rich in what matter to God .     dependence on God .      he say to [ his ] disciple , therefore I tell you , do not worry about your life and what you will eat , or about your body and what you will wear .      for life be more than food and the body more than clothing .      notice the raven : they do not sow or reap ; they have neither storehouse nor barn , yet God feed they . how much more important be you than bird !        can any of you by worry add a moment to your life - span ?      if even the small thing be beyond your control , why be you anxious about the rest ?      notice how the flower grow . they do not toil or spin . but I tell you , not even Solomon in all his splendor be dress like one of they .        if God so clothe the grass in the field that grow today and be throw into the oven tomorrow , will he not much more provide for you , o you of little faith ?      as for you , do not seek what you be to eat and what you be to drink , and do not worry anymore .      all the nation of the world seek for these thing , and your Father know that you need they .      instead , seek his kingdom , and these other thing will be give you besides .      do not be afraid any long , little flock , for your Father be pleased to give you the kingdom .        sell your belonging and give alm . provide money bag for yourself that do not wear out , an inexhaustible treasure in heaven that no thief can reach nor moth destroy .        for where your treasure be , there also will your heart be . vigilant and faithful Servants .         Gird your loin and light your lamp      and be like servant who await their master return from a wedding , ready to open immediately when he come and knock .        bless be those servant whom the master find vigilant on his arrival . amen , I say to you , he will gird himself , have they recline at table , and proceed to wait on they .      and should he come in the second or third watch and find they prepared in this way , bless be those servant .       be sure of this : if the master of the house have know the hour when the thief be come , he would not have let his house be break into .      you also must be prepare , for at an hour you do not expect , the Son of Man will come .     then Peter say , Lord , be this parable mean for we or for everyone ?      and the Lord reply , who , then , be the faithful and prudent steward whom the master will put in charge of his servant to distribute [ the ] food allowance at the proper time ?      bless be that servant whom his master on arrival find do so .      truly , I say to you , he will put he in charge of all his property .      but if that servant say to himself , my master be delay in come ,    and begin to beat the manservant and the maidservant , to eat and drink and get drunk ,      then that servant master will come on an unexpected day and at an unknown hour and will punish he severely and assign he a place with the unfaithful .      that servant who know his master will but do not make preparation nor act in accord with his will shall be beat severely ;        and the servant who be ignorant of his master will but act in a way deserving of a severe beating shall be beat only lightly . much will be require of the person entrust with much , and still more will be demand of the person entrust with more . Jesus : a Cause of Division .        I have come to set the earth on fire , and how I wish it be already blaze !       there be a baptism with which I must be baptize , and how great be my anguish until it be accomplish !        do you think that I have come to establish peace on the earth ?    no , I tell you , but rather division .        from now on a household of five will be divide , three against two and two against three ;      a father will be divide against his son and a son against his father , a mother against her daughter and a daughter against her mother , a mother - in - law against her daughter - in - law and a daughter - in - law against her mother - in - law .   sign of the Times .        he also say to the crowd , when you see [ a ] cloud rise in the west you say immediately that it be go to rain\xe2\x80\x94and so it do ;      and when you notice that the wind be blow from the south you say that it be go to be hot\xe2\x80\x94and so it be .      you hypocrite ! you know how to interpret the appearance of the earth and the sky ; why do you not know how to interpret the present time ? settlement with an opponent .        why do you not judge for yourself what be right ?      if you be to go with your opponent before a magistrate , make an effort to settle the matter on the way ; otherwise your opponent will turn you over to the judge , and the judge hand you over to the constable , and the constable throw you into prison .      I say to you , you will not be release until you have pay the last penny .              '
