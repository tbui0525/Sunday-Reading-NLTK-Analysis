b '   teach about Almsgiving .      [ but ] take care not to perform righteous deed in order that people may see they ;    otherwise , you will have no recompense from your heavenly Father .      when you give alm , do not blow a trumpet before you , as the hypocrite    do in the synagogue and in the street to win the praise of other . amen , I say to you , they have receive their reward .        but when you give alm , do not let your left hand know what your right be do ,      so that your almsgiving may be secret . and your Father who see in secret will repay you .    teach about Prayer .     when you pray , do not be like the hypocrite , who love to stand and pray in the synagogue and on street corner so that other may see they . amen , I say to you , they have receive their reward .      but when you pray , go to your inner room , close the door , and pray to your Father in secret . and your Father who see in secret will repay you .       in pray , do not babble like the pagan , who think that they will be hear because of their many word .        do not be like they . your Father know what you need before you ask he .    the Lords Prayer .      this be how you be to pray :   our Father in heaven ,    hallow be your name ,    your kingdom come ,    your will be do ,   on earth as in heaven .       give we today our daily bread ;    and forgive we our debt ,    as we forgive our debtor ;     and do not subject we to the final test ,    but deliver we from the evil one .       if you forgive other their transgression , your heavenly Father will forgive you .        but if you do not forgive other , neither will your Father forgive your transgression .     teach about fast .     when you fast ,    do not look gloomy like the hypocrite . they neglect their appearance , so that they may appear to other to be fast . amen , I say to you , they have receive their reward .      but when you fast , anoint your head and wash your face ,      so that you may not appear to other to be fast , except to your Father who be hide . and your Father who see what be hide will repay you .    Treasure in Heaven .      do not store up for yourself treasure on earth , where moth and decay destroy , and thief break in and steal .        but store up treasure in heaven , where neither moth nor decay destroy , nor thief break in and steal .      for where your treasure be , there also will your heart be .   the Light of the body .        the lamp of the body be the eye . if your eye be sound , your whole body will be fill with light ;      but if your eye be bad , your whole body will be in darkness . and if the light in you be darkness , how great will the darkness be .     God and Money .      no one can serve two master .    he will either hate one and love the other , or be devoted to one and despise the other . you can not serve God and mammon . dependence on God .         therefore I tell you , do not worry about your life , what you will eat [ or drink ] , or about your body , what you will wear . be not life more than food and the body more than clothing ?      look at the bird in the sky ; they do not sow or reap , they gather nothing into barn , yet your heavenly Father feed they . be not you more important than they ?        can any of you by worry add a single moment to your life - span ?        why be you anxious about clothe ? learn from the way the wild flower grow . they do not work or spin .      but I tell you that not even Solomon in all his splendor be clothe like one of they .       if God so clothe the grass of the field , which grow today and be throw into the oven tomorrow , will he not much more provide for you , o you of little faith ?      so do not worry and say , what be we to eat ? or what be we to drink ? or what be we to wear ?      all these thing the pagans seek . your heavenly Father know that you need they all .      but seek first the kingdom [ of God ] and his righteousness ,    and all these thing will be give you besides .      do not worry about tomorrow ; tomorrow will take care of itself . sufficient for a day be its own evil .
