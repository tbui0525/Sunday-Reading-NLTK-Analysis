b ' the Authority of Jesus question .      one day as he be teach the people in the temple area and proclaim the good news , the chief priest and scribe , together with the elder , approach he      and say to he , tell we , by what authority be you do these thing ? or who be the one who give you this authority ?        he say to they in reply , I shall ask you a question . tell I ,      be Johns baptism of heavenly or of human origin ?        they discuss this among themselves , and say , if we say , of heavenly origin , he will say , why do you not believe he ?        but if we say , of human origin , then all the people will stone we , for they be convinced that John be a prophet .      so they answer that they do not know from where it come .      then Jesus say to they , neither shall I tell you by what authority I do these thing . the parable of the Tenant Farmers .         then he proceed to tell the people this parable . [ a ] man plant a vineyard , lease it to tenant farmer , and then go on a journey for a long time .        at harvest time he send a servant    to the tenant farmer to receive some of the produce of the vineyard . but they beat the servant and send he away empty - handed .      so he proceed to send another servant , but he also they beat and insult and send away empty - handed .      then he proceed to send a third , but this one too they wound and throw out .      the owner of the vineyard say , what shall I do ? I shall send my beloved son ; maybe they will respect he .        but when the tenant farmer see he they say to one another , this be the heir . let we kill he that the inheritance may become ours .      so they throw he out of the vineyard and kill he .    what will the owner of the vineyard do to they ?      he will come and put those tenant farmer to death and turn over the vineyard to other . when the people hear this , they exclaim , let it not be so !      but he look at they and ask , what then do this scripture passage mean : the stone which the builder reject   have become the cornerstone ?      everyone who fall on that stone will be dash to piece ; and it will crush anyone on whom it fall .      the scribe and chief priest seek to lay their hand on he at that very hour , but they fear the people , for they know that he have address this parable to they .   pay taxis to the Emperor .         they watch he closely and send agent pretend to be righteous who be to trap he in speech ,    in order to hand he over to the authority and power of the governor .      they pose this question to he , teacher , we know that what you say and teach be correct , and you show no partiality , but teach the way of God in accordance with the truth .        be it lawful for we to pay tribute to Caesar or not ?        recognize their craftiness he say to they ,      show I a denarius ;    whose image and name do it bear ? they reply , Caesars .      so he say to they , then repay to Caesar what belong to Caesar and to God what belong to God .        they be unable to trap he by something he might say before the people , and so amazed be they at his reply that they fall silent . the question about the resurrection .        some Sadducees ,    those who deny that there be a resurrection , come forward and put this question to he ,         say , Teacher , Moses write for we , if someone brother die leave a wife but no child , his brother must take the wife and raise up descendant for his brother .        now there be seven brother ; the first marry a woman but die childless .      then the second      and the third marry she , and likewise all the seven die childless .      finally the woman also die .      now at the resurrection whose wife will that woman be ? for all seven have be marry to she .      Jesus say to they , the child of this age marry and be give in marriage ;      but those who be deem worthy to attain to the come age and to the resurrection of the dead neither marry nor be give in marriage .      they can no long die , for they be like angel ; and they be the child of God because they be the one who will rise .        that the dead will rise even Moses make known in the passage about the bush , when he call Lord the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob ;        and he be not God of the dead , but of the living , for to he all be alive .        some of the scribe say in reply , teacher , you have answer well .      and they no long dare to ask he anything .   the question about Davids Son .         then he say to they , how do they claim that the Messiah be the Son of David ?      for David himself in the Book of Psalms say :   the Lord say to my lord , sit at my right hand    till I make your enemy your footstool .     now if David call he lord , how can he be his son ? denunciation of the Scribes .        then , within the hearing of all the people , he say to [ his ] disciple ,      be on guard against the scribe , who like to go around in long robe and love greeting in marketplace , seat of honor in synagogue , and place of honor at banquet .        they devour the house of widow and , as a pretext , recite lengthy prayer . they will receive a very severe condemnation .
