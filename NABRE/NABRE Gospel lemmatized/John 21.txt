b '    the appearance to the Seven Disciples .      after this , Jesus reveal himself again to his disciple at the Sea of Tiberias . he reveal himself in this way .        together be Simon Peter , Thomas call Didymus , Nathanael from Cana in Galilee , Zebedees son ,    and two other of his disciple .       Simon Peter say to they , I be go fish . they say to he , we also will come with you . so they go out and get into the boat , but that night they catch nothing .        when it be already dawn , Jesus be stand on the shore ; but the disciple do not realize that it be Jesus .        Jesus say to they , Children , have you catch anything to eat ? they answer he , no .        so he say to they , cast the net over the right side of the boat and you will find something . so they cast it , and be not able to pull it in because of the number of fish .      so the disciple whom Jesus love say to Peter , it be the Lord . when Simon Peter hear that it be the Lord , he tuck in his garment , for he be lightly clothe , and jump into the sea .      the other disciple come in the boat , for they be not far from shore , only about a hundred yard , drag the net with the fish .        when they climb out on shore , they see a charcoal fire with fish on it and bread .      Jesus say to they , bring some of the fish you just catch .      so Simon Peter go over and drag the net ashore full of one hundred fifty - three    large fish . even though there be so many , the net be not tear .        Jesus say to they , come , have breakfast . and none of the disciple dare to ask he ,    who be you ? because they realize it be the Lord .      Jesus come over and take the bread and give it to they , and in like manner the fish .         this be now the third time    Jesus be reveal to his disciple after be raise from the dead . Jesus and Peter .        when they have finish breakfast , Jesus say to Simon Peter ,    Simon , son of John , do you love I more than these ?    he say to he , yes , Lord , you know that I love you . he say to he , feed my lamb .      he then say to he a second time , Simon , son of John , do you love I ? he say to he , yes , Lord , you know that I love you . he say to he , tend my sheep .      he say to he the third time , Simon , son of John , do you love I ? Peter be distressed that he have say to he a third time , do you love I ? and he say to he , Lord , you know everything ; you know that I love you . [ Jesus ] say to he , feed my sheep .         amen , amen , I say to you ,    when you be young , you use to dress yourself and go where you want ; but when you grow old , you will stretch out your hand , and someone else will dress you and lead you where you do not want to go .      he say this signifying by what kind of death he would glorify God . and when he have say this , he say to he , follow I .     the Beloved Disciple .     Peter turn and see the disciple follow whom Jesus love , the one who have also recline upon his chest during the supper and have say , Master , who be the one who will betray you ?        when Peter see he , he say to Jesus , Lord , what about he ?      Jesus say to he , what if I want he to remain until I come ?    what concern be it of yours ? you follow I .         so the word spread among the brother that that disciple would not die . but Jesus have not tell he that he would not die , just what if I want he to remain until I come ? [ what concern be it of yours ? ]    Conclusion .     it be this disciple who testify to these thing and have write they ,    and we know that his testimony be true .        there be also many other thing that Jesus do , but if these be to be describe individually , I do not think the whole world would contain the book that would be write .
