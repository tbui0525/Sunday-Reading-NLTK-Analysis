b '   the Lords Prayer .       he be pray in a certain place , and when he have finish , one of his disciple say to he , Lord , teach we to pray just as John teach his disciple .         he say to they , when you pray , say : Father , hallow be your name ,   your kingdom come .    give we each day our daily bread     and forgive we our sin   for we ourselves forgive everyone in debt to we ,   and do not subject we to the final test . further teaching on Prayer .        and he say to they , suppose one of you have a friend to whom he go at midnight and say , Friend , lend I three loaf of bread ,      for a friend of mine have arrive at my house from a journey and I have nothing to offer he ,      and he say in reply from within , do not bother I ; the door have already be lock and my child and I be already in bed . I can not get up to give you anything .      I tell you , if he do not get up to give he the loaf because of their friendship , he will get up to give he whatever he need because of his persistence . the Answer to Prayer .        and I tell you , ask and you will receive ; seek and you will find ; knock and the door will be open to you .        for everyone who ask , receive ; and the one who seek , find ; and to the one who knock , the door will be open .      what father among you would hand his son a snake when he ask for a fish ?      or hand he a scorpion when he ask for an egg ?      if you then , who be wicked , know how to give good gift to your child , how much more will the Father in heaven give the holy Spirit    to those who ask he ? Jesus and Beelzebul .        he be drive out a demon [ that be ] mute , and when the demon have go out , the mute person speak and the crowd be amazed .      some of they say , by the power of Beelzebul , the prince of demon , he drive out demon .        other , to test he , ask he for a sign from heaven .        but he know their thought and say to they , every kingdom divide against itself will be lay waste and house will fall against house .      and if Satan be divide against himself , how will his kingdom stand ? for you say that it be by Beelzebul that I drive out demon .      if I , then , drive out demon by Beelzebul , by whom do your own people    drive they out ? therefore they will be your judge .      but if it be by the finger of God that [ i ] drive out demon , then the kingdom of God have come upon you .        when a strong man fully armed guard his palace , his possession be safe .      but when one strong    than he attack and overcome he , he take away the armor on which he rely and distribute the spoil .      whoever be not with I be against I , and whoever do not gather with I scatter .   the Return of the Unclean Spirit .        when an unclean spirit go out of someone , it roam through arid region search for rest but , find none , it say , I shall return to my home from which I come .      but upon return , it find it sweep clean and put in order .      then it go and bring back seven other spirit more wicked than itself who move in and dwell there , and the last condition of that person be bad than the first .   True Blessedness .        while he be speak , a woman from the crowd call out and say to he , bless be the womb that carry you and the breast at which you nurse .        he reply , rather , bless be those who hear the word of God and observe it . the demand for a Sign .        while still more people gather in the crowd , he say to they ,    this generation be an evil generation ; it seek a sign , but no sign will be give it , except the sign of Jonah .        just as Jonah become a sign to the ninevite , so will the Son of Man be to this generation .      at the judgment the queen of the south will rise with the man of this generation and she will condemn they , because she come from the end of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon , and there be something great than Solomon here .        at the judgment the man of Nineveh will arise with this generation and condemn it , because at the preaching of Jonah they repent , and there be something great than Jonah here .     the simile of Light .     no one who light a lamp hide it away or place it [ under a bushel basket ] , but on a lampstand so that those who enter might see the light .        the lamp of the body be your eye .    when your eye be sound , then your whole body be fill with light , but when it be bad , then your body be in darkness .      take care , then , that the light in you not become darkness .      if your whole body be full of light , and no part of it be in darkness , then it will be as full of light as a lamp illuminate you with its brightness . denunciation of the Pharisees and Scholars of the Law .         after he have speak , a Pharisee invite he to dine at his home . he enter and recline at table to eat .        the Pharisee be amazed to see that he do not observe the prescribed washing before the meal .        the Lord say to he , oh you Pharisees !    although you cleanse the outside of the cup and the dish , inside you be fill with plunder and evil .      you fool ! do not the maker of the outside also make the inside ?      but as to what be within , give alm , and behold , everything will be clean for you .      Woe to you Pharisees ! you pay tithe of mint and of rue and of every garden herb , but you pay no attention to judgment and to love for God . these you should have do , without overlook the other .        Woe to you Pharisees ! you love the seat of honor in synagogue and greeting in marketplace .        Woe to you ! you be like unseen grave    over which people unknowingly walk .      then one of the scholar of the law    say to he in reply , teacher , by say this you be insult we too .        and he say , Woe also to you scholar of the law ! you impose on people burden hard to carry , but you yourself do not lift one finger to touch they .       Woe to you ! you build the memorial of the prophet whom your ancestor kill .      consequently , you bear witness and give consent to the deed of your ancestor , for they kill they and you do the building .       therefore , the wisdom of God say , I will send to they prophet and apostle ;    some of they they will kill and persecute      in order that this generation might be charge with the blood of all the prophet shed since the foundation of the world ,      from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah    who die between the altar and the temple building . yes , I tell you , this generation will be charge with their blood !        Woe to you , scholar of the law ! you have take away the key of knowledge . you yourself do not enter and you stop those try to enter .        when he leave , the scribe and Pharisees begin to act with hostility toward he and to interrogate he about many thing ,        for they be plot to catch he at something he might say .
