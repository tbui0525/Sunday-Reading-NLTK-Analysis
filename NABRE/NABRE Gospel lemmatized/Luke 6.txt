b '   debate about the Sabbath .       while he be go through a field of grain on a sabbath , his disciple be pick the head of grain , rub they in their hand , and eat they .        some Pharisees say , why be you do what be unlawful on the sabbath ?       Jesus say to they in reply , have you not read what David do when he and those [ who be ] with he be hungry ?      [ how ] he go into the house of God , take the bread of offering ,    which only the priest could lawfully eat , eat of it , and share it with his companion .        then he say to they , the Son of Man be lord of the sabbath .      on another sabbath he go into the synagogue and teach , and there be a man there whose right hand be wither .      the scribe and the Pharisees watch he closely to see if he would cure on the sabbath so that they might discover a reason to accuse he .        but he realize their intention and say to the man with the withered hand , come up and stand before we . and he rise and stand there .        then Jesus say to they , I ask you , be it lawful to do good on the sabbath rather than to do evil , to save life rather than to destroy it ?      look around at they all , he then say to he , stretch out your hand . he do so and his hand be restore .      but they become enraged and discuss together what they might do to Jesus . the Mission of the Twelve .         in those day he depart to the mountain to pray , and he spend the night in prayer    to God .      when day come , he call his disciple to himself , and from they he choose twelve ,    whom he also name apostle :       Simon , whom he name Peter ,    and his brother Andrew , James , John , Philip , Bartholomew ,      Matthew , Thomas , James the son of Alphaeus , Simon who be call a zealot ,        and Judas the son of James , and Judas Iscariot ,    who become a traitor . minister to a Great Multitude .         and he come down with they and stand on a stretch of level ground . a great crowd of his disciple and a large number of the people from all Judea and Jerusalem and the coastal region of Tyre and Sidon      come to hear he and to be heal of their disease ; and even those who be torment by unclean spirit be cure .      everyone in the crowd seek to touch he because power come forth from he and heal they all . Sermon on the Plain .         and raise his eye toward his disciple he say : bless be you who be poor ,    for the kingdom of God be yours .   bless be you who be now hungry ,   for you will be satisfied . bless be you who be now weep ,   for you will laugh .    bless be you when people hate you ,   and when they exclude and insult you ,   and denounce your name as evil   on account of the Son of Man .      rejoice and leap for joy on that day ! behold , your reward will be great in heaven . for their ancestor treat the prophet in the same way .      but woe to you who be rich ,   for you have receive your consolation .    but woe to you who be fill now ,   for you will be hungry . woe to you who laugh now ,   for you will grieve and weep .    Woe to you when all speak well of you ,   for their ancestor treat the false prophet in this way .   Love of Enemies .         but to you who hear I say , love your enemy , do good to those who hate you ,        bless those who curse you , pray for those who mistreat you .        to the person who strike you on one cheek , offer the other one as well , and from the person who take your cloak , do not withhold even your tunic .      give to everyone who ask of you , and from the one who take what be yours do not demand it back .      do to other as you would have they do to you .        for if you love those who love you , what credit be that to you ? even sinner love those who love they .      and if you do good to those who do good to you , what credit be that to you ? even sinner do the same .      if you lend money to those from whom you expect repayment , what credit [ be ] that to you ? even sinner lend to sinner , and get back the same amount .        but rather , love your enemy and do good to they , and lend expect nothing back ; then your reward will be great and you will be child of the most high , for he himself be kind to the ungrateful and the wicked .        be merciful , just as [ also ] your Father be merciful . judge other .         stop judge and you will not be judge . stop condemn and you will not be condemn . forgive and you will be forgive .        give and gift will be give to you ; a good measure , pack together , shake down , and overflowing , will be pour into your lap . for the measure with which you measure will in return be measure out to you .        and he tell they a parable , can a blind person guide a blind person ? will not both fall into a pit ?        no disciple be superior to the teacher ; but when fully train , every disciple will be like his teacher .        why do you notice the splinter in your brother eye , but do not perceive the wooden beam in your own ?      how can you say to your brother , Brother , let I remove that splinter in your eye , when you do not even notice the wooden beam in your own eye ? you hypocrite ! remove the wooden beam from your eye first ; then you will see clearly to remove the splinter in your brother eye . a tree know by its Fruit .         a good tree do not bear rotten fruit , nor do a rotten tree bear good fruit .      for every tree be know by its own fruit . for people do not pick fig from thornbushe , nor do they gather grape from bramble .      a good person out of the store of goodness in his heart produce good , but an evil person out of a store of evil produce evil ; for from the fullness of the heart the mouth speak .    the Two Foundations .      why do you call I , Lord , Lord , but not do what I command ?       I will show you what someone be like who come to I , listen to my word , and act on they .        that one be like a person build a house , who dig deeply and lay the foundation on rock ; when the flood come , the river burst against that house but could not shake it because it have be well build .      but the one who listen and do not act be like a person who build a house on the ground without a foundation . when the river burst against it , it collapse at once and be completely destroy .
