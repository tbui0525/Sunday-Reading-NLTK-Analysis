b '   a woman catch in Adultery .    [   then each go to his own house ,      while Jesus go to the Mount of Olives .         but early in the morning he arrive again in the temple area , and all the people start come to he , and he sit down and teach they .      then the scribe and the Pharisees bring a woman who have be catch in adultery and make she stand in the middle .      they say to he , teacher , this woman be catch in the very act of commit adultery .      now in the law , Moses command we to stone such woman .    so what do you say ?        they say this to test he , so that they could have some charge to bring against he . Jesus bend down and begin to write on the ground with his finger .         but when they continue ask he , he straighten up and say to they ,    let the one among you who be without sin be the first to throw a stone at she .      again he bend down and write on the ground .      and in response , they go away one by one , begin with the elder . so he be leave alone with the woman before he .      then Jesus straighten up and say to she , Woman , where be they ? have no one condemn you ?        she reply , no one , sir . then Jesus say , neither do I condemn you . go , [ and ] from now on do not sin any more . ]   the Light of the World .        Jesus speak to they again , say , I be the light of the world . whoever follow I will not walk in darkness , but will have the light of life .        so the Pharisees say to he , you testify on your own behalf , so your testimony can not be verify .      Jesus answer and say to they , even if I do testify on my own behalf , my testimony can be verify ,    because I know where I come from and where I be go . but you do not know where I come from or where I be go .        you judge by appearance ,    but I do not judge anyone .        and even if I should judge , my judgment be valid , because I be not alone , but it be I and the Father who send I .        even in your law    it be write that the testimony of two man can be verify .        I testify on my behalf and so do the Father who send I .        so they say to he , where be your father ? Jesus answer , you know neither I nor my Father . if you know I , you would know my Father also .        he speak these word while teach in the treasury in the temple area . but no one arrest he , because his hour have not yet come .   Jesus , the Fathers Ambassador .        he say to they again , I be go away and you will look for I , but you will die in your sin .    where I be go you can not come .         so the Jews say , he be not go to kill himself , be he , because he say , where I be go you can not come ?      he say to they , you belong to what be below , I belong to what be above . you belong to this world , but I do not belong to this world .        that be why I tell you that you will die in your sin . for if you do not believe that I be ,    you will die in your sin .         so they say to he , who be you ?    Jesus say to they , what I tell you from the beginning .      I have much to say about you in condemnation . but the one who send I be true , and what I hear from he I tell the world .        they do not realize that he be speak to they of the Father .      so Jesus say [ to they ] , when you lift up the Son of Man , then you will realize that I be , and that I do nothing on my own , but I say only what the Father teach I .        the one who send I be with I . he have not leave I alone , because I always do what be pleasing to he .      because he speak this way , many come to believe in he . Jesus and Abraham .        Jesus then say to those Jews who believe in he ,    if you remain in my word , you will truly be my disciple ,      and you will know the truth , and the truth will set you free .        they answer he , we be descendant of Abraham and have never be enslave to anyone .    how can you say , you will become free ?        Jesus answer they , amen , amen , I say to you , everyone who commit sin be a slave of sin .        a slave do not remain in a household forever , but a son    always remain .        so if a son free you , then you will truly be free .      I know that you be descendant of Abraham . but you be try to kill I , because my word have no room among you .       I tell you what I have see in the Fathers presence ; then do what you have hear from the Father .      they answer and say to he , our father be Abraham . Jesus say to they ,    if you be Abrahams child , you would be do the work of Abraham .      but now you be try to kill I , a man who have tell you the truth that I hear from God ; Abraham do not do this .      you be do the work of your father ! [ so ] they say to he , we be not illegitimate . we have one Father , God .        Jesus say to they , if God be your Father , you would love I , for I come from God and be here ; I do not come on my own , but he send I .        why do you not understand what I be say ? because you can not bear to hear my word .      you belong to your father the devil and you willingly carry out your father desire . he be a murderer from the beginning and do not stand in truth , because there be no truth in he . when he tell a lie , he speak in character , because he be a liar and the father of lie .        but because I speak the truth , you do not believe I .      can any of you charge I with sin ? if I be tell the truth , why do you not believe I ?        whoever belong to God hear the word of God ; for this reason you do not listen , because you do not belong to God .      the Jews answer and say to he , be we not right in say that you be a Samaritan    and be possess ?      Jesus answer , I be not possess ; I honor my Father , but you dishonor I .      I do not seek my own glory ; there be one who seek it and he be the one who judge .        amen , amen , I say to you , whoever keep my word will never see death .        [ so ] the Jews say to he , now we be sure that you be possess . Abraham die , as do the prophet , yet you say , whoever keep my word will never taste death .      be you great than our father Abraham ,    who die ? or the prophet , who die ? who do you make yourself out to be ?        Jesus answer , if I glorify myself , my glory be worth nothing ; but it be my Father who glorify I , of whom you say , he be our God .      you do not know he , but I know he . and if I should say that I do not know he , I would be like you a liar . but I do know he and I keep his word .        Abraham your father rejoice to see my day ; he see it    and be glad .        so the Jews say to he , you be not yet fifty year old and you have see Abraham ?         Jesus say to they ,    amen , amen , I say to you , before Abraham come to be , I be .      so they pick up stone to throw at he ; but Jesus hide and go out of the temple area .              '
