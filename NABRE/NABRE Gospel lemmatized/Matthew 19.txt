b '    marriage and divorce .      when Jesus    finish these word ,    he leave Galilee and go to the district of Judea across the Jordan .      great crowd follow he , and he cure they there .       some Pharisees approach he , and test he ,    say , be it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any cause whatever ?        he say in reply , have you not read that from the beginning the Creator make they male and female       and say , for this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be join to his wife , and the two shall become one flesh ?      so they be no long two , but one flesh . therefore , what God have join together , no human being must separate .        they say to he , then why do Moses command that the man give the woman a bill of divorce and dismiss [ she ] ?      he say to they , because of the hardness of your heart Moses allow you to divorce your wife , but from the beginning it be not so .       I say to you ,    whoever divorce his wife ( unless the marriage be unlawful ) and marry another commit adultery .      [ his ] disciple say to he , if that be the case of a man with his wife , it be well not to marry .      he answer , not all can accept [ this ] word ,    but only those to whom that be grant .      some be incapable of marriage because they be bear so ; some , because they be make so by other ; some , because they have renounce marriage    for the sake of the kingdom of heaven . whoever can accept this ought to accept it . blessing of the Children .         then child be bring to he that he might lay his hand on they and pray . the disciple rebuke they ,       but Jesus say , let the child come to I , and do not prevent they ; for the kingdom of heaven belong to such as these .      after he place his hand on they , he go away . the Rich Young Man .         now someone approach he and say , teacher , what good must I do to gain eternal life ?        he answer he , why do you ask I about the good ? there be only one who be good .    if you wish to enter into life , keep the commandment .        he ask he , which one ? and Jesus reply ,   you shall not kill ; you shall not commit adultery ; you shall not steal ; you shall not bear false witness ;      honor your father and your mother ; and you shall love your neighbor as yourself .       the young man say to he , all of these I have observe . what do I still lack ?       Jesus say to he , if you wish to be perfect ,    go , sell what you have and give to [ the ] poor , and you will have treasure in heaven . then come , follow I .      when the young man hear this statement , he go away sad , for he have many possession .       then Jesus say to his disciple , amen , I say to you , it will be hard for one who be rich to enter the kingdom of heaven .       again I say to you , it be easy for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for one who be rich to enter the kingdom of God .       when the disciple hear this , they be greatly astonish and say , who then can be save ?       Jesus look at they and say , for human being this be impossible , but for God all thing be possible .       then Peter say to he in reply , we have give up everything and follow you . what will there be for we ?        Jesus say to they , amen , I say to you that you who have follow I , in the new age , when the Son of Man be seat on his throne of glory , will yourself sit on twelve throne , judge the twelve tribe of Israel .      and everyone who have give up house or brother or sister or father or mother or child or land for the sake of my name will receive a hundred time more , and will inherit eternal life .        but many who be first will be last , and the last will be first .
