Jesus say to he in reply , you have say so .    but I tell you : from now on you will see the Son of Man   seat at the right hand of the Power   and come on the cloud of heaven .     then the high priest tear his robe and say , he have blaspheme !    what further need have we of witness ? you have now hear the blasphemy ;      what be your opinion ? they say in reply , he deserve to die !        then they spit in his face and strike he , while some slap he ,      say , Prophesy for we , Messiah : who be it that strike you ?
