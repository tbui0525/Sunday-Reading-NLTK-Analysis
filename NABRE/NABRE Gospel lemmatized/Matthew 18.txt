b ' the great in the Kingdom .      at that time the disciple    approach Jesus and say , who be the great in the kingdom of heaven ?      he call a child over , place it in their midst ,       and say , amen , I say to you , unless you turn and become like child ,    you will not enter the kingdom of heaven .       whoever humble himself like this child be the great in the kingdom of heaven .       and whoever receive one child such as this in my name receive I .    temptation to Sin .      whoever cause one of these little one    who believe in I to sin , it would be well for he to have a great millstone hang around his neck and to be drown in the depth of the sea .       Woe to the world because of thing that cause sin ! such thing must come , but woe to the one through whom they come !       if your hand or foot cause you to sin ,    cut it off and throw it away . it be well for you to enter into life maim or crippled than with two hand or two foot to be throw into eternal fire .      and if your eye cause you to sin , tear it out and throw it away . it be well for you to enter into life with one eye than with two eye to be throw into fiery Gehenna . the parable of the Lost Sheep .         see that you do not despise one of these little one ,    for I say to you that their angel in heaven always look upon the face of my heavenly Father .     [   ]         what be your opinion ? if a man have a hundred sheep and one of they go astray , will he not leave the ninety - nine in the hill and go in search of the stray ?      and if he find it , amen , I say to you , he rejoice more over it than over the ninety - nine that do not stray .      in just the same way , it be not the will of your heavenly Father that one of these little one be lose . a brother who Sins .         if your brother    sin [ against you ] , go and tell he his fault between you and he alone . if he listen to you , you have win over your brother .        if he do not listen , take one or two other along with you , so that every fact may be establish on the testimony of two or three witness .       if he refuse to listen to they , tell the church .    if he refuse to listen even to the church , then treat he as you would a gentile or a tax collector .        amen , I say to you , whatever you bind on earth shall be bind in heaven , and whatever you loose on earth shall be loose in heaven .        again , [ amen , ] I say to you , if two of you agree on earth about anything for which they be to pray , it shall be grant to they by my heavenly Father .        for where two or three be gather together in my name , there be I in the midst of they . the parable of the Unforgiving Servant .         then Peter approaching ask he , Lord , if my brother sin against I , how often must I forgive he ? as many as seven time ?       Jesus answer , I say to you , not seven time but seventy - seven time .       that be why the kingdom of heaven may be liken to a king who decide to settle account with his servant .       when he begin the accounting , a debtor be bring before he who owe he a huge amount .      since he have no way of pay it back , his master order he to be sell , along with his wife , his child , and all his property , in payment of the debt .       at that , the servant fall down , do he homage , and say , be patient with I , and I will pay you back in full .      move with compassion the master of that servant let he go and forgave he the loan .      when that servant have leave , he find one of his fellow servant who owe he a much small amount .    he seize he and start to choke he , demand , pay back what you owe .      fall to his knee , his fellow servant beg he , be patient with I , and I will pay you back .      but he refuse . instead , he have he put in prison until he pay back the debt .      now when his fellow servant see what have happen , they be deeply disturbed , and go to their master and report the whole affair .      his master summon he and say to he , you wicked servant ! I forgave you your entire debt because you beg I to .       should you not have have pity on your fellow servant , as I have pity on you ?      then in anger his master hand he over to the torturer until he should pay back the whole debt .          so will my heavenly Father do to you , unless each of you forgive his brother from his heart .
