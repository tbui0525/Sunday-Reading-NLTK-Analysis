b '   last supper discourse .      do not let your heart be trouble . you have faith    in God ; have faith also in I .      in my Fathers house there be many dwelling place . if there be not , would I have tell you that I be go to prepare a place for you ?       and if I go and prepare a place for you , I will come back again and take you to myself , so that where I be you also may be .        where [ i ] be go you know the way .        Thomas say to he , Master , we do not know where you be go ; how can we know the way ?      Jesus say to he , I be the way and the truth    and the life . no one come to the Father except through I .        if you know I , then you will also know my Father .    from now on you do know he and have see he .        Philip say to he , Master , show we the Father ,    and that will be enough for we .        Jesus say to he , have I be with you for so long a time and you still do not know I , Philip ? whoever have see I have see the Father . how can you say , show we the Father ?        do you not believe that I be in the Father and the Father be in I ? the word that I speak to you I do not speak on my own . the Father who dwell in I be do his work .        believe I that I be in the Father and the Father be in I , or else , believe because of the work themselves .        amen , amen , I say to you , whoever believe in I will do the work that I do , and will do great one than these , because I be go to the Father .        and whatever you ask in my name , I will do , so that the Father may be glorify in the Son .        if you ask anything of I in my name , I will do it .    the Advocate .     if you love I , you will keep my commandment .        and I will ask the Father , and he will give you another Advocate    to be with you always ,        the Spirit of truth ,    which the world can not accept , because it neither see nor know it . but you know it , because it remain with you , and will be in you .        I will not leave you orphan ; I will come to you .        in a little while the world will no long see I , but you will see I , because I live and you will live .        on that day you will realize that I be in my Father and you be in I and I in you .        whoever have my commandment and observe they be the one who love I . and whoever love I will be love by my Father , and I will love he and reveal myself to he .        Judas , not the Iscariot ,    say to he , Master , [ then ] what happen that you will reveal yourself to we and not to the world ?        Jesus answer and say to he , whoever love I will keep my word , and my Father will love he , and we will come to he and make our dwelling with he .        whoever do not love I do not keep my word ; yet the word you hear be not mine but that of the Father who send I .     I have tell you this while I be with you .      the Advocate , the holy Spirit that the Father will send in my name\xe2\x80\x94he will teach you everything and remind you of all that [ i ] tell you .        Peace    I leave with you ; my peace I give to you . not as the world give do I give it to you . do not let your heart be troubled or afraid .         you hear I tell you , I be go away and I will come back to you .    if you love I , you would rejoice that I be go to the Father ; for the Father be great than i.      and now I have tell you this before it happen , so that when it happen you may believe .        I will no long speak much with you , for the ruler of the world    be come . he have no power over I ,      but the world must know that I love the Father and that I do just as the Father have command I . get up , let we go .
