Jesus send out these twelve    after instruct they thus , do not go into pagan territory or enter a samaritan town .       go rather to the lose sheep of the house of Israel .      as you go , make this proclamation : the kingdom of heaven be at hand .         cure the sick , raise the dead , cleanse leper , drive out demon . without cost you have receive ; without cost you be to give .       do not take gold or silver or copper for your belt ;       no sack for the journey , or a second tunic , or sandal , or walk stick . the laborer deserve his keep .       whatever town or village you enter , look for a worthy person in it , and stay there until you leave .      as you enter a house , wish it peace .      if the house be worthy , let your peace come upon it ; if not , let your peace return to you .          whoever will not receive you or listen to your words\xe2\x80\x94go outside that house or town and shake the dust from your foot .      amen , I say to you , it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that town .     come Persecutions .      behold , I be send you like sheep in the midst of wolf ; so be shrewd as serpent and simple as dove .       but beware of people ,    for they will hand you over to court and scourge you in their synagogue ,        and you will be lead before governor and king for my sake as a witness before they and the pagan .      when they hand you over , do not worry about how you be to speak or what you be to say . you will be give at that moment what you be to say .        for it will not be you who speak but the Spirit of your Father speak through you .        Brother will hand over brother to death , and the father his child ; child will rise up against parent and have they put to death .      you will be hate by all because of my name , but whoever endure to the end    will be save .      when they persecute you in one town , flee to another . amen , I say to you , you will not finish the town of Israel before the Son of Man come .         no disciple be above his teacher , no slave above his master .      it be enough for the disciple that he become like his teacher , for the slave that he become like his master . if they have call the master of the house Beelzebul ,    how much more those of his household !    Courage under Persecution .      therefore do not be afraid of they . nothing be conceal that will not be reveal , nor secret that will not be know .         what I say to you in the darkness , speak in the light ; what you hear whisper , proclaim on the housetop .      and do not be afraid of those who kill the body but can not kill the soul ; rather , be afraid of the one who can destroy both soul and body in Gehenna .        be not two sparrow sell for a small coin ? yet not one of they fall to the ground without your Fathers knowledge .      even all the hair of your head be count .      so do not be afraid ; you be worth more than many sparrow .       everyone who acknowledge I before other I will acknowledge before my heavenly Father .      but whoever deny I before other , I will deny before my heavenly Father .     Jesus : a Cause of Division .      do not think that I have come to bring peace upon the earth . I have come to bring not peace but the sword .      for I have come to set a man against his father ,   a daughter against her mother , and a daughter - in - law against her mother - in - law ;    and one enemy will be those of his household .    the Conditions of Discipleship .      whoever love father or mother more than I be not worthy of I , and whoever love son or daughter more than I be not worthy of I ;      and whoever do not take up his cross    and follow after I be not worthy of I .        whoever find his life will lose it , and whoever lose his life for my sake will find it .    reward .     whoever receive you receive I ,    and whoever receive I receive the one who send I .         whoever receive a prophet because he be a prophet will receive a prophet reward , and whoever receive a righteous man because he be righteous will receive a righteous mans reward .      and whoever give only a cup of cold water to one of these little one to drink because he be a disciple\xe2\x80\x94amen , I say to you , he will surely not lose his reward .
