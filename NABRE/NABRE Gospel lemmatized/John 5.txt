b ' cure on a Sabbath .     after this , there be a feast    of the Jews , and Jesus go up to Jerusalem .        now there be in Jerusalem at the Sheep [ Gate ]    a pool call in Hebrew Bethesda , with five portico .        in these lay a large number of ill , blind , lame , and cripple .       [   ]        one man be there who have be ill for thirty - eight year .      when Jesus see he lie there and know that he have be ill for a long time , he say to he , do you want to be well ?      the sick man answer he , Sir , I have no one to put I into the pool when the water be stir up ; while I be on my way , someone else get down there before I .      Jesus say to he , rise , take up your mat , and walk .        immediately the man become well , take up his mat , and walk .   now that day be a sabbath .      so the Jews say to the man who be cure , it be the sabbath , and it be not lawful for you to carry your mat .        he answer they , the man who make I well tell I , take up your mat and walk .      they ask he , who be the man who tell you , take it up and walk ?      the man who be heal do not know who it be , for Jesus have slip away , since there be a crowd there .         after this Jesus find he in the temple area and say to he ,    look , you be well ; do not sin any more , so that nothing bad may happen to you .      the man go and tell the Jews that Jesus be the one who have make he well .      therefore , the Jews begin to persecute Jesus because he do this on a sabbath .         but Jesus answer they ,    my Father be at work until now , so I be at work .      for this reason the Jews try all the more to kill he , because he not only break the sabbath but he also call God his own father , make himself equal to God .     the Work of the Son .      Jesus answer and say to they , amen , amen , I say to you , a son can not do anything on his own , but only what he see his father do ;    for what he do , his son will do also .      for the Father love his Son and show he everything that he himself do , and he will show he great work than these , so that you may be amazed .        for just as the Father raise the dead and give life ,    so also do the Son give life to whomever he wish .        nor do the Father judge anyone , but he have give all judgment    to his Son ,        so that all may honor the Son just as they honor the Father . whoever do not honor the Son do not honor the Father who send he .      amen , amen , I say to you , whoever hear my word and believe in the one who send I have eternal life and will not come to condemnation , but have pass from death to life .        amen , amen , I say to you , the hour be come and be now here when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God , and those who hear will live .        for just as the Father have life in himself , so also he give to his Son the possession of life in himself .        and he give he power to exercise judgment , because he be the Son of Man .         do not be amazed at this , because the hour be come in which all who be in the tomb will hear his voice        and will come out , those who have do good deed to the resurrection of life , but those who have do wicked deed to the resurrection of condemnation .      I can not do anything on my own ; I judge as I hear , and my judgment be just , because I do not seek my own will but the will of the one who send I .     witness to Jesus .      if I testify on my own behalf , my testimony can not be verify .      but there be another    who testify on my behalf , and I know that the testimony he give on my behalf be true .      you send emissary to John , and he testify to the truth .        I do not accept testimony from a human being , but I say this so that you may be save .        he be a burning and shine lamp ,    and for a while you be content to rejoice in his light .        but I have testimony great than Johns . the work that the Father give I to accomplish , these work that I perform testify on my behalf that the Father have send I .        moreover , the Father who send I have testify on my behalf . but you have never hear his voice nor see his form ,        and you do not have his word remain in you , because you do not believe in the one whom he have send .        you search    the scripture , because you think you have eternal life through they ; even they testify on my behalf .        but you do not want to come to I to have life .    Unbelief of Jesus Hearers .     I do not accept human praise ;        moreover , I know that you do not have the love of God in you .        I come in the name of my Father , but you do not accept I ; yet if another come in his own name , you will accept he .        how can you believe , when you accept praise from one another and do not seek the praise that come from the only God ?        do not think that I will accuse you before the Father : the one who will accuse you be Moses , in whom you have place your hope .        for if you have believe Moses , you would have believe I , because he write about I .        but if you do not believe his writing , how will you believe my word ?
