b '      then Pilate take Jesus and have he scourge .      and the soldier wove a crown out of thorn and place it on his head , and clothe he in a purple cloak ,      and they come to he and say , Hail , king of the Jews ! and they strike he repeatedly .      once more Pilate go out and say to they , look , I be bring he out to you , so that you may know that I find no guilt in he .        so Jesus come out , wear the crown of thorn and the purple cloak . and he say to they , Behold , the man !        when the chief priest and the guard see he they cry out , crucify he , crucify he ! Pilate say to they , take he yourselves and crucify he . I find no guilt in he .         the Jews answer ,    we have a law , and accord to that law he ought to die , because he make himself the Son of God .      now when Pilate hear this statement , he become even more afraid ,      and go back into the praetorium and say to Jesus , where be you from ? Jesus do not answer he .        so Pilate say to he , do you not speak to I ? do you not know that I have power to release you and I have power to crucify you ?      Jesus answer [ he ] , you would have no power over I if it have not be give to you from above . for this reason the one who hand I over to you have the great sin .        consequently , Pilate try to release he ; but the Jews cry out , if you release he , you be not a Friend of Caesar .    everyone who make himself a king oppose Caesar .      when Pilate hear these word he bring Jesus out and seat he    on the judge bench in the place call Stone Pavement , in Hebrew , Gabbatha .      it be preparation day for Passover , and it be about noon .    and he say to the Jews , behold , your king !      they cry out , take he away , take he away ! crucify he ! Pilate say to they , shall I crucify your king ? the chief priest answer , we have no king but Caesar .      then he hand he over to they to be crucify .   the Crucifixion of Jesus .   so they take Jesus ,       and carry the cross himself    he go out to what be call the Place of the Skull , in Hebrew , Golgotha .      there they crucify he , and with he two other , one on either side , with Jesus in the middle .       Pilate also have an inscription write and put on the cross . it read , Jesus the Nazorean , the King of the Jews .      now many of the Jews read this inscription , because the place where Jesus be crucify be near the city ; and it be write in Hebrew , Latin , and Greek .      so the chief priest of the Jews say to Pilate , do not write the king of the Jews , but that he say , I be the king of the Jews .        Pilate answer , what I have write , I have write .      when the soldier have crucify Jesus ,    they take his clothe and divide they into four share , a share for each soldier .    they also take his tunic , but the tunic be seamless , weave in one piece from the top down .      so they say to one another , lets not tear it , but cast lot for it to see whose it will be , in order that the passage of scripture might be fulfil [ that say ] : they divide my garment among they ,   and for my vesture they cast lot . this be what the soldier do .        stand by the cross of Jesus be his mother and his mother sister , Mary the wife of Clopas , and Mary of Magdala .      when Jesus see his mother    and the disciple there whom he love , he say to his mother , Woman , behold , your son .        then he say to the disciple , behold , your mother . and from that hour the disciple take she into his home .      after this , aware that everything be now finish , in order that the scripture might be fulfil ,    Jesus say , I thirst .        there be a vessel fill with common wine .    so they put a sponge soak in wine on a sprig of hyssop and put it up to his mouth .       when Jesus have take the wine , he say , it be finish .    and bow his head , he hand over the spirit .    the Blood and Water .     now since it be preparation day , in order that the body might not remain on the cross on the sabbath , for the sabbath day of that week be a solemn one , the Jews ask Pilate that their leg be break and they be take down .        so the soldier come and break the leg of the first and then of the other one who be crucify with Jesus .      but when they come to Jesus and see that he be already dead , they do not break his leg ,        but one soldier thrust his lance into his side , and immediately blood and water flow out .      an eyewitness have testify , and his testimony be true ; he know    that he be speak the truth , so that you also may [ come to ] believe .        for this happen so that the scripture passage might be fulfil : not a bone of it will be break .      and again another passage say : they will look upon he whom they have pierce .   the Burial of Jesus .         after this , Joseph of Arimathea , secretly a disciple of Jesus for fear of the Jews , ask Pilate if he could remove the body of Jesus . and Pilate permit it . so he come and take his body .      Nicodemus , the one who have first come to he at night , also come bring a mixture of myrrh and aloe weigh about one hundred pound .        they take the body of Jesus and bind it with burial cloth along with the spice , accord to the jewish burial custom .      now in the place where he have be crucify there be a garden , and in the garden a new tomb , in which no one have yet be bury .      so they lay Jesus there because of the jewish preparation day ; for the tomb be close by .
