Jesus immediately know in his mind what they be think to themselves , so he say , why be you think such thing in your heart ?      which be easy , to say to the paralytic , your sin be forgive , or to say , rise , pick up your mat and walk ?       but that you may know that the Son of Man have authority to forgive sin on earth\xe2\x80\x94      he say to the paralytic , I say to you , rise , pick up your mat , and go home .      he rise , pick up his mat at once , and go away in the sight of everyone . they be all astounded and glorify God , say , we have never see anything like this .    the call of Levi .       once again he go out along the sea . all the crowd come to he and he teach they .       as he pass by ,    he see Levi , son of Alphaeus , sit at the custom post . he say to he , follow I . and he get up and follow he .      while he be at table in his house ,    many tax collector and sinner sit with Jesus and his disciple ; for there be many who follow he .       some scribe who be Pharisees see that he be eat with sinner and tax collector and say to his disciple , why do he eat with tax collector and sinner ?
