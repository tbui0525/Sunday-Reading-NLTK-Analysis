b '   the demand for a Sign .       the Pharisees and Sadducees come and , to test he , ask he to show they a sign from heaven .       he say to they in reply , [ in the evening you say , tomorrow will be fair , for the sky be red ;       and , in the morning , today will be stormy , for the sky be red and threatening . you know how to judge the appearance of the sky , but you can not judge the sign of the time . ]       an evil and unfaithful generation seek a sign , but no sign will be give it except the sign of Jonah .    then he leave they and go away .    the Leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees .      in come to the other side of the sea ,    the disciple have forget to bring bread .       Jesus say to they , look out , and beware of the leaven    of the Pharisees and Sadducees .       they conclude among themselves , say , it be because we have bring no bread .      when Jesus become aware of this he say , you of little faith , why do you conclude among yourself that it be because you have no bread ?       do you not yet understand , and do you not remember the five loaf for the five thousand , and how many wicker basket you take up ?       or the seven loaf for the four thousand , and how many basket you take up ?      how do you not comprehend that I be not speak to you about bread ? beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees .      then they understand    that he be not tell they to beware of the leaven of bread , but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees . Peters Confession about Jesus .         when Jesus go into the region of Caesarea Philippi    he ask his disciple , who do people say that the Son of Man be ?       they reply , some say John the Baptist ,    other Elijah , still other Jeremiah or one of the prophet .      he say to they , but who do you say that I be ?        Simon Peter say in reply , you be the Messiah , the Son of the live God .      Jesus say to he in reply , bless be you , Simon son of Jonah . for flesh and blood    have not reveal this to you , but my heavenly Father .       and so I say to you , you be Peter , and upon this rock I will build my church ,    and the gate of the netherworld shall not prevail against it .       I will give you the key to the kingdom of heaven .    whatever you bind on earth shall be bind in heaven ; and whatever you loose on earth shall be loose in heaven .        then he strictly order his disciple to tell no one that he be the Messiah . the First Prediction of the passion .         from that time on , Jesus begin to show his disciple that he    must go to Jerusalem and suffer greatly from the elder , the chief priest , and the scribe , and be kill and on the third day be raise .         then Peter take he aside and begin to rebuke he , God forbid , Lord ! no such thing shall ever happen to you .       he turn and say to Peter , get behind I , Satan ! you be an obstacle to I . you be think not as God do , but as human being do . the condition of Discipleship .         then Jesus say to his disciple , whoever wish to come after I must deny himself ,    take up his cross , and follow I .       for whoever wish to save his life will lose it , but whoever lose his life for my sake will find it .        what profit would there be for one to gain the whole world and forfeit his life ? or what can one give in exchange for his life ?        for the Son of Man will come with his angel in his Fathers glory , and then he will repay everyone accord to his conduct .       amen , I say to you , there be some stand here who will not taste death until they see the Son of Man come in his kingdom .
