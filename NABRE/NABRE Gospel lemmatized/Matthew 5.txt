b '   the Sermon on the Mount .      when he see the crowd ,    he go up the mountain , and after he have sit down , his disciple come to he .      he begin to teach they , say :    the Beatitudes    bless be the poor in spirit ,    for theirs be the kingdom of heaven .     bless be they who mourn ,    for they will be comfort .    bless be the meek ,    for they will inherit the land .   bless be they who hunger and thirst for righteousness ,    for they will be satisfied .   bless be the merciful ,   for they will be show mercy .     bless be the clean of heart ,    for they will see God .   bless be the peacemaker ,   for they will be call child of God .   bless be they who be persecute for the sake of righteousness ,    for theirs be the kingdom of heaven .      bless be you when they insult you and persecute you and utter every kind of evil against you [ falsely ] because of I .         rejoice and be glad , for your reward will be great in heaven .    thus they persecute the prophet who be before you . the simile of Salt and Light .         you be the salt of the earth . but if salt lose its taste , with what can it be season ? it be no long good for anything but to be throw out and trample underfoot .        you be the light of the world . a city set on a mountain can not be hide .        nor do they light a lamp and then put it under a bushel basket ; it be set on a lampstand , where it give light to all in the house .        just so , your light must shine before other , that they may see your good deed and glorify your heavenly Father .     teach about the Law .      do not think that I have come to abolish the law or the prophet . I have come not to abolish but to fulfill .      amen , I say to you , until heaven and earth pass away , not the small letter or the small part of a letter will pass from the law , until all thing have take place .        therefore , whoever break one of the least of these commandment and teach other to do so will be call least in the kingdom of heaven . but whoever obey and teach these commandment will be call great in the kingdom of heaven .        I tell you , unless your righteousness surpass that of the scribe and Pharisees , you will not enter into the kingdom of heaven . teach about Anger .        you have hear that it be say to your ancestor ,    you shall not kill ; and whoever kill will be liable to judgment .         but I say to you , whoever be angry    with his brother will be liable to judgment ,    and whoever say to his brother , Raqa , will be answerable to the Sanhedrin , and whoever say , you fool , will be liable to fiery Gehenna .      therefore , if you bring your gift to the altar , and there recall that your brother have anything against you ,        leave your gift there at the altar , go first and be reconcile with your brother , and then come and offer your gift .      settle with your opponent quickly while on the way to court with he .    otherwise your opponent will hand you over to the judge , and the judge will hand you over to the guard , and you will be throw into prison .      amen , I say to you , you will not be release until you have pay the last penny .    teach about Adultery .      you have hear that it be say ,    you shall not commit adultery .      but I say to you , everyone who look at a woman with lust have already commit adultery with she in his heart .       if your right eye cause you to sin , tear it out and throw it away .    it be well for you to lose one of your member than to have your whole body throw into Gehenna .      and if your right hand cause you to sin , cut it off and throw it away . it be well for you to lose one of your member than to have your whole body go into Gehenna .    teach about divorce .      it be also say , whoever divorce his wife must give she a bill of divorce .        but I say to you , whoever divorce his wife ( unless the marriage be unlawful ) cause she to commit adultery , and whoever marry a divorce woman commit adultery .     teach about oath .       again you have hear that it be say to your ancestor , do not take a false oath , but make good to the Lord all that you vow .       but I say to you , do not swear at all ;    not by heaven , for it be Gods throne ;      nor by the earth , for it be his footstool ; nor by Jerusalem , for it be the city of the great king .      do not swear by your head , for you can not make a single hair white or black .       let your yes mean yes , and your no mean no . anything more be from the evil one .    teach about retaliation .      you have hear that it be say ,    an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth .       but I say to you , offer no resistance to one who be evil . when someone strike you on [ your ] right cheek , turn the other one to he as well .      if anyone want to go to law with you over your tunic , hand he your cloak as well .      should anyone press you into service for one mile ,    go with he for two mile .        give to the one who ask of you , and do not turn your back on one who want to borrow .   Love of Enemies .         you have hear that it be say , you shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy .        but I say to you , love your enemy , and pray for those who persecute you ,      that you may be child of your heavenly Father , for he make his sun rise on the bad and the good , and cause rain to fall on the just and the unjust .      for if you love those who love you , what recompense will you have ? do not the tax collector    do the same ?      and if you greet your brother only , what be unusual about that ? do not the pagan do the same ?        so be perfect ,    just as your heavenly Father be perfect .
