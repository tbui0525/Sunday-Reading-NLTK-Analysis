b '     now when Jesus learn that the Pharisees have hear that Jesus be make and baptize more disciple than John      ( although Jesus himself be not baptize , just his disciple ) ,        he leave Judea and return to Galilee .    the Samaritan Woman .     he have to    pass through Samaria .      so he come to a town of Samaria call Sychar ,    near the plot of land that Jacob have give to his son Joseph .        Jacobs well be there . Jesus , tired from his journey , sit down there at the well . it be about noon .     a woman of Samaria come to draw water . Jesus say to she , give I a drink .      his disciple have go into the town to buy food .       the samaritan woman say to he , how can you , a Jew , ask I , a samaritan woman , for a drink ?    ( for Jews use nothing in common with Samaritans . )       Jesus answer and say to she ,    if you know the gift of God and who be say to you , give I a drink , you would have ask he and he would have give you live water .      [ the woman ] say to he , Sir ,    you do not even have a bucket and the well be deep ; where then can you get this live water ?      be you great than our father Jacob , who give we this well and drink from it himself with his child and his flock ?        Jesus answer and say to she , everyone who drink this water will be thirsty again ;      but whoever drink the water I shall give will never thirst ; the water I shall give will become in he a spring of water well up to eternal life .        the woman say to he , Sir , give I this water , so that I may not be thirsty or have to keep come here to draw water .     Jesus say to she , go call your husband and come back .      the woman answer and say to he , I do not have a husband . Jesus answer she , you be right in say , I do not have a husband .      for you have have five husband , and the one you have now be not your husband . what you have say be true .        the woman say to he , Sir , I can see that you be a prophet .        our ancestor worship on this mountain ;    but you people say that the place to worship be in Jerusalem .        Jesus say to she , believe I , woman , the hour be come when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem .      you people worship what you do not understand ; we worship what we understand , because salvation be from the Jews .        but the hour be come , and be now here , when true worshiper will worship the Father in Spirit and truth ;    and indeed the Father seek such people to worship he .      God be Spirit , and those who worship he must worship in Spirit and truth .         the woman say to he , I know that the Messiah be come ,    the one call the Anointed ; when he come , he will tell we everything .      Jesus say to she , I be he ,    the one who be speak with you .      at that moment his disciple return , and be amazed that he be talk with a woman ,    but still no one say , what be you look for ? or why be you talk with she ?      the woman leave her water jar and go into the town and say to the people ,      come see a man who tell I everything I have do . could he possibly be the Messiah ?      they go out of the town and come to he .      meanwhile , the disciple urge he , Rabbi , eat .      but he say to they , I have food to eat of which you do not know .      so the disciple say to one another , could someone have bring he something to eat ?      Jesus say to they , my food be to do the will of the one who send I and to finish his work .        do you not say , in four month    the harvest will be here ? I tell you , look up and see the field ripe for the harvest .        the reaper be already    receive his payment and gather crop for eternal life , so that the sower and reaper can rejoice together .        for here the saying be verify that one sow and another reap .        I send you to reap what you have not work for ; other have do the work , and you be share the fruit of their work .     many of the Samaritans of that town begin to believe in he because of the word of the woman    who testify , he tell I everything I have do .      when the Samaritans come to he , they invite he to stay with they ; and he stay there two day .      many more begin to believe in he because of his word ,      and they say to the woman , we no long believe because of your word ; for we have hear for ourselves , and we know that this be truly the savior of the world .     return to Galilee .      after the two day , he leave there for Galilee .        for Jesus himself testify that a prophet have no honor in his native place .      when he come into Galilee , the Galileans welcome he , since they have see all he have do in Jerusalem at the feast ; for they themselves have go to the feast . second Sign at Cana .         then he return to Cana in Galilee , where he have make the water wine . now there be a royal official whose son be ill in Capernaum .      when he hear that Jesus have arrive in Galilee from Judea , he go to he and ask he to come down and heal his son , who be near death .      Jesus say to he , unless you people see sign and wonder , you will not believe .        the royal official say to he , Sir , come down before my child die .      Jesus say to he , you may go ; your son will live . the man believe what Jesus say to he and leave .        while he be on his way back , his slave meet he and tell he that his boy would live .      he ask they when he begin to recover . they tell he , the fever leave he yesterday , about one in the afternoon .      the father realize that just at that time Jesus have say to he , your son will live , and he and his whole household come to believe .      [ now ] this be the second sign Jesus do when he come to Galilee from Judea .              '
