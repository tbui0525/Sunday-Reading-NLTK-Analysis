b'  Against the Egyptian Alliance  Ah! Those who go down to Egypt for help,  who rely on horses; Who put their trust in chariots because of their number,  and in horsemen because of their combined power, But look not to the Holy One of Israel  nor seek the  Lord !    Yet he too is wise and will bring disaster;  he will not turn from his threats. He will rise up against the house of the wicked  and against those who help evildoers.

On that day each one of you shall reject his idols of silver and gold, which your hands have made.

He shall rush past his crag   in panic,  and his princes desert the standard in terror, Says the  Lord  who has a fire in Zion  and a furnace in Jerusalem.             '
