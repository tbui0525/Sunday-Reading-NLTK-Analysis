b' The Covenant Between David and God  A song of ascents. I Remember, O  Lord , for David  all his hardships;  How he swore an oath to the  Lord ,  vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob:   I will not enter the house where I live,   nor lie on the couch where I sleep;  I will give my eyes no sleep,  my eyelids no rest,  Till I find a place for the  Lord ,  a dwelling for the Mighty One of Jacob.  We have heard of it in Ephrathah;   we have found it in the fields of Jaar.  Let us enter his dwelling;  let us worship at his footstool.   Arise,  Lord , come to your resting place,   you and your mighty ark.  Your priests will be clothed with justice;  your devout will shout for joy.  For the sake of David your servant,  do not reject your anointed.   II  The  Lord  swore an oath to David in truth,  he will never turn back from it:  Your own offspring   I will set upon your throne.  If your sons observe my covenant,  and my decrees I shall teach them, Their sons, in turn,  shall sit forever on your throne.  Yes, the  Lord  has chosen Zion,  desired it for a dwelling:  This is my resting place forever;  here I will dwell, for I desire it.  I will bless Zion with provisions;  its poor I will fill with bread.  I will clothe its priests with salvation;  its devout shall shout for joy.   There I will make a horn sprout for David;    I will set a lamp for my anointed.  His foes I will clothe with shame,  but on him his crown shall shine.            '
