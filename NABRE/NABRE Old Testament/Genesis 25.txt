b'  Abrahams Sons by Keturah.      Abraham took another wife, whose name was Keturah.     She bore him Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah.       Jokshan became the father of Sheba and Dedan. The descendants of Dedan were the Asshurim, the Letushim, and the Leummim.       The descendants of Midian were Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abida, and Eldaah. All of these were descendants of Keturah.    Abraham gave everything that he owned to his son Isaac.       To the sons of his concubines, however, he gave gifts while he was still living, as he sent them away eastward, to the land of Kedem,   away from his son Isaac.   Death of Abraham.    The whole span of Abrahams life was one hundred and seventy-five years.     Then he breathed his last, dying at a ripe old age, grown old after a full life; and he was gathered to his people.     His sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron, son of Zohar the Hittite, which faces Mamre,       the field that Abraham had bought from the Hittites; there he was buried next to his wife Sarah.     After the death of Abraham, God blessed his son Isaac, who lived near Beer-lahai-roi.   Descendants of Ishmael.     These are the descendants of Abrahams son Ishmael, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarahs slave, bore to Abraham.      These are the names of Ishmaels sons, listed in the order of their birth: Ishmaels firstborn Nebaioth, Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam,       Mishma, Dumah, Massa,     Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah.     These are the sons of Ishmael, their names by their villages and encampments; twelve chieftains of as many tribal groups.     The span of Ishmaels life was one hundred and thirty-seven years. After he had breathed his last and died, he was gathered to his people.     The Ishmaelites ranged from Havilah, by Shur, which is on the border of Egypt, all the way to Asshur; and they pitched camp   alongside their various kindred.    Birth of Esau and Jacob.     These are the descendants of Isaac, son of Abraham; Abraham begot Isaac.     Isaac was forty years old when he married Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel the Aramean of Paddan-aram   and the sister of Laban the Aramean.       Isaac entreated the  Lord  on behalf of his wife, since she was sterile. The  Lord  heard his entreaty, and his wife Rebekah became pregnant.     But the children jostled each other in the womb so much that she exclaimed, If it is like this,   why go on living! She went to consult the  Lord ,     and the  Lord  answered her: Two nations are in your womb,  two peoples are separating while still within you; But one will be stronger than the other,  and the older will serve the younger.      When the time of her delivery came, there were twins in her womb.       The first to emerge was reddish,   and his whole body was like a hairy mantle; so they named him Esau.     Next his brother came out, gripping Esaus heel;   so he was named Jacob. Isaac was sixty years old when they were born.     When the boys grew up, Esau became a skillful hunter, a man of the open country; whereas Jacob was a simple   man, who stayed among the tents.       Isaac preferred Esau, because he was fond of game; but Rebekah preferred Jacob.     Once, when Jacob was cooking a stew, Esau came in from the open country, famished.     He said to Jacob, Let me gulp down some of that red stuff;   I am famished. That is why he was called Edom.     But Jacob replied, First sell me your right as firstborn.        Look, said Esau, I am on the point of dying. What good is the right as firstborn to me?     But Jacob said, Swear to me first! So he sold Jacob his right as firstborn under oath.       Jacob then gave him some bread and the lentil stew; and Esau ate, drank, got up, and went his way. So Esau treated his right as firstborn with disdain.            '
