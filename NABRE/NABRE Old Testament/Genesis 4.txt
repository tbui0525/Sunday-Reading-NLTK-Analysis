b'  Cain and Abel.    The man had intercourse with his wife Eve, and she conceived and gave birth to Cain, saying, I have produced a male child with the help of the  Lord .       Next she gave birth to his brother Abel. Abel became a herder of flocks, and Cain a tiller of the ground.       In the course of time Cain brought an offering to the  Lord  from the fruit of the ground,     while Abel, for his part, brought the fatty portion   of the firstlings of his flock.   The  Lord  looked with favor on Abel and his offering,     but on Cain and his offering he did not look with favor. So Cain was very angry and dejected.     Then the  Lord  said to Cain: Why are you angry? Why are you dejected?     If you act rightly, you will be accepted;   but if not, sin lies in wait at the door: its urge is for you, yet you can rule over it.     Cain said to his brother Abel, Let us go out in the field.   When they were in the field, Cain attacked his brother Abel and killed him.       Then the  Lord  asked Cain, Where is your brother Abel? He answered, I do not know. Am I my brothers keeper?     God then said: What have you done? Your brothers blood cries out to me from the ground!     Now you are banned from the ground   that opened its mouth to receive your brothers blood from your hand.       If you till the ground, it shall no longer give you its produce. You shall become a constant wanderer on the earth.     Cain said to the  Lord : My punishment is too great to bear.     Look, you have now banished me from the ground. I must avoid you and be a constant wanderer on the earth. Anyone may kill me at sight.     Not so! the  Lord  said to him. If anyone kills Cain, Cain shall be avenged seven times. So the  Lord  put a mark   on Cain, so that no one would kill him at sight.     Cain then left the  Lord s presence and settled in the land of Nod,   east of Eden.   Descendants of Cain and Seth.     Cain had intercourse with his wife, and she conceived and bore Enoch. Cain also became the founder of a city, which he named after his son Enoch.     To Enoch was born Irad, and Irad became the father of Mehujael; Mehujael became the father of Methusael, and Methusael became the father of Lamech.     Lamech took two wives; the name of the first was Adah, and the name of the second Zillah.     Adah gave birth to Jabal, who became the ancestor of those who dwell in tents and keep livestock.     His brothers name was Jubal, who became the ancestor of all who play the lyre and the reed pipe.     Zillah, on her part, gave birth to Tubalcain, the ancestor of all who forge instruments of bronze and iron. The sister of Tubalcain was Naamah.      Lamech said to his wives: Adah and Zillah, hear my voice;  wives of Lamech, listen to my utterance: I have killed a man for wounding me,  a young man for bruising me.  If Cain is avenged seven times,  then Lamech seventy-seven times.     Adam again had intercourse with his wife, and she gave birth to a son whom she called Seth. God has granted me another offspring in place of Abel, she said, because Cain killed him.     To Seth, in turn, a son was born, and he named him Enosh. At that time people began to invoke the  Lord  by name.             '
