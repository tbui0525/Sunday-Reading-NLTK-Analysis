b' A Prayer in Distress  A psalm of David. Lord , hear my prayer;  in your faithfulness listen to my pleading;  answer me in your righteousness.  Do not enter into judgment with your servant;  before you no one can be just.   The enemy has pursued my soul;  he has crushed my life to the ground.  He has made me dwell in darkness  like those long dead.   My spirit is faint within me;  my heart despairs.   I remember the days of old;  I ponder all your deeds;  the works of your hands I recall.   I stretch out my hands toward you,  my soul to you like a parched land.  Selah  Hasten to answer me,  Lord ;  for my spirit fails me. Do not hide your face from me,  lest I become like those descending to the pit.   In the morning let me hear of your mercy,  for in you I trust. Show me the path I should walk,  for I entrust my life to you.   Rescue me,  Lord , from my foes,  for I seek refuge in you.  Teach me to do your will,  for you are my God. May your kind spirit guide me  on ground that is level.  For your names sake,  Lord , give me life;  in your righteousness lead my soul out of distress.  In your mercy put an end to my foes;  all those who are oppressing my soul,  for I am your servant.             '
