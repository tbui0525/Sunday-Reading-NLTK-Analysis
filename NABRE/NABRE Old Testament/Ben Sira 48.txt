b'   Until like fire a prophet appeared,  his words a flaming furnace.   The staff of life, their bread, he shattered,  and in his zeal he made them few in number.  By Gods word he shut up the heavens  and three times brought down fire.   How awesome are you,  Elijah !  Whose glory is equal to yours?  You brought a dead body back to life  from Sheol, by the will of the  Lord .   You sent kings down to destruction,  and nobles, from their beds of sickness.   You heard threats at Sinai,  at Horeb avenging judgments.   You anointed the agent of these punishments,  the prophet to succeed in your place.   You were taken aloft in a whirlwind,  in a chariot with fiery horses.   You are destined, it is written, in time to come  to put an end to wrath before the day of the  Lord , To turn back the hearts of parents toward their children,  and to re-establish the tribes of Israel.   Blessed is the one who shall have seen you before he dies!      When Elijah was enveloped in the whirlwind, Elisha  was filled with his spirit;  He worked twice as many marvels,   and every utterance of his mouth was wonderful. During his lifetime he feared no one,  nor was anyone able to intimidate his will.  Nothing was beyond his power;   and from where he lay buried, his body prophesied.   In life he performed wonders,  and after death, marvelous deeds.  Despite all this the people did not repent,  nor did they give up their sins, Until they were uprooted from their land  and scattered all over the earth. Judah But Judah remained, a tiny people,  with its ruler from the house of David.   Some of them did what was right,  but others were extremely sinful.   Hezekiah and Isaiah   Hezekiah  fortified his city  and had water brought into it;  With bronze tools he cut through the rocks  and dammed up a mountain site for water.   During his reign Sennacherib led an invasion  and sent his adjutant; He shook his fist at Zion  and blasphemed God in his pride.   The peoples hearts melted within them,  and they were in anguish like that of childbirth.  But they called upon the Most High God  and lifted up their hands to him; He heard the prayer they uttered,  and saved them through  Isaiah .   God struck the camp of the Assyrians  and routed them with a plague.   For Hezekiah did what was right  and held fast to the paths of David, As ordered by the illustrious prophet  Isaiah, who saw truth in visions.  In his lifetime he turned back the sun  and prolonged the life of the king.   By his powerful spirit he looked into the future   and consoled the mourners of Zion;  He foretold what would happen till the end of time,  hidden things yet to be fulfilled.            '
