b'  A Prayer for Gods People   Come to our aid, O God of the universe,   and put all the nations in dread of you!  Raise your hand against the foreign people,  that they may see your mighty deeds.  As you have used us to show them your holiness,   so now use them to show us your glory.  Thus they will know, as we know,  that there is no God but you.    Give new signs and work new wonders;   show forth the splendor of your right hand and arm.  Rouse your anger, pour out wrath;   humble the enemy, scatter the foe.   Hasten the ending, appoint the time,  and let people proclaim your mighty deeds.  Let raging fire consume the fugitive,  and your peoples oppressors meet destruction.  Crush the heads of the hostile rulers  who say, There is no one besides me.    Gather all the tribes of Jacob,    that they may inherit the land as in days of old.

Reward those who have hoped in you,  and let your prophets be proved true.  Hear the prayer of your servants,  according to your good will toward your people. Thus all the ends of the earth will know  that you are the eternal God.   Choice of Associates   The throat can swallow any food,  yet some foods are more agreeable than others.

A woman will accept any man as husband,  but one woman will be preferable to another.  A womans beauty makes her husbands face light up,  for it surpasses all else that delights the eye.   And if, besides, her speech is soothing,  her husbands lot is beyond that of mortal men.  A wife is her husbands richest treasure,  a help like himself and a staunch support.   A vineyard with no hedge will be overrun;  and a man with no wife becomes a homeless wanderer.  Who will trust an armed band  that shifts from city to city? Or a man who has no nest,  who lodges wherever night overtakes him?             '
