b' The Lord of Majesty Acclaimed as King of the World  A psalm of David. I Give to the  Lord , you sons of God,   give to the  Lord  glory and might;  Give to the  Lord  the glory due his name.  Bow down before the  Lord s holy splendor!    II  The voice of the  Lord   is over the waters;  the God of glory thunders,  the  Lord , over the mighty waters.  The voice of the  Lord  is power;  the voice of the  Lord  is splendor.   The voice of the  Lord  cracks the cedars;  the  Lord  splinters the cedars of Lebanon,  Makes Lebanon leap like a calf,  and Sirion   like a young bull.  The voice of the  Lord  strikes with fiery flame;   the voice of the  Lord  shakes the desert;  the  Lord  shakes the desert of Kadesh.   The voice of the  Lord  makes the deer dance  and strips the forests bare.  All in his Temple say, Glory!   III  The  Lord  sits enthroned above the flood!    The  Lord  reigns as king forever!  May the  Lord  give might to his people;   may the  Lord  bless his people with peace!             '
