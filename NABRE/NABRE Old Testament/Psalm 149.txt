b' Praise God with Song and Sword  Hallelujah! Sing to the  Lord  a new song,  his praise in the assembly of the faithful.   Let Israel be glad in its maker,  the people of Zion rejoice in their king.  Let them praise his name in dance,  make music with tambourine and lyre.    For the  Lord  takes delight in his people,  honors the poor with victory.  Let the faithful rejoice in their glory,  cry out for joy on their couches,   With the praise of God in their mouths,  and a two-edged sword in their hands,   To bring retribution on the nations,  punishment on the peoples,   To bind their kings in shackles,  their nobles in chains of iron,  To execute the judgments decreed for them\xe2\x80\x94  such is the glory   of all Gods faithful. Hallelujah!            '
