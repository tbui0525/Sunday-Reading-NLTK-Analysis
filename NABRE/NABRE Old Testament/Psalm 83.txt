b' Prayer Against a Hostile Alliance  A song; a psalm of Asaph.   I  God, do not be silent;  God, do not be deaf or remain unmoved!   See how your enemies rage;  your foes proudly raise their heads.  They conspire against your people,  plot against those you protect.   They say, Come, let us wipe them out as a nation;  let Israels name be remembered no more!  They scheme with one mind,  they have entered into a covenant against you:    The tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites,  of Moab and the Hagrites,   Gebal, Ammon, and Amalek,   Philistia and the inhabitants of Tyre.   Assyria, too, in league with them,  backs the descendants of Lot. Selah   II   Deal with them as with Midian;  as with Sisera and Jabin at the wadi Kishon,   Those destroyed at Endor,  who became dung for the ground.   Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb,  all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna,  Who made a plan together,  Let us take for ourselves the pastures of God.  My God, make them like tumbleweed,  into chaff flying before the wind.   As a fire raging through a forest,  a flame setting mountains ablaze,   Pursue them with your tempest;  terrify them with your storm-wind.  Cover their faces with shame,  till they seek your name,    Lord .  Let them be ashamed and terrified forever;  let them perish in disgrace.  Let them know that your name is  Lord ,  you alone are the Most High over all the earth.             '
