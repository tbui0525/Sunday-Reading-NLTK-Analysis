b' A Pilgrims Prayer for Jerusalem  A song of ascents. Of David. I I rejoiced when they said to me,  Let us go to the house of the  Lord .   And now our feet are standing  within your gates, Jerusalem.  Jerusalem, built as a city,  walled round about.    There the tribes go up,  the tribes of the  Lord , As it was decreed for Israel,  to give thanks to the name of the  Lord .   There are the thrones of justice,  the thrones of the house of David.   II  For the peace of Jerusalem pray:  May those who love you prosper!  May peace be within your ramparts,  prosperity within your towers.   For the sake of my brothers and friends I say,  Peace be with you.   For the sake of the house of the  Lord , our God,  I pray for your good.            '
