b'  The Hidden Counsels of God   The souls of the righteous are in the hand of God,   and no torment shall touch them.  They seemed, in the view of the foolish, to be dead;  and their passing away was thought an affliction   and their going forth from us, utter destruction. But they are in peace.   For if to others, indeed, they seem punished,  yet is their hope full of immortality;  Chastised a little, they shall be greatly blessed,  because God tried them  and found them worthy of himself.   As gold in the furnace, he proved them,  and as sacrificial offerings   he took them to himself.   In the time of their judgment   they shall shine  and dart about as sparks through stubble;   They shall judge nations and rule over peoples,  and the  Lord  shall be their King forever.   Those who trust in him shall understand truth,  and the faithful shall abide with him in love: Because grace and mercy are with his holy ones,   and his care is with the elect.  But the wicked shall receive a punishment to match their thoughts,   since they neglected righteousness and forsook the  Lord .  For those who despise wisdom and instruction are doomed.  Vain is their hope, fruitless their labors,  and worthless their works.   Their wives are foolish and their children wicked,  accursed their brood.    B. On Childlessness   Yes, blessed is she who, childless and undefiled,  never knew transgression of the marriage bed;  for she shall bear fruit at the judgment of souls.   So also the eunuch whose hand wrought no misdeed,  who held no wicked thoughts against the  Lord \xe2\x80\x94 For he shall be given fidelitys choice reward   and a more gratifying heritage in the  Lord s temple.   For the fruit of noble struggles is a glorious one;  and unfailing is the root of understanding.    But the children of adulterers   will remain without issue,  and the progeny of an unlawful bed will disappear.   For should they attain long life, they will be held in no esteem,  and dishonored will their old age be in the end;  Should they die abruptly, they will have no hope  nor comfort in the day of scrutiny;   for dire is the end of the wicked generation.
