b'  Jobs First Reply.    Then Job answered and said:    Ah, could my anguish but be measured  and my calamity laid with it in the scales,  They would now outweigh the sands of the sea!  Because of this I speak without restraint.  For the arrows of the Almighty are in me,   and my spirit drinks in their poison;  the terrors of God are arrayed against me.  Does the wild donkey bray when it has grass?   Does the ox low over its fodder?  Can anything insipid be eaten without salt?  Is there flavor in the white of an egg?  I refuse to touch them;  they are like loathsome food to me.  Oh, that I might have my request,  and that God would grant what I long for:  Even that God would decide to crush me,  that he would put forth his hand and cut me off!  Then I should still have consolation  and could exult through unremitting pain,  because I have not transgressed the commands of the Holy One.  What strength have I that I should endure,  and what is my limit that I should be patient?  Have I the strength of stones,  or is my flesh of bronze?

It is thus that you have now become for me;   you see a terrifying thing and are afraid.  Have I said, Give me something,  make a bribe on my behalf from your possessions?  Or Deliver me from the hand of the enemy,  redeem me from oppressors?  Teach me, and I will be silent;  make me understand how I have erred.  How painful honest words can be;  yet how unconvincing is your argument!  Do you consider your words as proof,  but the sayings of a desperate man as wind?  You would even cast lots for the orphan,  and would barter over your friend!  Come, now, give me your attention;  surely I will not lie to your face.  Think it over; let there be no injustice.  Think it over; I still am right.  Is there insincerity on my tongue,  or cannot my taste discern falsehood?            '
