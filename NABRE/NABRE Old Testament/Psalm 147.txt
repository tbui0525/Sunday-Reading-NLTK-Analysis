b' Gods Word Restores Jerusalem  Hallelujah! I How good to sing praise to our God;  how pleasant to give fitting praise.   The  Lord  rebuilds Jerusalem,  and gathers the dispersed of Israel,   Healing the brokenhearted,  and binding up their wounds.   He numbers the stars,  and gives to all of them their names.   Great is our Lord, vast in power,  with wisdom beyond measure.   The  Lord  gives aid to the poor,  but casts the wicked to the ground.    II  Sing to the  Lord  with thanksgiving;  with the lyre make music to our God,    Who covers the heavens with clouds,  provides rain for the earth,  makes grass sprout on the mountains,   Who gives animals their food  and young ravens what they cry for.    He takes no delight in the strength of horses,  no pleasure in the runners stride.   Rather the  Lord  takes pleasure in those who fear him,  those who put their hope in his mercy.   III  Glorify the  Lord , Jerusalem;  Zion, offer praise to your God,  For he has strengthened the bars of your gates,  blessed your children within you.   He brings peace to your borders,  and satisfies you with finest wheat.    He sends his command to earth;  his word runs swiftly!   Thus he makes the snow like wool,  and spreads the frost like ash;   He disperses hail like crumbs.  Who can withstand his cold?  Yet when again he issues his command, it melts them;  he raises his winds and the waters flow.  He proclaims his word to Jacob,  his statutes and laws to Israel.   He has not done this for any other nation;  of such laws they know nothing. Hallelujah!            '
