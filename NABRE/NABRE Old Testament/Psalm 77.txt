b' Confidence in God During National Distress  For the leader; According to  Jeduthun . A psalm of Asaph.   I  I cry aloud to God,  I cry to God to hear me.  On the day of my distress I seek the Lord;  by night my hands are stretched out unceasingly;   I refuse to be consoled.  When I think of God, I groan;  as I meditate, my spirit grows faint.

Through the sea was your way;  your path, through the mighty waters,  though your footsteps were unseen.   You led your people like a flock  by the hand of Moses and Aaron.             '
