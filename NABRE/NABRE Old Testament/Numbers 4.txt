This is the task of the Kohathites in the tent of meeting: the most sacred objects.     In breaking camp, Aaron and his sons shall go in and take down the screening curtain   and cover the ark of the covenant with it.     Over these they shall put a cover of yellow-orange skin, and on top of this spread an all-violet cloth and put the poles in place.     On the table of the Presence they shall spread a violet cloth and put on it the plates and cups, as well as the bowls and pitchers for libations; the established bread offering shall remain on the table.

The  Lord  said to Moses and Aaron:     Do not let the group of Kohathite clans perish from among the Levites.     That they may live and not die when they approach the most sacred objects, this is what you shall do for them: Aaron and his sons shall go in and assign to each of them his task and what he must carry;     but the Kohathites shall not go in to look upon the sacred objects even for an instant, or they will die.     The  Lord  said to Moses:     Take a census of the Gershonites also, by ancestral houses and clans,     enrolling all between thirty and fifty years of age who will join the personnel to do the work in the tent of meeting.     This is the task of the clans of the Gershonites, what they must do and what they must carry:     they shall carry the curtains of the tabernacle, the tent of meeting with its covering and the outer wrapping of yellow-orange skin, the curtain at the entrance of the tent of meeting,     the hangings of the court, the curtain at the entrance to the gate of the court that encloses both the tabernacle and the altar, together with their ropes and all other objects necessary for their use. Whatever is to be done to maintain these things, they shall do.     The service of the Gershonites shall be entirely under the direction of Aaron and his sons, with regard to what they must carry and what they must do; you shall list for them by name what they are to carry.

The Merarites, too, you shall enroll by clans and ancestral houses,     enrolling all between thirty and fifty years of age who will join the personnel to maintain the tent of meeting.
