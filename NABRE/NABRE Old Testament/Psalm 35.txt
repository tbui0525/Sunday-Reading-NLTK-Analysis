b' Prayer for Help Against Unjust Enemies  Of David. I  Oppose, O  Lord , those who oppose me;  war upon those who make war upon me.  Take up the shield and buckler;  rise up in my defense.  Brandish lance and battle-ax  against my pursuers. Say to my soul,  I am your salvation.  Let those who seek my life  be put to shame and disgrace. Let those who plot evil against me   be turned back and confounded.  Make them like chaff before the wind,   with the angel of the  Lord  driving them on.  Make their way slippery and dark,  with the angel of the  Lord  pursuing them.   II  Without cause they set their snare for me;  without cause they dug a pit for me.  Let ruin overtake them unawares;  let the snare they have set catch them;  let them fall into the pit they have dug.   Then I will rejoice in the  Lord ,  exult in Gods salvation.  My very bones shall say,  O  Lord , who is like you,  Who rescue the afflicted from the powerful,  the afflicted and needy from the despoiler?   III  Malicious witnesses rise up,  accuse me of things I do not know.  They repay me evil for good;  my soul is desolate.    Yet I, when they were ill, put on sackcloth,  afflicted myself with fasting,  sobbed my prayers upon my bosom.  I went about in grief as for my brother,  bent in mourning as for my mother.  Yet when I stumbled they gathered with glee,  gathered against me and I did not know it. They slandered me without ceasing;   without respect they mocked me,  gnashed their teeth against me.   IV  O Lord, how long will you look on?  Restore my soul from their destruction,  my very life from lions!   Then I will thank you in the great assembly;  I will praise you before the mighty throng.   Do not let lying foes rejoice over me,  my undeserved enemies wink knowingly.   They speak no words of peace,  but against the quiet in the land  they fashion deceitful speech.   They open wide their mouths against me.  They say, Aha! Good!  Our eyes have seen it!   You see this,  Lord ; do not be silent;   Lord, do not withdraw from me.  Awake, be vigilant in my defense,  in my cause, my God and my Lord.  Defend me because you are just,  Lord ;  my God, do not let them rejoice over me.  Do not let them say in their hearts,  Aha! Our soul!  Do not let them say,  We have devoured that one!  Put to shame and confound  all who relish my misfortune. Clothe with shame and disgrace  those who lord it over me.  But let those who favor my just cause  shout for joy and be glad. May they ever say, Exalted be the  Lord  who delights in the peace of his loyal servant.  Then my tongue shall recount your justice,  declare your praise, all the day long.             '
