b'   The wisdom of the poor lifts their head high  and sets them among princes.  Do not praise anyone for good looks;  or despise anyone because of appearance.    The bee is least among winged creatures,  but it reaps the choicest of harvests.  Do not mock the one who wears only a loin-cloth,  or scoff at a persons bitter day. For strange are the deeds of the  Lord ,  hidden from mortals his work.   Many are the oppressed who rise to the throne;  some that none would consider wear a crown.   Many are the exalted who fall into utter disgrace,  many the honored who are given into the power of the few.   Moderation and Patience   Before investigating, do not find fault;  examine first, then criticize.  Before listening, do not say a word,  interrupt no one in the midst of speaking.   Do not dispute about what is not your concern;  in the quarrels of the arrogant do not take part.    My son, why increase your anxiety,  since whoever is greedy for wealth will not be blameless? Even if you chase after it, you will never overtake it;  and by fleeing you will not escape.  One may work and struggle and drive,  and fall short all the same.   Others go their way broken-down drifters,  with little strength and great misery\xe2\x80\x94 Yet the eye of the  Lord  looks favorably upon them,  shaking them free of the stinking mire.  He lifts up their heads and exalts them  to the amazement of the many.     Good and evil, life and death,   poverty and riches\xe2\x80\x94all are from the  Lord .   The Lords gift remains with the devout;  his favor brings lasting success.  Some become rich through a misers life,  and this is their allotted reward:  When they say: I have found rest,   now I will feast on my goods, They do not know how long it will be  till they die and leave them to others.     My child, stand by your agreement and attend to it,  grow old while doing your work.  Do not marvel at the works of a sinner,  but trust in the  Lord  and wait for his light; For it is easy in the eyes of the  Lord  suddenly, in an instant, to make the poor rich.    Gods blessing is the lot of the righteous,  and in due time their hope bears fruit.  Do not say: What do I need?  What further benefits can be mine?  Do not say: I am self-sufficient.  What harm can come to me now?  The day of prosperity makes one forget adversity;  the day of adversity makes one forget prosperity.     For it is easy for the Lord on the day of death   to repay mortals according to their conduct.  A time of affliction brings forgetfulness of past delights;  at the end of life ones deeds are revealed.  Call none happy before death,  for how they end, they are known.   Care in Choosing Friends  Not everyone should be brought into your house,  for many are the snares of the crafty.  Like a decoy partridge in a cage, so is the heart of the proud,  and like a spy they will pick out the weak spots.  For they lie in wait to turn good into evil,  and to praiseworthy deeds they attach blame.  One spark kindles many coals;  a sinner lies in wait for blood.  Beware of scoundrels, for they breed only evil,  and they may give you a lasting stain.  Admit strangers into your home, and they will stir up trouble  and make you a stranger to your own family.            '
