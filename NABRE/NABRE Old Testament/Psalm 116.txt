b' Thanksgiving to God Who Saves from Death I  I love the  Lord , who listened  to my voice in supplication,  Who turned an ear to me  on the day I called.  I was caught by the cords of death;    the snares of Sheol had seized me;  I felt agony and dread.  Then I called on the name of the  Lord ,  O  Lord , save my life!   II  Gracious is the  Lord  and righteous;  yes, our God is merciful.   The  Lord  protects the simple;  I was helpless, but he saved me.  Return, my soul, to your rest;  the  Lord  has been very good to you.   For my soul has been freed from death,  my eyes from tears, my feet from stumbling.   I shall walk before the  Lord  in the land of the living.     III   I kept faith, even when I said,  I am greatly afflicted!   I said in my alarm,  All men are liars!   How can I repay the  Lord  for all the great good done for me?  I will raise the cup of salvation   and call on the name of the  Lord .  I will pay my vows to the  Lord  in the presence of all his people.   Dear in the eyes of the  Lord  is the death of his devoted.   Lord , I am your servant,  your servant, the child of your maidservant;   you have loosed my bonds.  I will offer a sacrifice of praise  and call on the name of the  Lord .   I will pay my vows to the  Lord   in the presence of all his people,  In the courts of the house of the  Lord ,  in your midst, O Jerusalem. Hallelujah!            '
