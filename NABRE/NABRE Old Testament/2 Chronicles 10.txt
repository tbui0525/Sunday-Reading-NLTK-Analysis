b'   Division of the Kingdom.     Rehoboam went to Shechem, where all Israel   had come to make him king.     When Jeroboam, son of Nebat, heard about it, he was in Egypt where he had fled from King Solomon; and he returned from Egypt.     They sent for him; Jeroboam and all Israel came and said to Rehoboam:     Your father put on us a heavy yoke. If you now lighten the harsh servitude and the heavy yoke your father imposed on us, we will be your servants.     He answered them, Come back to me in three days, and the people went away.    King Rehoboam asked advice of the elders who had been in his father Solomons service while he was still alive, and asked, How do you advise me to answer this people?     They replied, If you will deal kindly with this people and please them, giving them a favorable reply, they will be your servants forever.     But he ignored the advice the elders had given him and asked advice of the young men who had grown up with him and were in his service.     He said to them, What answer do you advise us to give this people, who have told me, Lighten the yoke your father imposed on us?     The young men who had grown up with him replied: This is what you must say to this people who have told you, Your father laid a heavy yoke on us; lighten it for us. You must say, My little finger is thicker than my fathers loins.     My father put a heavy yoke on you; I will make it heavier. My father beat you with whips; I will use scorpions!

Ignoring the advice the elders had given him, King Rehoboam gave the people a harsh answer.     He spoke to them as the young men had advised: My father laid a heavy yoke on you; I will make it heavier. My father beat you with whips; I will use scorpions.     The king did not listen to the people, for this turn of events was from God: the  Lord  fulfilled the word he had spoken through Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam, the son of Nebat.      When all Israel saw that the king did not listen to them, the people answered the king: What share have we in David?  We have no heritage in the son of Jesse. Everyone to your tents, Israel!  Now look to your own house, David! So all Israel went off to their tents,     but the Israelites who lived in the cities of Judah had Rehoboam as their king.     King Rehoboam then sent out Hadoram, who was in charge of the forced labor, but the Israelites stoned him to death. King Rehoboam, however, managed to mount his chariot and flee to Jerusalem.     And so Israel has been in rebellion against the house of David to this day.            '
