b' Threatened but Trusting  A psalm of David, when he fled from his son Absalom.     I  How many are my foes,  Lord !  How many rise against me!   How many say of me,  There is no salvation for him in God.  Selah  But you,  Lord , are a shield around me;  my glory, you keep my head high.    II  With my own voice I will call out to the  Lord ,  and he will answer me from his holy mountain. Selah  I lie down and I fall asleep,  [and] I will wake up, for the  Lord  sustains me.   I do not fear, then, thousands of people  arrayed against me on every side.   III  Arise,  Lord ! Save me, my God!  For you strike the cheekbone of all my foes;  you break the teeth of the wicked.   Salvation is from the  Lord !  May your blessing be upon your people!  Selah            '
