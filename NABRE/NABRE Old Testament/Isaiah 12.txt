b'  Song of Thanksgiving    On that day, you will say: I give you thanks, O  Lord ;  though you have been angry with me,  your anger has abated, and you have consoled me.  God indeed is my salvation;  I am confident and unafraid. For the  Lord  is my strength and my might,  and he has been my salvation.   With joy you will draw water  from the fountains of salvation,   And you will say on that day:  give thanks to the  Lord , acclaim his name; Among the nations make known his deeds,  proclaim how exalted is his name.   Sing praise to the  Lord  for he has done glorious things;  let this be known throughout all the earth.   Shout with exultation, City of Zion,  for great in your midst  is the Holy One of Israel!             '
