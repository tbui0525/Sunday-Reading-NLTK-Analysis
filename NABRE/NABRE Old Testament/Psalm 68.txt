b' The Exodus and Conquest, Pledge of Future Help  For the leader. A psalm of David; a song.   I   May God arise;  may his enemies be scattered;  may those who hate him flee before him.   As the smoke is dispersed, disperse them;  as wax is melted by fire,  so may the wicked perish before God.   Then the just will be glad;  they will rejoice before God;  they will celebrate with great joy.   II  Sing to God, praise his name;  exalt the rider of the clouds.  Rejoice before him  whose name is the  Lord .   Father of the fatherless, defender of widows  \xe2\x80\x94  God in his holy abode,  God gives a home to the forsaken,  who leads prisoners out to prosperity,  while rebels live in the desert.    III  God, when you went forth before your people,   when you marched through the desert, Selah  The earth quaked, the heavens poured,  before God, the One of Sinai,  before God, the God of Israel.  You poured abundant rains, God,  your inheritance was weak and you repaired it.  Your creatures dwelt in it;  you will establish it in your goodness for the poor, O God.   IV  The Lord announced:  Those bringing news are a great Army.   The kings of the armies are in desperate flight.  Every household will share the spoil,   though you lie down among the sheepfolds,   you shall be covered with silver as the wings of a dove,  her feathers bright as fine gold.  When the Almighty routs the kings there,  it will be as when snow fell on Zalmon.    V  You mountain of God, mountain of Bashan,  you rugged mountain, mountain of Bashan,  You rugged mountains, why look with envy  at the mountain   where God has chosen to dwell,  where the  Lord  resides forever?   Gods chariots were myriad, thousands upon thousands;  from Sinai the Lord entered the holy place.  You went up to its lofty height;  you took captives, received slaves as tribute,   even rebels, for the  Lord  God to dwell.   VI  Blessed be the Lord day by day,  God, our salvation, who carries us.  Selah  Our God is a God who saves;  escape from death is the  Lord  Gods.  God will crush the heads of his enemies,  the hairy scalp of the one who walks in sin.   The Lord has said:  Even from Bashan I will fetch them,  fetch them even from the depths of the sea.   You will wash your feet in your enemys blood;  the tongues of your dogs will lap it up.    VII   Your procession comes into view, O God,  your procession into the holy place, my God and king.  The singers go first, the harpists follow;  in their midst girls sound the timbrels.   In your choirs, bless God;  Lord , Israels fountain.  In the lead is Benjamin, few in number;  there the princes of Judah, a large throng,  the princes of Zebulun, the princes of Naphtali, too.    VIII  Summon again, O God, your power,  the divine power you once showed for us,  From your temple on behalf of Jerusalem,  that kings may bring you tribute.  Roar at the wild beast of the reeds,   the herd of mighty bulls, the calves of the peoples;  trampling those who lust after silver  scatter the peoples that delight in war.  Let bronze be brought from Egypt,   Ethiopia hurry its hands to God.    IX  You kingdoms of the earth, sing to God;   chant the praises of the Lord, Selah  Who rides the heights of the ancient heavens,  Who sends forth his voice as a mighty voice?  Confess the power of God,  whose majesty protects Israel,  whose power is in the sky.  Awesome is God in his holy place,  the God of Israel,  who gives power and strength to his people.  Blessed be God!            '
