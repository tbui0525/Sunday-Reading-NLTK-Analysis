b'  Mordecais Reward from the King.    That night the king, unable to sleep, asked that the chronicle of notable events be brought in. While this was being read to him,     the passage occurred in which Mordecai reported Bigthan and Teresh, two of the royal eunuchs who guarded the entrance, for seeking to assassinate King Ahasuerus.       The king asked, What was done to honor and exalt Mordecai for this? The kings attendants replied, Nothing was done for him.      Who is in the court? the king asked.

Mordecai then returned to the royal gate, while Haman hurried home grieving, with his head covered.       When he told his wife Zeresh and all his friends everything that had happened to him, his advisers and his wife Zeresh said to him, If Mordecai, before whom you are beginning to fall, is of Jewish ancestry, you will not prevail against him, but will surely be defeated by him.
