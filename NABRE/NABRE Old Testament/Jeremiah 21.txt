b'   Fate of Zedekiah and Jerusalem.    The word which came to Jeremiah from the  Lord  when King Zedekiah   sent Pashhur, son of Malchiah, and the priest Zephaniah, son of Maaseiah, to him with this request:     Inquire for us of the  Lord , because Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, is attacking us. Perhaps the  Lord  will act for us in accord with his wonderful works by making him withdraw from us.     But Jeremiah answered them: This is what you shall report to Zedekiah:     Thus says the  Lord , the God of Israel: I will turn against you the weapons with which you are fighting the king of Babylon and the Chaldeans who besiege you outside the walls. These weapons I will pile up in the midst of this city,       and I myself will fight against you with outstretched hand and mighty arm, in anger, wrath, and great rage!       I will strike down the inhabitants of this city, human being and beast; they shall die in a great pestilence.       After that\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the  Lord \xe2\x80\x94I will hand over Zedekiah, king of Judah, and his ministers and the people in this city who survive pestilence, sword, and famine, to Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, to their enemies and those who seek their lives. He shall strike them down with the edge of the sword, without quarter, without mercy or compassion.       And to this people you shall say: Thus says the  Lord : See, I am giving you a choice between the way to life and the way to death.       Whoever remains in this city shall die by the sword or famine or pestilence. But whoever leaves and surrenders to the Chaldeans who are besieging you shall live and escape with his life.     I have set my face against this city, for evil and not for good\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the  Lord . It shall be given into the power of the king of Babylon who shall set it on fire.    Oracles Regarding the Kings   To the royal house of Judah: Hear the word of the  Lord ,   house of David!  Thus says the  Lord : Each morning dispense justice,  rescue the oppressed from the hand of the oppressor, Or my fury will break out like fire  and burn with no one to quench it  because of your evil deeds.   Beware! I am against you, Ruler of the Valley,  Rock of the Plain  \xe2\x80\x94oracle of the  Lord . You say, Who will attack us,  who can storm our defenses?  I will punish you\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the  Lord \xe2\x80\x94  as your deeds deserve! I will kindle a fire in its forest   that shall devour all its surroundings.             '
