b'  Joys and Miseries of Life  A great anxiety has God allotted,   and a heavy yoke, to the children of Adam,  From the day they leave their mothers womb  until the day they return to the mother of all the living.   Troubled thoughts and fear of heart are theirs  and anxious foreboding until death.  Whether one sits on a lofty throne  or grovels in dust and ashes,  Whether one wears a splendid crown  or is clothed in the coarsest of garments\xe2\x80\x94  There is wrath and envy, trouble and dread,  terror of death, fury and strife. Even when one lies on his bed to rest,  his cares disturb his sleep at night.  So short is his rest it seems like none,  till in his dreams he struggles as he did by day, Troubled by the visions of his mind,  like a fugitive fleeing from the pursuer.  As he reaches safety, he wakes up,  astonished that there was nothing to fear.  To all flesh, human being and beast,  but for sinners seven times more,  Come plague and bloodshed, fiery heat and drought,  plunder and ruin, famine and death.   For the wicked evil was created,  and because of them destruction hastens.    All that is of earth returns to earth,  and what is from above returns above.   All that comes from bribes or injustice will be wiped out,  but loyalty remains forever.  Wealth from injustice is like a flooding wadi,  like a mighty stream with lightning and thunder,  Which, in its rising, rolls along the stones,  but suddenly, once and for all, comes to an end.   The offshoot of violence will not flourish,  for the root of the godless is on sheer rock.  They are like reeds on riverbanks,  withered before all other plants;  But goodness, like eternity, will never be cut off,  and righteousness endures forever.    Wealth or wages can make life sweet,   but better than either, finding a treasure.  A child or a city will preserve ones name,  but better than either, finding wisdom. Cattle and orchards make a person flourish;  but better than either, a devoted wife.   Wine and strong drink delight the soul,  but better than either, love of friends.   Flute and harp offer sweet melody,  but better than either, a pure tongue.  Grace and beauty delight the eye,  but better than either, the produce of the field.  A friend and a neighbor are timely guides,  but better than either, a sensible wife.  Relatives and helpers for times of stress;  but better than either, charity that rescues.  Gold and silver make ones way secure,  but better than either, sound judgment.  Wealth and vigor make the heart exult,  but better than either, fear of God. In the fear of the Lord there is no want;  whoever has it need seek no other support.  The fear of God is a paradise of blessings;  its canopy is over all that is glorious.     My son, do not live the life of a beggar;   better to die than to beg.  When one has to look to a strangers table,  life is not worth living. The delicacies offered bring revulsion of spirit,  and to the intelligent, inward torture.   In the mouth of the shameless begging is sweet,  but within him it burns like fire.            '
