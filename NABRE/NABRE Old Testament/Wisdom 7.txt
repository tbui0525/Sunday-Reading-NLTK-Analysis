b'  Solomon Is Like All Others  I too am a mortal, the same as all the rest,   and a descendant of the first one formed of earth.  And in my mothers womb I was molded into flesh   in a ten-month period  \xe2\x80\x94body and blood,  from the seed of a man, and the pleasure that accompanies marriage.  And I too, when born, inhaled the common air,  and fell upon the kindred earth;  wailing, I uttered that first sound common to all.  In swaddling clothes and with constant care I was nurtured.  For no king has any different origin or birth;   one is the entry into life for all,  and in one same way they leave it.    Solomon Prayed and Wisdom and Riches Came to Him  Therefore I prayed, and prudence was given me;  I pleaded and the spirit of Wisdom came to me.   I preferred her to scepter and throne,  And deemed riches nothing in comparison with her,   nor did I liken any priceless gem to her; Because all gold, in view of her, is a bit of sand,  and before her, silver is to be accounted mire.  Beyond health and beauty I loved her, And I chose to have her rather than the light,  because her radiance never ceases.   Yet all good things together came to me with her,   and countless riches at her hands;  I rejoiced in them all, because Wisdom is their leader,  though I had not known that she is their mother.     Solomon Prays for Help to Speak Worthily of Wisdom  Sincerely I learned about her, and ungrudgingly do I share\xe2\x80\x94  her riches I do not hide away;   For she is an unfailing treasure;  those who gain this treasure win the friendship of God,  being commended by the gifts that come from her discipline.   Now God grant I speak suitably  and value these endowments at their worth: For he is the guide of Wisdom  and the director of the wise.  For both we and our words are in his hand,  as well as all prudence and knowledge of crafts.    For he gave me sound knowledge of what exists,  that I might know the structure of the universe and the force of its elements,  The beginning and the end and the midpoint of times,  the changes in the suns course and the variations of the seasons,  Cycles of years, positions of stars,   natures of living things, tempers of beasts, Powers of the winds and thoughts of human beings,  uses of plants and virtues of roots\xe2\x80\x94  Whatever is hidden or plain I learned,   for Wisdom, the artisan of all, taught me.  Nature and Incomparable Dignity of Wisdom   For in her is a spirit  intelligent, holy, unique, Manifold, subtle, agile,  clear, unstained, certain, Never harmful, loving the good, keen,    unhampered, beneficent, kindly, Firm, secure, tranquil,  all-powerful, all-seeing, And pervading all spirits,  though they be intelligent, pure and very subtle.    For Wisdom is mobile beyond all motion,  and she penetrates and pervades all things by reason of her purity.    For she is a breath of the might of God  and a pure emanation of the glory of the Almighty;  therefore nothing defiled can enter into her.  For she is the reflection of eternal light,  the spotless mirror of the power of God,  the image of his goodness.   Although she is one, she can do all things,  and she renews everything while herself perduring; Passing into holy souls from age to age,  she produces friends of God and prophets.   For God loves nothing so much as the one who dwells with Wisdom.  For she is fairer than the sun   and surpasses every constellation of the stars. Compared to light, she is found more radiant;   though night supplants light,  wickedness does not prevail over Wisdom.            '
