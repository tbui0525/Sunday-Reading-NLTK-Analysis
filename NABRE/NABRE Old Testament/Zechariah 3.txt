b'  Prophetic Vision: Joshua the High Priest.    Then he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the  Lord , while the adversary   stood at his right side to accuse him.       And the angel of the  Lord  said to the adversary, May the  Lord  rebuke you, O adversary; may the  Lord  who has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you!   Is this not a brand plucked from the fire?      Now Joshua was standing before the angel, clad in filthy garments.     Then the angel said to those standing before him, Remove his filthy garments.   And to him he said, Look, I have taken your guilt from you,   and I am clothing you in stately robes.     Then he said, Let them put a clean turban on his head. And they put a clean turban on his head and clothed him with the garments while the angel of the  Lord  was standing by.     Then the angel of the  Lord  charged Joshua:     Thus says the  Lord  of hosts: If you walk in my ways and carry out my charge, you will administer my house and watch over my courts;   and I will give you access to those standing here.
