b'  Capture of Jerusalem.    Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king; he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem.   His mothers name was Hamutal, daughter of Jeremiah from Libnah.     He did what was evil in the sight of the  Lord , just as Jehoiakim had done.     Indeed, the things done in Jerusalem and in Judah so angered the  Lord  that he cast them out from his presence. Thus Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.      In the tenth month of the ninth year of his reign, on the tenth day of the month,   Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, and his entire army advanced against Jerusalem, encamped around it, and built siege walls on every side.     The siege of the city continued until the eleventh year of King Zedekiah.    On the ninth day of the fourth month, when famine had gripped the city and the people had no more bread,     the city walls were breached. All the soldiers fled and left the city by night through the gate between the two walls which was near the kings garden. With the Chaldeans surrounding the city, they went in the direction of the Arabah.     But the Chaldean army pursued the king and overtook Zedekiah in the wilderness near Jericho; his whole army fled from him.    The king, therefore, was arrested and brought to Riblah, in the land of Hamath, to the king of Babylon, who pronounced judgment on him.     As Zedekiah looked on, the king of Babylon slaughtered his sons before his eyes! All the nobles of Judah were slaughtered at Riblah.     And the eyes of Zedekiah he then blinded, bound him with chains, and the king of Babylon brought him to Babylon and kept him in prison until the day he died.   Destruction of Jerusalem.    On the tenth day of the fifth month, this was in the nineteenth year   of Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, Nebuzaradan, captain of the bodyguard, came to Jerusalem as the representative of the king of Babylon.     He burned the house of the  Lord , the palace of the king, and all the houses of Jerusalem; every large building he destroyed with fire.     Then the Chaldean troops with the captain of the guard tore down all the walls that surrounded Jerusalem.    Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard, led into exile the remnant of people left in the city, those who had deserted to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the artisans.     But Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard, left behind some of the countrys poor as vinedressers and farmers.    The bronze pillars that belonged to the house of the  Lord , and the wheeled carts and the bronze sea in the house of the  Lord , the Chaldeans broke into pieces; they carried away all the bronze to Babylon.     They also took the pots, shovels, snuffers, bowls, pans, and all the bronze vessels used for service;     the basins, fire holders, bowls, pots, lampstands, pans, the sacrificial bowls made of gold or silver. Along with these furnishings the captain of the guard carried off     the two pillars, the one sea and its base of twelve oxen cast in bronze, and the wheeled carts King Solomon had commissioned for the house of the  Lord . The bronze from all these furnishings was impossible to weigh.    As for the pillars, each of them was eighteen cubits high and twelve cubits in diameter; each was four fingers thick and hollow inside.     A bronze capital five cubits high crowned the one pillar, and a network with pomegranates encircled the capital, all of bronze; and so for the other pillar, with pomegranates.     There were ninety-six pomegranates on the sides, a hundred pomegranates surrounding the network.    The captain of the guard also took Seraiah the high priest, Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the entrance.     From the city he took one courtier, a commander of soldiers, and seven men in the personal service of the king still in the city, the scribe of the army commander who mustered the people of the land, and sixty of the common people remaining in the city.     The captain of the guard, Nebuzaradan, arrested them and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah,     who had them struck down and executed in Riblah, in the land of Hamath. Thus Judah was exiled from the land.      This is the number of people Nebuchadnezzar led away captive: in his seventh year, three thousand twenty-three people of Judah;     in the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar, eight hundred thirty-two persons from Jerusalem;     in the twenty-third year of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard, deported seven hundred forty-five Judahites: four thousand six hundred persons in all. Favor Shown to Jehoiachin.        In the thirty-seventh year of the exile of Jehoiachin, king of Judah, on the twenty-fifth day of the twelfth month, Evil-merodach, king of Babylon, in the inaugural year of his reign, raised up Jehoiachin, king of Judah, and released him from prison.     He spoke kindly to him and gave him a throne higher than the thrones of the other kings   who were with him in Babylon.     Jehoiachin took off his prison garb and ate at the kings table as long as he lived.     The allowance given him by the king of Babylon was a perpetual allowance, in fixed daily amounts, all the days of his life until the day of his death.            '
