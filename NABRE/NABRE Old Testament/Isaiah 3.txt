b'  Judgment on Jerusalem and Judah   The Lord, the  Lord  of hosts,  will take away from Jerusalem and from Judah Support and staff\xe2\x80\x94  all support of bread,  all support of water:   Hero and warrior,  judge and prophet, diviner and elder,  The captain of fifty and the nobleman,  counselor, skilled magician, and expert charmer.  I will place boys as their princes;  the fickle will govern them,   And the people will oppress one another,  yes, each one the neighbor. The child will be insolent toward the elder,  and the base toward the honorable.   When anyone seizes a brother  in their fathers house, saying, You have clothes! Be our ruler,  and take in hand this ruin!\xe2\x80\x94   He will cry out in that day: I cannot be a healer,   when there is neither bread nor clothing in my own house!  You will not make me a ruler of the people!  Jerusalem has stumbled, Judah has fallen;  for their speech and deeds affront the  Lord ,  a provocation in the sight of his majesty.  Their very look bears witness against them;   they boast of their sin like Sodom,  They do not hide it.  Woe to them!  They deal out evil to themselves.  Happy the just, for it will go well with them,  the fruit of their works they will eat.  Woe to the wicked! It will go ill with them,  with the work of their hands they will be repaid.  My people\xe2\x80\x94infants oppress them,  women rule over them! My people, your leaders deceive you,   they confuse the paths you should follow.     The  Lord  rises to accuse,  stands to try his people.  The Lord enters into judgment  with the peoples elders and princes: You, you who have devoured the vineyard;  the loot wrested from the poor is in your houses.  What do you mean by crushing my people,  and grinding down the faces of the poor?  says the Lord, the  God  of hosts.   The Haughty Women of Zion   The  Lord  said:   Because the daughters of Zion are haughty,  and walk with necks outstretched, Ogling and mincing as they go,  their anklets tinkling with every step,  The Lord shall cover the scalps of Zions daughters with scabs,  and the  Lord  shall lay bare their heads.       On that day the  Lord  will do away with the finery of the anklets, sunbursts, and crescents;     the pendants, bracelets, and veils;     the headdresses, bangles, cinctures, perfume boxes, and amulets;     the signet rings, and the nose rings;     the court dresses, wraps, cloaks, and purses;     the lace gowns, linen tunics, turbans, and shawls.    Instead of perfume there will be stench,  instead of a girdle, a rope, And instead of elaborate coiffure, baldness;  instead of a rich gown, a sackcloth skirt. Then, instead of beauty, shame.  Your men will fall by the sword,  and your champions,   in war;   Her gates will lament and mourn,  as the city sits desolate on the ground.             '
