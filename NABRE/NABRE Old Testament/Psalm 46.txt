b' God, the Protector of Zion  For the leader. A song of the Korahites. According to  alamoth .    I  God is our refuge and our strength,  an ever-present help in distress.    Thus we do not fear, though earth be shaken  and mountains quake to the depths of the sea,  Though its waters rage and foam  and mountains totter at its surging.  Selah   II   Streams of the river gladden the city of God,  the holy dwelling of the Most High.   God is in its midst; it shall not be shaken;  God will help it at break of day.   Though nations rage and kingdoms totter,  he utters his voice and the earth melts.    The  Lord  of hosts is with us;  our stronghold is the God of Jacob. Selah   III  Come and see the works of the  Lord ,  who has done fearsome deeds on earth;   Who stops wars to the ends of the earth,  breaks the bow, splinters the spear,  and burns the shields with fire;    Be still and know that I am God!  I am exalted among the nations,  exalted on the earth.  The  Lord  of hosts is with us;  our stronghold is the God of Jacob. Selah            '
