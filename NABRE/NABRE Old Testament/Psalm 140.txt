b' Prayer for Deliverance from the Wicked  For the leader. A psalm of David.   I  Deliver me,  Lord , from the wicked;  preserve me from the violent,   From those who plan evil in their hearts,  who stir up conflicts every day,   Who sharpen their tongue like a serpent,  venom of asps upon their lips.  Selah   II  Keep me,  Lord , from the clutches of the wicked;  preserve me from the violent,  who plot to trip me up.    The arrogant have set a trap for me;  they have spread out ropes for a net,  laid snares for me by the wayside. Selah  I say to the  Lord : You are my God;   listen,  Lord , to the words of my pleas.  Lord , my master, my strong deliverer,  you cover my head on the day of armed conflict.  Lord , do not grant the desires of the wicked one;  do not let his plot succeed. Selah   III  Those who surround me raise their heads;  may the mischief they threaten overwhelm them.  Drop burning coals upon them;   cast them into the watery pit never more to rise.    Slanderers will not survive on earth;  evil will hunt down the man of violence to overthrow him.  For I know the  Lord  will take up the cause of the needy,  justice for the poor.  Then the righteous will give thanks to your name;  the upright will dwell in your presence.             '
