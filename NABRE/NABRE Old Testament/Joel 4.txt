b'  The Lords Case Against the Nations  For see, in those days and at that time,   when I restore the fortunes  of Judah and Jerusalem,  I will gather all the nations  and bring them down to the Valley of Jehoshaphat.  There I will enter into judgment with them  on behalf of my people, my heritage, Israel; Because they scattered them among the nations,  they divided up my land.   For my people they cast lots,  trading a young boy for the price of a prostitute,  exchanging a young girl for the wine they drank.      Moreover, what are you doing to me, Tyre and Sidon, and all the regions of Philistia? Are you paying me back for something? If you are, I will very quickly turn your deeds back upon your own head.       You took my silver and my gold and brought my priceless treasures into your temples!     You sold the people of Judah and Jerusalem to the Greeks, taking them far from their own country!     Look! I am rousing them from the place to which you sold them, and I will turn your deeds back upon your own head.     I will sell your sons and daughters to the Judahites who will sell them to the Sabeans,   a distant nation. The  Lord  has spoken!   The Nations Destroyed  Announce this to the nations:  Proclaim a holy war!  Alert the warriors! Let all the soldiers  report and march!    Beat your plowshares into swords,  and your pruning knives into spears;  let the weakling boast, I am a warrior!     Hurry and come, all you neighboring peoples,  assemble there! Bring down,  Lord , your warriors!  Let the nations rouse themselves and come up  to the Valley of Jehoshaphat; For there I will sit in judgment  upon all the neighboring nations.    Wield the sickle,   for the harvest is ripe; Come and tread,  for the wine press is full; The vats overflow,  for their crimes are numerous.   Crowds upon crowds  in the Valley of Decision; For near is the day of the  Lord  in the Valley of Decision.   Sun and moon are darkened,  and the stars withhold their brightness,   The  Lord  roars from Zion,  and from Jerusalem raises his voice,  The heavens and the earth quake,  but the  Lord  will be a shelter for his people,  a fortress for the people of Israel.   A Secure Future for Judah  Then you will know   that I the  Lord  am your God,   dwelling on Zion, my holy mountain; Jerusalem will be holy,  and strangers will never again travel through her.   On that day  the mountains will drip new wine,  and the hills flow with milk, All the streams of Judah  will flow with water. A spring will rise from the house of the  Lord ,  watering the Valley of Shittim.   Egypt will be a waste,  Edom a desolate wilderness, Because of violence done to the Judahites,  because they shed innocent blood in their land.   But Judah will be inhabited forever,  and Jerusalem for all generations.  I will avenge their blood,  and I will not acquit the guilt.  The  Lord  dwells in Zion.            '
