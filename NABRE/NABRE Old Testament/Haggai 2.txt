b'  Assurance of Gods Presence.    On the twenty-first day of the seventh month,   the word of the  Lord  came through Haggai the prophet:     Speak to the governor of Judah, Zerubbabel, son of Shealtiel, and to the high priest Joshua, son of Jehozadak, and to the remnant of the people:    Who is left among you   who saw this house in its former glory? And how do you see it now?  Does it not seem like nothing in your eyes?   Now be strong, Zerubbabel\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the  Lord \xe2\x80\x94  be strong, Joshua, son of Jehozadak, high priest, Be strong, all you people of the land\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the  Lord \xe2\x80\x94  and work! For I am with you\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the  Lord  of hosts.  This is the commitment I made to you  when you came out of Egypt. My spirit remains in your midst;  do not fear!    For thus says the  Lord  of hosts:  In just a little while,  I will shake the heavens and the earth,   the sea and the dry land.  I will shake all the nations,  so that the treasures of all the nations will come in. And I will fill this house with glory\xe2\x80\x94  says the  Lord  of hosts.     Mine is the silver and mine the gold\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the  Lord  of hosts.    Greater will be the glory of this house   the latter more than the former\xe2\x80\x94says the  Lord  of hosts; And in this place I will give you peace\xe2\x80\x94   oracle of the  Lord  of hosts. Priestly Ruling with Prophetic Interpretation.       On the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month in the second year   of Darius, the word of the  Lord  came to Haggai the prophet:     Thus says the  Lord  of hosts: Ask the priests for a ruling:       If someone carries sanctified meat in the fold of a garment and the fold touches bread, soup, wine, oil, or any other food, do they become sanctified? No, the priests answered.     Then Haggai asked: If a person defiled from contact with a corpse touches any of these, do they become defiled? The priests answered, They become defiled.       Then Haggai replied: So is this people,   and so is this nation  in my sight\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the  Lord \xe2\x80\x94 And so is all the work of their hands;  what they offer there is defiled.    Now reflect,   from this day forward\xe2\x80\x94before you set stone to stone in the temple of the  Lord ,     what was your experience? When one went to a heap of grain for twenty ephahs,  there were only ten; When one went to a vat to draw fifty ephahs,   there were only twenty.   I struck you, and all the work of your hands,  with searing wind, blight, and hail,  yet you did not return to me\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the  Lord .     Reflect from this day forward, from the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month.   From the day on which the temple of the  Lord  was founded, reflect!    Is there still seed in the storehouse?  Have the vine, the fig, the pomegranate,  and the olive tree still not borne fruit? From this day, I will bless you.  Future Hope.       The word of the  Lord  came a second time to Haggai on the twenty-fourth day of the month:       Speak to Zerubbabel, the governor of Judah: I will shake the heavens and the earth;   I will overthrow the thrones of kingdoms,  and destroy the power of the kingdoms of the nations. I will overthrow the chariots and their riders,  and the riders with their horses  will fall by each others swords.     On that day\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the  Lord  of hosts\xe2\x80\x94I will take you, my servant, Zerubbabel, son of Shealtiel\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the  Lord \xe2\x80\x94and I will make you like a signet ring,   for I have chosen you\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the  Lord  of hosts.
