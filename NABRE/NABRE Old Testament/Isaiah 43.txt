b'  Promises of Redemption and Restoration  But now, thus says the  Lord ,  who created you, Jacob, and formed you, Israel: Do not fear, for I have redeemed you;  I have called you by name: you are mine.  When you pass through waters, I will be with you;  through rivers, you shall not be swept away. When you walk through fire, you shall not be burned,  nor will flames consume you.  For I, the  Lord , am your God,  the Holy One of Israel, your savior. I give Egypt as ransom for you,  Ethiopia and Seba   in exchange for you.  Because you are precious in my eyes  and honored, and I love you, I give people in return for you  and nations in exchange for your life.   Fear not, for I am with you;  from the east I will bring back your offspring,  from the west I will gather you.  I will say to the north: Give them up!  and to the south: Do not hold them! Bring back my sons from afar,  and my daughters from the ends of the earth:   All who are called by my name  I created for my glory;  I formed them, made them.  Lead out the people, blind though they have eyes,  deaf though they have ears.    Let all the nations gather together,  let the peoples assemble! Who among them could have declared this,  or announced to us the earlier things?  Let them produce witnesses to prove themselves right,  that one may hear and say, It is true!  You are my witnesses  \xe2\x80\x94oracle of the  Lord \xe2\x80\x94  my servant whom I have chosen To know and believe in me  and understand that I am he. Before me no god was formed,  and after me there shall be none.  I, I am the  Lord ;  there is no savior but me.  It is I who declared, who saved,  who announced, not some strange god among you; You are my witnesses\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the  Lord .  I am God,   yes, from eternity I am he; There is none who can deliver from my hand:  I act and who can cancel it?     Thus says the  Lord , your redeemer,   the Holy One of Israel: For your sake I send to Babylon;  I will bring down all her defenses,  and the Chaldeans shall cry out in lamentation.  I am the  Lord , your Holy One,  the creator of Israel, your King.  Thus says the  Lord ,  who opens a way in the sea,  a path in the mighty waters,   Who leads out chariots and horsemen,  a powerful army, Till they lie prostrate together, never to rise,  snuffed out, quenched like a wick.   Remember not   the events of the past,  the things of long ago consider not;  See, I am doing something new!  Now it springs forth, do you not perceive it? In the wilderness I make a way,  in the wasteland, rivers.  Wild beasts honor me,  jackals and ostriches, For I put water in the wilderness  and rivers in the wasteland  for my chosen people to drink,  The people whom I formed for myself,  that they might recount my praise.    Yet you did not call upon me, Jacob,   for you grew weary of me, Israel.  You did not bring me sheep for your burnt offerings,  nor honor me with your sacrifices. I did not exact from you the service of offerings,  nor weary you for frankincense.   You did not buy me sweet cane,   nor did you fill me with the fat of your sacrifices; Instead, you burdened me with your sins,  wearied me with your crimes.  It is I, I, who wipe out,  for my own sake, your offenses;  your sins I remember no more.  Would you have me remember, have us come to trial?  Speak up, prove your innocence!  Your first father   sinned;  your spokesmen rebelled against me  Till I repudiated the holy princes,  put Jacob under the ban,  exposed Israel to scorn.            '
