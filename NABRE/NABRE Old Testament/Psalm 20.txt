b' Prayer for the King in Time of War  For the leader. A psalm of David.   I  The  Lord  answer you in time of distress;  the name of the God of Jacob defend you!  May he send you help from the sanctuary,  from Zion be your support.   May he remember   your every offering,  graciously accept your burnt offering, Selah  Grant what is in your heart,  fulfill your every plan.  May we shout for joy at your victory,   raise the banners in the name of our God.  The  Lord  grant your every petition!   II  Now I know the  Lord  gives victory  to his anointed.  He will answer him from the holy heavens  with a strong arm that brings victory.  Some rely on chariots, others on horses,  but we on the name of the  Lord  our God.   They collapse and fall,  but we stand strong and firm.   Lord , grant victory to the king;  answer when we call upon you.            '
