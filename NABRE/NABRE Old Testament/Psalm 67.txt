b' Harvest Thanks and Petition  For the leader; with stringed instruments. A psalm; a song.   I  May God be gracious to us   and bless us;  may his face shine upon us.  Selah  So shall your way be known upon the earth,  your victory among all the nations.   May the peoples praise you, God;  may all the peoples praise you!   II  May the nations be glad and rejoice;  for you judge the peoples with fairness,  you guide the nations upon the earth.  Selah  May the peoples praise you, God;  may all the peoples praise you!   III  The earth has yielded its harvest;  God, our God, blesses us.   May God bless us still;  that the ends of the earth may revere him.            '
