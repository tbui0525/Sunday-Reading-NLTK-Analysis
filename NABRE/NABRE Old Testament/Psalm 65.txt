b' Thanksgiving for Gods Blessings  For the leader. A psalm of David. A song.   I  To you we owe our hymn of praise,  O God on Zion; To you our vows   must be fulfilled,    you who hear our prayers. To you all flesh must come    with its burden of wicked deeds. We are overcome by our sins;  only you can pardon them.   Blessed the one whom you will choose and bring  to dwell in your courts. May we be filled with the good things of your house,  your holy temple!   II  You answer us with awesome deeds   of justice,  O God our savior, The hope of all the ends of the earth  and of those far off across the sea.   You are robed in power,  you set up the mountains by your might.  You still the roaring of the seas,   the roaring of their waves,  the tumult of the peoples.   Distant peoples stand in awe of your marvels;  the places of morning and evening you make resound with joy.   You visit the earth and water it,  make it abundantly fertile.  Gods stream   is filled with water;  you supply their grain. Thus do you prepare it:   you drench its plowed furrows,  and level its ridges. With showers you keep it soft,  blessing its young sprouts.  You adorn the year with your bounty;  your paths   drip with fruitful rain.  The meadows of the wilderness also drip;  the hills are robed with joy.  The pastures are clothed with flocks,  the valleys blanketed with grain;  they cheer and sing for joy.             '
