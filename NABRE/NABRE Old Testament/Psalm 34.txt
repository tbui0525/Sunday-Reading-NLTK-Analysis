b' Thanksgiving to God Who Delivers the Just  Of David, when he feigned madness before Abimelech,   who drove him out and he went away.   I  I will bless the  Lord  at all times;  his praise shall be always in my mouth.   My soul will glory in the  Lord ;  let the poor hear and be glad.  Magnify the  Lord  with me;  and let us exalt his name together.   II  I sought the  Lord , and he answered me,  delivered me from all my fears.  Look to him and be radiant,  and your faces may not blush for shame.  This poor one cried out and the  Lord  heard,  and from all his distress he saved him.  The angel of the  Lord  encamps  around those who fear him, and he saves them.   Taste and see that the  Lord  is good;  blessed is the stalwart one who takes refuge in him.   Fear the  Lord , you his holy ones;  nothing is lacking to those who fear him.   The rich grow poor and go hungry,  but those who seek the  Lord  lack no good thing.   III  Come, children,   listen to me;   I will teach you fear of the  Lord .  Who is the man who delights in life,   who loves to see the good days?  Keep your tongue from evil,  your lips from speaking lies.  Turn from evil and do good;   seek peace and pursue it.  The eyes of the  Lord  are directed toward the righteous   and his ears toward their cry.  The  Lord s face is against evildoers  to wipe out their memory from the earth.  The righteous cry out, the  Lord  hears  and he rescues them from all their afflictions.  The  Lord  is close to the brokenhearted,  saves those whose spirit is crushed.  Many are the troubles of the righteous,  but the  Lord  delivers him from them all.  He watches over all his bones;  not one of them shall be broken.   Evil will slay the wicked;  those who hate the righteous are condemned.  The  Lord  is the redeemer of the souls of his servants;  and none are condemned who take refuge in him.            '
