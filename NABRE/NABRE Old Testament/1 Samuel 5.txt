b'  The Ark in the Temple of Dagon.      The Philistines, having captured the ark of God, transferred it from Ebenezer to Ashdod.       They then took the ark of God and brought it into the temple of Dagon, placing it beside Dagon.     When the people of Ashdod rose early the next morning, Dagon was lying face down on the ground before the ark of the  Lord . So they picked Dagon up and put him back in his place.
