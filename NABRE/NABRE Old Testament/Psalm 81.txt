b' An Admonition to Fidelity  For the leader; upon the  gittith .   Of Asaph.   I  Sing joyfully to God our strength;   raise loud shouts to the God of Jacob!  Take up a melody, sound the timbrel,  the pleasant lyre with a harp.   Blow the shofar at the new moon,  at the full moon, on our solemn feast.   For this is a law for Israel,  an edict of the God of Jacob,   He made it a decree for Joseph  when he came out of the land of Egypt.   II   I heard a tongue I did not know:  I removed his shoulder from the burden;   his hands moved away from the basket.   In distress you called and I rescued you;  I answered you in secret with thunder; At the waters of Meribah   I tested you:       Listen, my people, I will testify against you Selah  If only you will listen to me, Israel!   There shall be no foreign god among you;    you shall not bow down to an alien god.  I am the  Lord  your God,  who brought you up from the land of Egypt.  Open wide your mouth that I may fill it.  But my people did not listen to my words;  Israel would not submit to me.  So I thrust them away to the hardness of their heart;  Let them walk in their own machinations.   O that my people would listen to me,  that Israel would walk in my ways,   In a moment I would humble their foes,  and turn back my hand against their oppressors.   Those who hate the  Lord  will try flattering him,  but their fate is fixed forever.  But Israel I will feed with the finest wheat,  I will satisfy them with honey from the rock.             '
