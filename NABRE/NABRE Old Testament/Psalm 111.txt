b' Praise of God for Goodness to Israel  Hallelujah! I will praise the  Lord  with all my heart   in the assembled congregation of the upright.   Great are the works of the  Lord ,  studied by all who delight in them.  Majestic and glorious is his work,  his righteousness endures forever.  He won renown for his wondrous deeds;  gracious and merciful is the  Lord .   He gives food to those who fear him,   he remembers his covenant forever.  He showed his powerful deeds to his people,  giving them the inheritance of the nations.  The works of his hands are true and just,  reliable all his decrees,  Established forever and ever,  to be observed with truth and equity.  He sent release to his people,  decreed his covenant forever;  holy and fearsome is his name.   The fear of the  Lord  is the beginning of wisdom;   prudent are all who practice it.  His praise endures forever.            '
