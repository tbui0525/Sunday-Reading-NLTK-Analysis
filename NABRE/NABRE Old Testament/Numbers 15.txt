b'  Secondary Offerings.    The  Lord  spoke to Moses:      Speak to the Israelites and say to them: When you enter the land that I am giving you for your settlements,     if you make to the  Lord  an oblation from the herd or from the flock\xe2\x80\x94either a burnt offering or a sacrifice, to fulfill a vow, or as a voluntary offering, or for one of your festivals\xe2\x80\x94to produce a pleasing aroma for the  Lord ,     the one presenting the offering shall also present to the  Lord  a grain offering, a tenth of a measure   of bran flour mixed with a fourth of a hin of oil,     as well as wine for a libation, a fourth of a hin. You will do this with the burnt offering or the sacrifice, for each lamb.     Alternatively for a ram you shall make a grain offering of two tenths of a measure of bran flour mixed with a third of a hin of oil,     and for a libation, a third of a hin of wine, thereby presenting a pleasing aroma to the  Lord .     If you make an offering from the herd\xe2\x80\x94either a burnt offering, or a sacrifice, to fulfill a vow, or as a communion offering to the  Lord ,     with it a grain offering of three tenths of a measure of bran flour mixed with half a hin of oil will be presented;     and you will present for a libation, half a hin of wine\xe2\x80\x94a sweet-smelling oblation to the  Lord .     The same is to be done for each ox, ram, lamb or goat.     Whatever the number you offer, do the same for each of them.    All the native-born shall make these offerings in this way, whenever they present a sweet-smelling oblation to the  Lord .     Likewise, in any future generation, any alien residing with you or anyone else in your midst, who presents an oblation of pleasing aroma to the  Lord , must do as you do.     There is but one statute for you and for the resident alien, a perpetual statute throughout your generations. You and the resident alien will be alike before the  Lord ;     you and the alien residing with you will have the same rule and the same application of it.    The  Lord  spoke to Moses:     Speak to the Israelites and say to them: When you enter the land into which I am bringing you     and eat of the bread of the land, you shall offer the  Lord  a contribution.     A round loaf from your first batch of dough   you shall offer as a contribution. Just like a contribution from the threshing floor you shall offer it.       Throughout your generations you shall give a contribution to the  Lord  from your first batch of dough. Purification Offerings.       If through inadvertence you fail to do any of these commandments which the  Lord  has given to Moses\xe2\x80\x94       anything the  Lord  commanded you through Moses from the time the  Lord  first gave the command down through your generations\xe2\x80\x94     if it was done inadvertently without the communitys knowledge, the whole community shall sacrifice one bull from the herd as a burnt offering of pleasing aroma to the  Lord , along with its prescribed grain offering and libation, as well as one he-goat as a purification offering.      Then the priest shall make atonement for the whole Israelite community; and they will be forgiven, since it was inadvertence, and for their inadvertence they have brought their offering: an oblation to the  Lord  as well as their purification offering before the  Lord .     Not only the whole Israelite community but also the aliens residing among you shall be forgiven, since the inadvertent fault affects all the people.    If it is an individual who sins inadvertently,   this person shall bring a yearling she-goat as a purification offering.     And the priest shall make atonement before the  Lord  for the one who erred, since the sin was inadvertent, making atonement for the person to secure forgiveness.     You shall have but one rule for the person who sins inadvertently, whether a native-born Israelite or an alien residing among you.    But anyone who acts defiantly,   whether a native or an alien, reviles the  Lord , and shall be cut off from among the people.      For having despised the word of the  Lord  and broken his commandment, he must be cut off entirely and bear the punishment.   The Sabbath-breaker.    While the Israelites were in the wilderness, a man was discovered gathering wood on the sabbath day.     Those who caught him at it brought him to Moses and Aaron and the whole community.     But they put him in custody, for there was no clear decision   as to what should be done with him.       Then the  Lord  said to Moses: This man shall be put to death; let the whole community stone him outside the camp.     So the whole community led him outside the camp and stoned him to death, as the  Lord  had commanded Moses.   Tassels on the Cloak.    The  Lord  said to Moses:     Speak to the Israelites and tell them that throughout their generations they are to make tassels   for the corners of their garments, fastening a violet cord to each corner.       When you use these tassels, the sight of the cord will remind you of all the commandments of the  Lord  and you will do them, without prostituting yourself going after the desires of your hearts and your eyes.     Thus you will remember to do all my commandments and you will be holy to your God.     I, the  Lord , am your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt to be your God: I, the  Lord  your God.             '
