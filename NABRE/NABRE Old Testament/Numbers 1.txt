b'   The Census.    In the second year after the Israelites departure from the land of Egypt, on the first day of the second month, the  Lord  said to Moses at the tent of meeting in the wilderness of Sinai:      Take a census of the whole community of the Israelites,   by clans and ancestral houses, registering by name each male individually.     You and Aaron shall enroll in companies all the men in Israel of twenty years or more who are fit for military service.   Moses Assistants.    With you there shall be a man from each tribe, each the head of his ancestral house.     These are the names of those who are to assist you: from Reuben: Elizur, son of Shedeur;    from Simeon: Shelumiel, son of Zurishaddai;    from Judah:   Nahshon, son of Amminadab;    from Issachar: Nethanel, son of Zuar;    from Zebulun: Eliab, son of Helon;    for the descendants of Joseph: from Ephraim: Elishama, son of Ammihud; and from Manasseh: Gamaliel, son of Pedahzur;    from Benjamin: Abidan, son of Gideoni;    from Dan: Ahiezer, son of Ammishaddai;    from Asher: Pagiel, son of Ochran;    from Gad: Eliasaph, son of Reuel;    from Naphtali: Ahira, son of Enan.     These were the elect of the community, leaders of their ancestral tribes, heads of the clans of Israel.     So Moses and Aaron took these men who had been designated by name,     and assembled the whole community on the first day of the second month. Every man of twenty years or more then registered individually his name and lineage according to clan and ancestral house,     as the  Lord  had commanded Moses.

Levites Omitted in the Census.    Now the Levites were not enrolled   by their ancestral tribe with the others.       For the  Lord  had told Moses,     The tribe of Levi alone you shall not enroll nor include in the census along with the other Israelites.     You are to give the Levites charge of the tabernacle of the covenant with all its equipment and all that belongs to it. It is they who shall carry the tabernacle with all its equipment and who shall be its ministers;   and they shall camp all around the tabernacle.     When the tabernacle is to move on, the Levites shall take it down; when the tabernacle is to be pitched, it is the Levites who shall set it up. Any unauthorized person who comes near   it shall be put to death.       The other Israelites shall camp according to their companies, each in their own divisional camps,       but the Levites shall camp around the tabernacle of the covenant to ensure that Gods wrath will not fall upon the Israelite community. The Levites shall keep guard over the tabernacle of the covenant.       The Israelites complied; they did just as the  Lord  had commanded Moses.            '
