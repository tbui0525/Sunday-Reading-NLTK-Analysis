b' VI. Tobiahs Return Journey to Nineveh and the Healing of Tobit  Anxiety of the Parents.    Meanwhile, day by day, Tobit was keeping track of the time Tobiah would need to go and to return. When the number of days was reached and his son did not appear,     he said, Could it be that he has been detained there? Or perhaps Gabael has died, and there is no one to give him the money?     And he began to grieve.     His wife Anna said, My son has perished and is no longer among the living! And she began to weep aloud and to wail over her son:     Alas, child, light of my eyes, that I have let you make this journey!     But Tobit kept telling her: Be still, do not worry, my sister; he is safe! Probably they have to take care of some unexpected business there. The man who is traveling with him is trustworthy and one of our kindred. So do not grieve over him, my sister. He will be here soon.     But she retorted, You be still, and do not try to deceive me! My son has perished! She would rush out and keep watch every day at the road her son had taken. She ate nothing. After the sun had set, she would go back home to wail and cry the whole night through, getting no sleep at all.  Departure from Ecbatana.  Now when the fourteen days of the wedding celebration, which Raguel had sworn to hold for his daughter, had come to an end, Tobiah went to him and said: Send me off, now, since I know that my father and mother do not believe they will ever see me again. So I beg you, father, let me depart and go back to my own father. I have already told you how I left him.     Raguel said to Tobiah: Stay, son, stay with me. I am sending messengers to your father Tobit, and they will give him news of you.     But Tobiah insisted, No, I beg you to send me back to my father.    Raguel then promptly handed over to Tobiah his wife Sarah, together with half of all his property: male and female slaves, oxen and sheep, donkeys and camels, clothing, money, and household goods.     He saw them safely off. Embracing Tobiah, he said to him: Farewell, son. Have a safe journey. May the Lord of heaven grant prosperity to you and to your wife Sarah. And may I see children of yours before I die!     Then he said to his daughter Sarah, My daughter, honor your father-in-law and your mother-in-law, because from now on they are as much your parents as the ones who brought you into the world. Go in peace, daughter; let me hear a good report about you as long as I live. Finally he said good-bye to them and let them go. Edna also said to Tobiah: My child and beloved kinsman, may the Lord bring you back safely, and may I live long enough to see children of you and of my daughter Sarah before I die.

Together may we all prosper throughout the days of our lives. She kissed them both and saw them safely off.    Tobiah left Raguel, full of happiness and joy, and he blessed the Lord of heaven and earth, the King of all, for making his journey so successful. Finally he blessed Raguel and his wife Edna, and added, I have been commanded by the Lord to honor you all the days of your life!        '
