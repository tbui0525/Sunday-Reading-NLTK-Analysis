b'  Let Zion Rejoice  Awake, awake!  Put on your strength, Zion; Put on your glorious garments,  Jerusalem, holy city. Never again shall the uncircumcised  or the unclean enter you.  Arise, shake off the dust,  sit enthroned, Jerusalem; Loose the bonds from your neck,  captive daughter Zion!   For thus says the  Lord : For nothing you were sold,  without money you shall be redeemed.     For thus says the Lord  God : To Egypt long ago my people went down,  to sojourn there;  Assyria, too, oppressed them for nought.  But now, what am I to do here?  \xe2\x80\x94oracle of the  Lord . My people have been taken away for nothing;  their rulers mock, oracle of the  Lord ;  constantly, every day, my name is reviled.  Therefore my people shall know my name  on that day, that it is I who speaks: Here I am!  How beautiful upon the mountains   are the feet of the one bringing good news, Announcing peace, bearing good news,  announcing salvation, saying to Zion,  Your God is King!     Listen! Your sentinels raise a cry,  together they shout for joy, For they see directly, before their eyes,  the  Lord s return to Zion.   Break out together in song,  O ruins of Jerusalem! For the  Lord  has comforted his people,  has redeemed Jerusalem.  The  Lord  has bared his holy arm  in the sight of all the nations; All the ends of the earth can see  the salvation of our God.    Depart, depart, go out from there,  touch nothing unclean! Out from there!   Purify yourselves,  you who carry the vessels of the  Lord .  But not in hurried flight will you go out,  nor leave in headlong haste, For the  Lord  goes before you,  and your rear guard is the God of Israel.    Suffering and Triumph of the Servant of the Lord   See, my servant shall prosper,  he shall be raised high and greatly exalted.  Even as many were amazed at him\xe2\x80\x94  so marred were his features,  beyond that of mortals  his appearance, beyond that of human beings\xe2\x80\x94   So shall he startle many nations,  kings shall stand speechless; For those who have not been told shall see,  those who have not heard shall ponder it.
