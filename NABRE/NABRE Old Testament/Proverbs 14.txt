b'   Wisdom builds her house,  but Folly tears hers down with her own hands.   Those who walk uprightly fear the  Lord ,  but those who are devious in their ways spurn him.  In the mouth of the fool is a rod for pride,  but the lips of the wise preserve them.  Where there are no oxen, the crib is clean;  but abundant crops come through the strength of the bull.   A trustworthy witness does not lie,  but one who spouts lies makes a lying witness.    The scoffer seeks wisdom in vain,  but knowledge is easy for the intelligent.  Go from the face of the fool;  you get no knowledge from such lips.  The wisdom of the shrewd enlightens their way,  but the folly of fools is deceit.   The wicked scorn a guilt offering,  but the upright find acceptance.  The heart knows its own bitterness,  and its joy no stranger shares.   The house of the wicked will be destroyed,  but the tent of the upright will flourish.    Sometimes a way seems right,  but the end of it leads to death!   Even in laughter the heart may be sad,  and the end of joy may be sorrow.  From their own ways turncoats are sated,  from their own actions, the loyal.  The naive believe everything,  but the shrewd watch their steps.   The wise person is cautious and turns from evil;  the fool is reckless and gets embroiled.  The quick-tempered make fools of themselves,  and schemers are hated.  The simple have folly as an adornment,  but the shrewd wear knowledge as a crown.

In all labor there is profit,  but mere talk tends only to loss.  The crown of the wise is wealth;  the diadem of fools is folly.  The truthful witness saves lives,  but whoever utters lies is a betrayer.  The fear of the  Lord  is a strong defense,  a refuge even for ones children.  The fear of the  Lord  is a fountain of life,  turning one from the snares of death.  A multitude of subjects is the glory of the king;  but if his people are few, a prince is ruined.  Long-suffering results in great wisdom;  a short temper raises folly high.    A tranquil mind gives life to the body,  but jealousy rots the bones.  Those who oppress the poor revile their Maker,  but those who are kind to the needy honor him.   The wicked are overthrown by their wickedness,  but the just find a refuge in their integrity.  Wisdom can remain silent in the discerning heart,  but among fools she must make herself known.    Justice exalts a nation,  but sin is a peoples disgrace.   The king favors the skillful servant,  but the shameless one incurs his wrath.            '
