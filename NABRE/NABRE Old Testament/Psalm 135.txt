b' Praise of God, the Ruler and Benefactor of Israel  Hallelujah! I Praise the name of the  Lord !  Praise, you servants of the  Lord ,   Who stand in the house of the  Lord ,  in the courts of the house of our God!   Praise the  Lord , for the  Lord  is good!  Sing to his name, for it brings joy!   For the  Lord  has chosen Jacob for himself,  Israel as his treasured possession.    II  For I know that the  Lord  is great,  that our Lord is greater than all gods.   Whatever the  Lord  desires  he does in heaven and on earth,  in the seas and all the depths.   It is he who raises storm clouds from the end of the earth,  makes lightning for the rain,  and brings forth wind from his storehouse.    III  He struck down Egypts firstborn,   of human being and beast alike,  And sent signs and wonders against you, Egypt,  against Pharaoh and all his servants.  It is he who struck down many nations,   and slew mighty kings\xe2\x80\x94  Sihon, king of the Amorites,  and Og, king of Bashan,  all the kings of Canaan\xe2\x80\x94  And made their land a heritage,  a heritage for Israel his people.  O  Lord , your name is forever,  your renown, from generation to generation!   For the  Lord  defends his people,  shows mercy to his servants.    IV  The idols of the nations are silver and gold,   the work of human hands.  They have mouths but do not speak;  they have eyes but do not see;  They have ears but do not hear;  nor is there breath in their mouths.  Their makers will become like them,  and anyone who trusts in them.   V  House of Israel, bless the  Lord !   House of Aaron, bless the  Lord !  House of Levi, bless the  Lord !  You who fear the  Lord , bless the  Lord !  Blessed be the  Lord  from Zion,  who dwells in Jerusalem! Hallelujah!            '
