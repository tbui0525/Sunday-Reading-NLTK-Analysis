b' Divine Majesty and Human Dignity  For the leader; upon the  gittith .   A psalm of David.    O  Lord , our Lord,  how awesome is your name through all the earth!   I will sing of your majesty above the heavens   with the mouths of babes   and infants.  You have established a bulwark against your foes,  to silence enemy and avenger.    When I see your heavens, the work of your fingers,  the moon and stars that you set in place\xe2\x80\x94   What is man that you are mindful of him,   and a son of man that you care for him?   Yet you have made him little less than a god,   crowned him with glory and honor.  You have given him rule over the works of your hands,   put all things at his feet:  All sheep and oxen,  even the beasts of the field,  The birds of the air, the fish of the sea,  and whatever swims the paths of the seas.    O  Lord , our Lord,  how awesome is your name through all the earth!            '
