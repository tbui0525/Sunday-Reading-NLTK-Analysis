b'   Man born of woman  is short-lived and full of trouble,    Like a flower that springs up and fades,   swift as a shadow that does not abide.  Upon such a one will you set your eyes,  bringing me into judgment before you?  Can anyone make the unclean clean?   No one can.  Since his days are determined\xe2\x80\x94  you know the number of his months;  you have fixed the limit which he cannot pass\xe2\x80\x94  Look away from him and let him be,  while, like a hireling, he completes his day.
