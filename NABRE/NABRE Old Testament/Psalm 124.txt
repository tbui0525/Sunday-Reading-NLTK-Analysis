Had not the  Lord  been with us,  let Israel say,   Had not the  Lord  been with us,  when people rose against us,  Then they would have swallowed us alive,   for their fury blazed against us.  Then the waters would have engulfed us,  the torrent overwhelmed us;    then seething water would have drowned us.  Blessed is the  Lord , who did not leave us  to be torn by their teeth.  We escaped with our lives like a bird  from the fowlers snare;  the snare was broken,  and we escaped.   Our help is in the name of the  Lord ,  the maker of heaven and earth.             '
