b'  Death of the Heirs of Ahaziah of Judah.     When Athaliah, the mother of Ahaziah, saw that her son was dead, she began to kill off the whole royal family.     But Jehosheba,   daughter of King Joram and sister of Ahaziah, took Joash, Ahaziahs son, and spirited him away, along with his nurse, from the bedroom where the princes were about to be slain. He was concealed from Athaliah, and so he did not die.     For six years he remained hidden with her in the house of the  Lord , while Athaliah ruled as queen over the land.   Death of Athaliah.    But in the seventh year, Jehoiada summoned the captains of the Carians   and of the guards. He had them come to him in the house of the  Lord , made a covenant with them, exacted an oath from them in the house of the  Lord , and then showed them the kings son.     He gave them these orders: This is what you must do: one third of you who come on duty on the sabbath shall guard the kings house;     another third shall be at the gate Sur; and the last third shall be at the gate behind the guards. You shall guard the palace on all sides,     while the two of your divisions who are going off duty that week shall keep guard over the house of the  Lord  for the king.     You shall surround the king, each with drawn weapons, and anyone who tries to approach the guard detail is to be killed; stay with the king, wherever he goes.    The captains did just as Jehoiada the priest commanded. Each took his troops, both those going on duty for the week and those going off duty that week, and came to Jehoiada the priest.      He gave the captains King Davids spear and quivers, which were in the house of the  Lord .     And the guards, with drawn weapons, lined up from the southern to the northern limit of the enclosure, surrounding the altar and the temple on the kings behalf.     Then Jehoiada brought out the kings son and put the crown and the testimony   upon him. They proclaimed him king and anointed him, clapping their hands and shouting, Long live the king!    When Athaliah heard the noise made by the people, she came before them in the house of the  Lord .     When she saw the king standing by the column,   as was the custom, and the captains and trumpeters near the king, and all the people of the land rejoicing and blowing trumpets, Athaliah tore her garments and cried out, Treason, treason!     Then Jehoiada the priest instructed the captains in command of the force: Escort her with a guard detail. If anyone follows her, let him die by the sword. For the priest had said, She must not die in the house of the  Lord .     So they seized her, and when she reached the Horse Gate of the kings house, she was put to death.     Then Jehoiada made a covenant between the  Lord  and the king and the people,   by which they would be the  Lord s people; and another between the king and the people.     Thereupon all the people of the land went to the temple of Baal and demolished it. They shattered its altars and images completely, and slew Mattan, the priest of Baal, before the altars. Jehoiada the priest appointed a detachment for the house of the  Lord ,     and took the captains, the Carians, the guards, and all the people of the land, and they led the king down from the house of the  Lord ; they came through the guards gate to the kings house, and Joash took his seat on the royal throne.     All the people of the land rejoiced and the city was quiet, now that Athaliah had been slain with the sword at the kings house.            '
