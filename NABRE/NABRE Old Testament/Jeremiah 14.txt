b'  The Great Drought.    The word of the  Lord  that came to Jeremiah concerning the drought:     Judah mourns,  her gates are lifeless; They are bowed to the ground,  and the outcry of Jerusalem goes up.   The nobles send their servants for water,  but when they come to the cisterns They find no water  and return with empty jars.  Confounded, despairing, they cover their heads   because of the ruined soil; Because there is no rain in the land  the farmers are confounded, they cover their heads.   Even the doe in the field deserts her young  because there is no grass.  The wild donkeys stand on the bare heights,  gasping for breath like jackals; Their eyes grow dim;  there is no grass.  Even though our crimes bear witness against us,  act,  Lord , for your names sake\xe2\x80\x94 Even though our rebellions are many,  and we have sinned against you.   Hope of Israel,  Lord ,  our savior in time of need! Why should you be a stranger in the land,  like a traveler stopping only for a night?  Why are you like someone bewildered,  a champion who cannot save? You are in our midst,  Lord ,  your name we bear:  do not forsake us!    Thus says the  Lord  about this people: They so love to wander  that they cannot restrain their feet. The  Lord  takes no pleasure in them;  now he remembers their guilt,  and will punish their sins.     Then the  Lord  said to me: Do not intercede for the well-being of this people.       If they fast, I will not listen to their supplication. If they sacrifice burnt offerings or grain offerings, I will take no pleasure in them. Rather, I will destroy them with the sword, famine, and plague.     Ah! Lord  God , I replied, it is the prophets who say to them, You shall not see the sword; famine shall not befall you. Indeed, I will give you lasting peace in this place.     These prophets utter lies in my name, the  Lord  said to me: I did not send them; I gave them no command, nor did I speak to them. They prophesy to you lying visions, foolish divination, deceptions from their own imagination.       Therefore, thus says the  Lord : Concerning the prophets who prophesy in my name, though I did not send them, and who say, Sword and famine shall not befall this land: by sword and famine shall these prophets meet their end.       The people to whom they prophesy shall be thrown out into the streets of Jerusalem because of famine and the sword. No one shall bury them, their wives, their sons, or their daughters, for I will pour out upon them their own wickedness.       Speak to them this word: Let my eyes stream with tears  night and day, without rest, Over the great destruction which overwhelms  the virgin daughter of my people,  over her incurable wound.   If I walk out into the field,  look! those slain by the sword; If I enter the city,  look! victims of famine. Both prophet and priest ply their trade  in a land they do not know.  Have you really cast Judah off?  Is Zion loathsome to you? Why have you struck us a blow  that cannot be healed? We wait for peace, to no avail;  for a time of healing, but terror comes instead.   We recognize our wickedness,  Lord ,  the guilt of our ancestors:  we have sinned against you.   Do not reject us, for your names sake,  do not disgrace your glorious throne.  Remember! Do not break your covenant with us.   Among the idols of the nations are there any that give rain?  Or can the mere heavens send showers? Is it not you,  Lord ,  our God, to whom we look?  You alone do all these things.         '
