b'   But now they hold me in derision  who are younger than I,  Whose fathers I should have disdained  to rank with the dogs of my flock.  Such strength as they had meant nothing to me;  their vigor had perished.  In want and emaciating hunger   they fled to the parched lands:  to the desolate wasteland by night.  They plucked saltwort   and shrubs;  the roots of the broom plant were their food.  They were banished from the community,  with an outcry like that against a thief\xe2\x80\x94  To dwell on the slopes of the wadies,  in caves of sand and stone;  Among the bushes they brayed;  under the nettles they huddled together.  Irresponsible, of no account,  they were driven out of the land.  Yet now they sing of me in mockery;  I have become a byword among them.   They abhor me, they stand aloof,  they do not hesitate to spit in my face!   Because he has loosened my bowstring and afflicted me,  they have thrown off restraint in my presence.  On my right the young rabble rise up;  they trip my feet,  they build their approaches for my ruin.  They tear up my path,  they promote my ruin,  no helper is there against them.

You raise me up and drive me before the wind;  I am tossed about by the tempest.  Indeed I know that you will return me to death  to the house destined for everyone alive.   Yet should not a hand be held out  to help a wretched person in distress?  Did I not weep for the hardships of others;  was not my soul grieved for the poor?   Yet when I looked for good, evil came;  when I expected light, darkness came.  My inward parts seethe and will not be stilled;  days of affliction have overtaken me.  I go about in gloom, without the sun;  I rise in the assembly and cry for help.  I have become a brother to jackals,  a companion to ostriches.  My blackened skin falls away from me;  my very frame is scorched by the heat.  My lyre is tuned to mourning,  and my reed pipe to sounds of weeping.            '
