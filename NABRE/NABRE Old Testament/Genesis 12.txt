I will make of you a great nation, and I will bless you; I will make your name great, so that you will be a blessing.        I will bless those who bless you and curse those who curse you. All the families of the earth will find blessing in you.      Abram went as the  Lord  directed him, and Lot went with him. Abram was seventy-five years old when he left Haran.      Abram took his wife Sarai, his brothers son Lot, all the possessions that they had accumulated, and the persons they had acquired in Haran, and they set out for the land of Canaan. When they came to the land of Canaan,      Abram passed through the land as far as the sacred place at Shechem, by the oak of Moreh. The Canaanites were then in the land.
