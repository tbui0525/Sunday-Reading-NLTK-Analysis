Also, of the priests: descendants of Habaiah, descendants of Hakkoz, descendants of Barzillai (he had married one of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite and was named after him).     These searched their family records, but their names could not be found there, and they were excluded from the priesthood.      The governor   ordered them not to partake of the most holy foods until there should be a priest to consult the Urim and Thummim.    The entire assembly taken together came to forty-two thousand three hundred and sixty,     not counting their male and female servants, who numbered seven thousand three hundred and thirty-seven. They also had two hundred male and female singers.     Their horses numbered seven hundred and thirty-six, their mules two hundred and forty-five,     their camels four hundred and thirty-five, their donkeys six thousand seven hundred and twenty.    When they arrived at the house of the  Lord  in Jerusalem, some of the heads of ancestral houses made voluntary offerings for the house of God, to rebuild it in its place.     According to their means they contributed to the treasury for the temple service: sixty-one thousand drachmas of gold, five thousand minas of silver, and one hundred priestly robes.     The priests, the Levites, and some of the people took up residence in Jerusalem; the singers, the gatekeepers, and the temple servants settled in their cities. Thus all the Israelites settled in their cities.            '
