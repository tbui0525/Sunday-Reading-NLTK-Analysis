b' Trust in God   Of David. A  The  Lord  is my light and my salvation;  whom should  fear? The  Lord  is my lifes refuge;  of whom should  be afraid?  When evildoers come at me  to devour my flesh,   These my enemies and foes  themselves stumble and fall.  Though an army encamp against me,  my heart does not fear; Though war be waged against me,  even then do  trust.     One thing  ask of the  Lord ;  this  seek: To dwell in the  Lord s house  all the days of my life, To gaze on the  Lord s beauty,  to visit his temple.   For God will hide me in his shelter  in time of trouble,  He will conceal me in the cover of his tent;  and set me high upon a rock.  Even now my head is held high  above my enemies on every side!  will offer in his tent  sacrifices with shouts of joy;   will sing and chant praise to the  Lord .   B   Hear my voice,  Lord , when  call;  have mercy on me and answer me.  Come, says my heart, seek his face;   your face,  Lord , do  seek!   Do not hide your face from me;  do not repel your servant in anger. You are my salvation; do not cast me off;  do not forsake me, God my savior!  Even if my father and mother forsake me,  the  Lord  will take me in.      Lord , show me your way;  lead me on a level path  because of my enemies.   Do not abandon me to the desire of my foes;  malicious and lying witnesses have risen against me.   believe  shall see the  Lord s goodness  in the land of the living.    Wait for the  Lord , take courage;  be stouthearted, wait for the  Lord !            '
