b' Trust in God the Creator and Redeemer  Hallelujah!    Praise the  Lord , my soul;  I will praise the  Lord  all my life,  sing praise to my God while I live.    I  Put no trust in princes,  in children of Adam powerless to save.    Who breathing his last, returns to the earth;  that day all his planning comes to nothing.    II  Blessed the one whose help is the God of Jacob,  whose hope is in the  Lord , his God,  The maker of heaven and earth,  the seas and all that is in them,  Who keeps faith forever,   secures justice for the oppressed,   who gives bread to the hungry. The  Lord  sets prisoners free;    the  Lord  gives sight to the blind. The  Lord  raises up those who are bowed down;   the  Lord  loves the righteous.  The  Lord  protects the resident alien,  comes to the aid of the orphan and the widow,   but thwarts the way of the wicked.  The  Lord  shall reign forever,  your God, Zion, through all generations!  Hallelujah!            '
