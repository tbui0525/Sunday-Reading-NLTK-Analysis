b'   A kings heart is channeled water in the hand of the  Lord ;  God directs it where he pleases.   All your ways may be straight in your own eyes,  but it is the  Lord  who weighs hearts.   To do what is right and just   is more acceptable to the  Lord  than sacrifice.   Haughty eyes and a proud heart\xe2\x80\x94  the lamp of the wicked will fail.   The plans of the diligent end in profit,  but those of the hasty end in loss.   Trying to get rich by lying  is chasing a bubble over deadly snares.  The violence of the wicked will sweep them away,  because they refuse to do what is right.  Ones path may be winding and unfamiliar,  but ones conduct is blameless and right.
