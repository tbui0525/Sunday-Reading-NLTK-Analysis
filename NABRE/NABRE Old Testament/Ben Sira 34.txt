b'  Trust in the Lord and Not in Dreams   Empty and false are the hopes of the senseless,  and dreams give wings to fools.  Like one grasping at shadows or chasing the wind,  so anyone who believes in dreams.  What is seen in dreams is a reflection,  the likeness of a face looking at itself.  How can the unclean produce what is clean?  How can the false produce what is true?   Divination, omens, and dreams are unreal;  what you already expect, the mind fantasizes.  Unless they are specially sent by the Most High,  do not fix your heart on them.  For dreams have led many astray,  and those who put their hope in them have perished.  Without such deceptions the Law will be fulfilled,  and in the mouth of the faithful is complete wisdom.    A much-traveled person knows many things;  and one with much experience speaks sense.

Presents from the lawless do not win Gods favor.   The Most High is not pleased with the gifts of the godless,  nor for their many sacrifices does he forgive their sins.  One who slays a son in his fathers presence\xe2\x80\x94  whoever offers sacrifice from the holdings of the poor.  The bread of charity is life itself for the needy;   whoever withholds it is a murderer.  To take away a neighbors living is to commit murder;   to deny a laborer wages is to shed blood.    If one builds up and another tears down,  what do they gain but trouble?  If one prays and another curses,  whose voice will God hear?  If one again touches a corpse after bathing,  what does he gain by the purification?   So one who fasts for sins,  but goes and commits them again: Who will hear his prayer,  what is gained by mortification?            '
