b'     And I said: Hear, you leaders of Jacob,  rulers of the house of Israel! Is it not your duty to know what is right,   you who hate what is good, and love evil? You who tear their skin from them,  and their flesh from their bones;   Who eat the flesh of my people,  flay their skin from them,  and break their bones; Who chop them in pieces like flesh in a kettle,  like meat in a pot.  When they cry to the  Lord ,  he will not answer them; He will hide his face from them at that time,  because of the evil they have done.     Thus says the  Lord  regarding the prophets:  O you who lead my people astray, When your teeth have something to bite  you announce peace, But proclaim war against the one  who fails to put something in your mouth.   Therefore you shall have night, not vision,  darkness, not divination; The sun shall go down upon the prophets,  and the day shall be dark for them.   Then the seers shall be put to shame,  and the diviners confounded; They shall all cover their lips,  because there is no answer from God.  But as for me, I am filled with power,  with the spirit of the  Lord ,  with justice and with might; To declare to Jacob his crimes  and to Israel his sins.     Hear this, you leaders of the house of Jacob,  you rulers of the house of Israel! You who abhor justice,  and pervert all that is right;  Who build up Zion with bloodshed,  and Jerusalem with wickedness!  Its leaders render judgment for a bribe,  the priests teach for pay,  the prophets divine for money, While they rely on the  Lord , saying,  Is not the  Lord  in the midst of us?  No evil can come upon us!   Therefore, because of you,  Zion shall be plowed like a field,  and Jerusalem reduced to rubble, And the mount of the temple  to a forest ridge.             '
