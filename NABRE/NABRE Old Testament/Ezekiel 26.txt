b'  Against the City of Tyre.     On the first day of the eleventh month of the eleventh year, the word of the  Lord  came to me:     Son of man, because Tyre said of Jerusalem: Aha! The gateway of the peoples is smashed!  It has been turned over to me;  I will be enriched by its ruin!    therefore thus says the Lord  God : See! I am coming against you, Tyre;  I will churn up against you many nations,  just as the sea churns up its waves.  They will destroy the walls of Tyre  and tear down its towers; I will scrape off its debris  and leave it a bare rock.   It will become a place for drying nets  in the midst of the sea. For I have spoken\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the Lord  God :  she will become plunder for the nations.  Her daughter cities   on the mainland  will be slaughtered by the sword;  then they shall know that I am the  Lord .  Indeed thus says the Lord  God : I am bringing up against Tyre  from the north, Nebuchadnezzar, King of Babylon, king of kings,  with horses and chariots, with cavalry,  and a mighty horde of troops.   Your daughter cities on the mainland  he shall slay with the sword. He shall build a siege wall around you,  throw up a ramp against you,  and raise his shields about you.  He shall pound your walls with battering-rams  and break down your towers with his axes.  From the surging of his horses  he will cover you with dust;  from the noise of warhorses,  wheels and chariots. Your walls will shake  when he enters your gates,  even as one enters a city that is breached.  With the hooves of his horses  he will trample all your streets; Your people he will slay by the sword;  your mighty pillars will collapse.   They shall plunder your wealth  and pillage your goods; They will tear down your walls  and demolish your splendid houses. Your stones, timbers, and debris  they will cast into the sea.  I will bring an end to the noise of your songs;  the music of your lyres will be heard no more.  I will turn you into bare rock,  you will become a place for drying nets. You shall never be rebuilt,  for I the  Lord  have spoken\xe2\x80\x94  oracle of the Lord  God .  Thus says the Lord  God  to Tyre: At the sound of your downfall,  at the groaning of the wounded, When victims are slain within you,  will the islands not quake?  All the princes of the sea   will step down from their thrones, Lay aside their robes,  and strip off their embroidered garments. Clothed in mourning,  they will sit on the ground And tremble, horror-struck  and appalled at you.   They will raise lament   over you  and say to you: How you have perished,  gone from the seas,  Renowned City! Once she was mighty on the sea,  she and her inhabitants, Those who spread their terror  to all who dwelt nearby.   On this, the day of your fall,  the islands quake! The islands in the sea  are terrified at your passing.  Indeed thus says the Lord  God : When I make you a ruined city  like cities no longer inhabited, When I churn up the deep  and its mighty waters cover you,  Then I will thrust you down  with those who go down to the pit,   to those of the bygone age; I will make you dwell in the netherworld,  in the everlasting ruins,  with those who have gone down to the pit, So you will never return  or have a place in the land of the living.   I will make you a horror,  and you shall be no more; You shall be sought for,  but never found again\xe2\x80\x94  oracle of the Lord  God .            '
