b'  The Prayer of Judith.     Judith fell prostrate, put ashes upon her head, and uncovered the sackcloth she was wearing. Just as the evening incense was being offered in the temple of God in Jerusalem, Judith cried loudly to the Lord:       Lord, God of my father Simeon, into whose hand you put a sword to take revenge upon the foreigners   who had defiled a virgin by violating her, shaming her by uncovering her thighs, and dishonoring her by polluting her womb. You said, This shall not be done! Yet they did it.     Therefore you handed over their rulers to slaughter; and you handed over to bloodshed the bed in which they lay deceived, the same bed that had felt the shame of their own deceiving. You struck down the slaves together with their masters, and the masters upon their thrones.       Their wives you handed over to plunder, and their daughters to captivity, and all the spoils you divided among your favored children, who burned with zeal for you and in their abhorrence of the defilement of their blood called on you for help. O God, my God, hear me also, a widow.    It is you who were the author of those events and of what preceded and followed them. The present and the future you have also planned.   Whatever you devise comes into being.     The things you decide come forward and say, Here we are! All your ways are in readiness, and your judgment is made with foreknowledge.     Here are the Assyrians, a vast force, priding themselves on horse and chariot, boasting of the power of their infantry, trusting in shield and spear, bow and sling.   They do not know that you are the Lord who crushes wars;       Lord is your name. Shatter their strength in your might, and crush their force in your wrath.   For they have resolved to profane your sanctuary, to defile the tent where your glorious name resides, and to break off the horns of your altar with the sword.      See their pride, and send forth your fury upon their heads.   Give me, a widow, a strong hand to execute my plan.       By the deceit of my lips, strike down slave together with ruler, and ruler together with attendant. Crush their arrogance by the hand of a female.       Your strength is not in numbers, nor does your might depend upon the powerful.   You are God of the lowly, helper of those of little account, supporter of the weak, protector of those in despair, savior of those without hope.    Please, please, God of my father, God of the heritage of Israel, Master of heaven and earth, Creator of the waters, King of all you have created, hear my prayer!     Let my deceitful words    wound and bruise those who have planned dire things against your covenant, your holy temple, Mount Zion, and the house your children possess.       Make every nation and every tribe know clearly that you are God, the God of all power and might, and that there is no other who shields the people of Israel but you alone.            '
