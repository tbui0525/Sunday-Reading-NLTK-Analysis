b'  Joshua, Caleb, the Judges, and Samuel  Valiant warrior was  Joshua ,   son of Nun,  aide to Moses in the prophetic office, Formed to be, as his name implies,  the great savior of Gods chosen ones, To punish the enemy  and to give to Israel their heritage.   What glory was his when he raised his hand,  to brandish his sword against the city!   Who could withstand him  when he fought the battles of the  Lord ?   Was it not by that same hand the sun stopped,  so that one day became two?   He called upon the Most High God  when his enemies beset him on all sides, And God Most High answered him  with hailstones of tremendous power,  That rained down upon the hostile army  till on the slope he destroyed the foe; That all the doomed nations might know  the  Lord  was watching over his peoples battles. He was indeed a devoted follower of God   and showed himself loyal in Moses lifetime. He and  Caleb ,   son of Jephunneh,  when they opposed the rebel assembly, Averted Gods anger from the people  and suppressed the wicked complaint.   Because of this, these two alone were spared  from the six hundred thousand infantry, To lead the people into their heritage,  the land flowing with milk and honey.   The strength God gave to Caleb  remained with him even in old age Till he won his way onto the summits of the land;  his family too received a heritage,   That all the offspring of Jacob might know  how good it is to be a devoted follower of the  Lord .    The  Judges ,   each one of them,  whose hearts were not deceived, Who did not abandon God\xe2\x80\x94  may their memory be ever blessed!   May their bones flourish with new life where they lie,  and their names receive fresh luster in their children!  Beloved of his people, dear to his Maker,  pledged in a vow from his mothers womb, As one consecrated to the  Lord  in the prophetic office,  was  Samuel , the judge who offered sacrifice. At Gods word he established the kingdom  and anointed princes to rule the people.   By the law of the  Lord  he judged the congregation,  and visited the encampments of Jacob.  As a trustworthy prophet he was sought out  and his words proved him to be a true seer.  He, too, called upon the mighty Lord  when his enemies pressed him on every side,  and offered up a suckling lamb.   Then the  Lord  thundered from heaven,  and the tremendous roar of his voice was heard.   He brought low the rulers of the enemy  and destroyed all the lords of the Philistines.  When Samuel neared the end of life,  he testified before the  Lord  and his anointed prince, No bribe or secret gift have I taken from anyone!  and no one could accuse him.   Even after death his guidance was sought;  he made known to the king his fate. From the grave he spoke in prophecy  to put an end to wickedness.             '
