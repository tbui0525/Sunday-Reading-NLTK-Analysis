b'    An oracle. The word of the  Lord  to Israel through Malachi.   Israel Preferred to Edom   I love you, says the  Lord ;  but you say, How do you love us?    Was not Esau Jacobs brother?\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the  Lord .  I loved Jacob, but rejected Esau; I made his mountains a waste,  his heritage a desert for jackals.   If Edom says, We have been crushed,  but we will rebuild the ruins, Thus says the  Lord  of hosts:  They indeed may build, but I will tear down, And they shall be called territory of wickedness,  the people with whom the  Lord  is angry forever.   Your own eyes will see it, and you will say,  Great is the  Lord , even beyond the territory of Israel.   Offense in Sacrifice and Priestly Duty   A son honors his father,  and a servant fears his master; If, then, I am a father,  where is the honor due to me? And if I am a master,  where is the fear due to me? So says the  Lord  of hosts to you, O priests,  who disdain my name. But you ask, How have we disdained your name?   By offering defiled food on my altar! You ask, How have we defiled it?  By saying that the table of the  Lord  may be disdained!    When you offer a blind animal for sacrifice,  is there no wrong in that? When you offer a lame or sick animal,  is there no wrong in that? Present it to your governor!  Will he be pleased with you\xe2\x80\x94or show you favor?  says the  Lord  of hosts.  So now implore Gods favor, that he may have mercy on us!  You are the ones who have done this; Will he show favor to any of you?  says the  Lord  of hosts.   Oh, that one of you would just shut the temple gates  to keep you from kindling fire on my altar in vain! I take no pleasure in you, says the  Lord  of hosts;  and I will not accept any offering from your hands!   From the rising of the sun to its setting,  my name is great among the nations; Incense offerings are made to my name everywhere,  and a pure offering; For my name is great among the nations,  says the  Lord  of hosts.  But you profane it by saying  that the  Lord s table is defiled,  and its food may be disdained.  You say, See what a burden this is!  and you exasperate me, says the  Lord  of hosts; You bring in what is mutilated, or lame, or sick;  you bring it as an offering! Will I accept it from your hands?  says the  Lord .  Cursed is the cheat who has in his flock an intact male,  and vows it, but sacrifices to the  Lord  a defective one instead; For a great king am I, says the  Lord  of hosts,  and my name is feared among the nations.
