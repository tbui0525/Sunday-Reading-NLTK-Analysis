b' Processional Hymn  A psalm of thanksgiving. Shout joyfully to the  Lord , all you lands;   serve the  Lord  with gladness;  come before him with joyful song.   Know that the  Lord  is God,  he made us, we belong to him,  we are his people, the flock he shepherds.   Enter his gates with thanksgiving,  his courts with praise. Give thanks to him, bless his name;    good indeed is the  Lord , His mercy endures forever,  his faithfulness lasts through every generation.            '
