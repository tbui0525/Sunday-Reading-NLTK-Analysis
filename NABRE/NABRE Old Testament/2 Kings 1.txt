b'  Reign of Ahaziah, Continued.    After Ahabs death, Moab rebelled against Israel.     Ahaziah fell through the lattice of his roof terrace at Samaria and was injured. So he sent out messengers with the instructions: Go and inquire of Baalzebub,   the god of Ekron, whether I shall recover from this injury.    Meanwhile, the messenger of the  Lord  said to Elijah the Tishbite: Go and meet the messengers of Samarias king, and tell them: Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are going to inquire of Baalzebub, the god of Ekron?     For this, the  Lord  says: You shall not leave the bed upon which you lie; instead, you shall die. And Elijah departed.     The messengers then returned to Ahaziah, who asked them, Why have you returned?     They answered, A man met us and said to us, Go back to the king who sent you and tell him: The  Lord  says: Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are sending to inquire of Baalzebub, the god of Ekron? For this you shall not leave the bed upon which you lie; instead, you shall die.     The king asked them, What was the man like who met you and said these things to you?     They replied, He wore a hairy garment   with a leather belt around his waist. It is Elijah the Tishbite! he exclaimed.    Then the king sent a captain with his company of fifty men after Elijah. The prophet was seated on a hilltop when he found him. He said, Man of God, the king commands you, Come down.     Elijah answered the captain, Well, if I am a man of God, may fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty men. And fire came down from heaven and consumed him and his fifty men.       The king sent another captain with his company of fifty men after Elijah. He shouted up and said, Man of God, the king says, Come down immediately!     Elijah answered them, If I am a man of God, may fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty men. And divine fire   came down from heaven and consumed him and his fifty men.     The king sent a third captain with his company of fifty men. When the third captain had climbed the hill, he fell to his knees before Elijah, pleading with him. He said, Man of God, let my life and the lives of these fifty men, your servants, count for something in your sight!     Already fire has come down from heaven, consuming the first two captains with their companies of fifty men. But now, let my life count for something in your sight!     Then the messenger of the  Lord  said to Elijah: Go down with him; you need not be afraid of him. So Elijah left and went down with him to the king.     He declared to the king: Thus says the  Lord : Because you sent messengers to inquire of Baalzebub, the god of Ekron\xe2\x80\x94do you think there is no God in Israel to inquire of?\xe2\x80\x94you shall not leave the bed upon which you lie; instead you shall die.     Ahaziah died according to the word of the  Lord  spoken by Elijah. Since he had no son, Joram   succeeded him as king, in the second year of Joram, son of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah.    The rest of the acts of Ahaziah, which he did, are recorded in the book of chronicles of the kings of Israel.            '
