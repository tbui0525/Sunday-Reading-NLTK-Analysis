b'  Meeting with Jethro.    Now Moses father-in-law Jethro, the priest of Midian, heard of all that God had done for Moses and for his people Israel: how the  Lord  had brought Israel out of Egypt.     So his father-in-law Jethro took along Zipporah, Moses wife\xe2\x80\x94now this was after Moses had sent her back\xe2\x80\x94       and her two sons. One of these was named Gershom;   for he said, I am a resident alien in a foreign land.     The other was named Eliezer; for he said, The God of my father is my help; he has rescued me from Pharaohs sword.     Together with Moses wife and sons, then, his father-in-law Jethro came to him in the wilderness where he was encamped at the mountain of God,       and he sent word to Moses, I, your father-in-law Jethro, am coming to you, along with your wife and her two sons.    Moses went out to meet his father-in-law, bowed down, and then kissed him. Having greeted each other, they went into the tent.     Moses then told his father-in-law of all that the  Lord  had done to Pharaoh and the Egyptians for the sake of Israel, and of all the hardships that had beset them on their journey, and how the  Lord  had rescued them.     Jethro rejoiced over all the goodness that the  Lord  had shown Israel in rescuing them from the power of the Egyptians.     Blessed be the  Lord , he said, who has rescued you from the power of the Egyptians and of Pharaoh.     Now I know that the  Lord  is greater than all the gods; for he rescued the people from the power of the Egyptians when they treated them arrogantly.     Then Jethro, the father-in-law of Moses, brought a burnt offering   and sacrifices for God, and Aaron came with all the elders of Israel to share with Moses father-in-law in the meal before God.

When Moses father-in-law saw all that he was doing for the people, he asked, What is this business that you are conducting for the people? Why do you sit alone while all the people have to stand about you from morning till evening?     Moses answered his father-in-law, The people come to me to consult God.     Whenever they have a disagreement, they come to me to have me settle the matter between them and make known to them Gods statutes and instructions.    What you are doing is not wise, Moses father-in-law replied.     You will surely wear yourself out, both you and these people with you. The task is too heavy for you;   you cannot do it alone.      Now, listen to me, and I will give you some advice, and may God be with you. Act as the peoples representative before God, and bring their disputes to God.     Enlighten them in regard to the statutes and instructions, showing them how they are to conduct themselves and what they are to do.
