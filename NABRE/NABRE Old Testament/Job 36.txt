b'   Elihu continued and said:    Wait a little and I will instruct you,  for there are still words to be said for God.  I will assemble arguments from afar,  and for my maker I will establish what is right.  For indeed, my words are not a lie;  one perfect in knowledge is before you.  Look, God is great, not disdainful;  his strength of purpose is great. He does not preserve the life of the wicked.  He establishes the right of the poor;   he does not divert his eyes from the just  But he seats them upon thrones  with kings, exalted forever.   If they are bound with fetters,  held fast by bonds of affliction,  He lets them know what they have done,  and how arrogant are their sins.  He opens their ears to correction  and tells them to turn back from evil.  If they listen and serve him,  they spend their days in prosperity,  their years in happiness.

Who says, You have done wrong?   Remember, you should extol his work,  which people have praised in song.  All humankind beholds it;  everyone views it from afar.  See, God is great beyond our knowledge,  the number of his years past searching out.  He holds in check the waterdrops  that filter in rain from his flood,  Till the clouds flow with them  and they rain down on all humankind.   Can anyone understand the spreading clouds,  the thunderings from his tent?  Look, he spreads his light over it,  it covers the roots of the sea.  For by these he judges the nations,  and gives food in abundance.  In his hands he holds the lightning,  and he commands it to strike the mark.  His thunder announces him  and incites the fury of the storm.            '
