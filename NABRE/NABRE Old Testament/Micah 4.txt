b'     In days to come  the mount of the  Lord s house Shall be established as the highest mountain;  it shall be raised above the hills, And peoples shall stream to it:    Many nations shall come, and say, Come, let us climb the  Lord s mountain,  to the house of the God of Jacob, That he may instruct us in his ways,  that we may walk in his paths. For from Zion shall go forth instruction,  and the word of the  Lord  from Jerusalem.  He shall judge between many peoples  and set terms for strong and distant nations; They shall beat their swords into plowshares,  and their spears into pruning hooks; One nation shall not raise the sword against another,  nor shall they train for war again.  They shall all sit under their own vines,  under their own fig trees, undisturbed;  for the  Lord  of hosts has spoken.   Though all the peoples walk,  each in the name of its god, We will walk in the name of the  Lord ,  our God, forever and ever.     On that day\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the  Lord \xe2\x80\x94  I will gather the lame, And I will assemble the outcasts,  and those whom I have afflicted.  I will make of the lame a remnant,  and of the weak a strong nation; The  Lord  shall be king over them on Mount Zion,  from now on and forever.     And you, O tower of the flock,   hill of daughter Zion! To you it shall come:  the former dominion shall be restored,  the reign of daughter Jerusalem.    Now why do you cry out so?  Are you without a king?  Or has your adviser perished, That you are seized with pains  like a woman in labor?   Writhe, go into labor,  O daughter Zion,  like a woman giving birth; For now you shall leave the city  and camp in the fields; To Babylon you shall go,  there you shall be rescued. There the  Lord  shall redeem you  from the hand of your enemies.     And now many nations are gathered against you!  They say, Let her be profaned,  let our eyes see Zions downfall!  But they do not know the thoughts of the  Lord ,  nor understand his plan: He has gathered them  like sheaves to the threshing floor.  Arise and thresh, O daughter Zion;  your horn I will make iron And your hoofs I will make bronze,  that you may crush many peoples; You shall devote their spoils to the  Lord ,   their riches to the Lord of the whole earth.     Now grieve, O grieving daughter!   They have laid siege against us! With the rod they strike on the cheek  the ruler of Israel.            '
