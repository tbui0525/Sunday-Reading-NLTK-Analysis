b'  The Boundaries.    The  Lord  spoke to Moses:     Give the Israelites this order: When you enter the land of Canaan, this is the territory that shall fall to you as your heritage\xe2\x80\x94the land of Canaan with its boundaries:    Your southern boundary will be at the wilderness of Zin along the border of Edom;   on the east your southern boundary will begin at the end of the Salt Sea.     Then your boundary will turn south of the Akrabbim Pass and cross Zin. Terminating south of Kadesh-barnea, it extends to Hazar-addar and crosses to Azmon.       Then the boundary will turn from Azmon to the Wadi of Egypt and terminate at the Sea.     For your western boundary you will have the Great Sea   with its coast; this will be your western boundary.    This will be your boundary on the north: from the Great Sea you will draw a line to Mount Hor,       and draw it from Mount Hor to Lebo-hamath, with the boundary terminating at Zedad.     Then the boundary extends to Ziphron and terminates at Hazar-enan. This will be your northern boundary.    For your eastern boundary you will draw a line from Hazar-enan to Shepham.     From Shepham the boundary will go down to Riblah, east of Ain, and descending further, the boundary will strike the ridge on the east side of the Sea of Chinnereth;       then the boundary will descend along the Jordan and terminate with the Salt Sea. This will be your land, with the boundaries that surround it.    Moses also gave this order to the Israelites: This is the land, to be apportioned among you by lot, which the  Lord  has commanded to be given to the nine and a half tribes.     For the tribe of the Reubenites according to their ancestral houses, and the tribe of the Gadites according to their ancestral houses, as well as half of the tribe of Manasseh, have already received their heritage;     these two and a half tribes have received their heritage across the Jordan opposite Jericho, in the east, toward the sunrise.   Supervisors of the Allotment.    The  Lord  spoke to Moses:     These are the names of the men who shall apportion the land among you: Eleazar the priest, and Joshua, son of Nun;      and you will designate one leader from each of the tribes to apportion the land.     These are the names of the men: from the tribe of Judah: Caleb, son of Jephunneh,    from the tribe of the Simeonites: Samuel, son of Ammihud;    from the tribe of Benjamin: Elidad, son of Chislon;    from the tribe of the Danites: a leader, Bukki, son of Jogli;    for the descendants of Joseph: from the tribe of the Manassites: a leader, Hanniel, son of Ephod; and    from the tribe of the Ephraimites: a leader, Kemuel, son of Shiphtan;    from the tribe of the Zebulunites: a leader, Elizaphan, son of Parnach;    from the tribe of the Issacharites: a leader, Paltiel, son of Azzan;    from the tribe of the Asherites: a leader, Ahihud, son of Shelomi;    from the tribe of the Naphtalites: a leader, Pedahel, son of Ammihud.    These are the ones whom the  Lord  commanded to apportion to the Israelites their heritage in the land of Canaan.            '
