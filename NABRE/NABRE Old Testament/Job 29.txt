b' VI. Jobs Final Summary of His Cause    Job took up his theme again and said:    Oh, that I were as in the months past,  as in the days when God watched over me:   While he kept his lamp shining above my head,  and by his light I walked through darkness;  As I was in my flourishing days,  when God sheltered my tent;  When the Almighty was still with me,  and my children were round about me;  When my footsteps were bathed in cream,  and the rock flowed with streams of oil.

When I smiled on them they could not believe it;  they would not let the light of my face be dimmed.
