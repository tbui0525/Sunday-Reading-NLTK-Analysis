b'   So the inhabitants of Kiriath-jearim came for the ark of the  Lord  and brought it into the house of Abinadab on the hill, appointing his son Eleazar as guardian of the ark of the  Lord .   Samuel the Judge.    From the day the ark came to rest in Kiriath-jearim, a long time, twenty years, elapsed, and the whole house of Israel turned to the  Lord .     Then Samuel addressed the whole house of Israel: If you would return to the  Lord  with your whole heart, remove your foreign gods and your Astartes, fix your hearts on the  Lord , and serve him alone, then the  Lord  will deliver you from the hand of the Philistines.       So the Israelites removed their Baals and Astartes,   and served the  Lord  alone.     Samuel then gave orders, Gather all Israel to Mizpah, that I may pray to the  Lord  for you.       When they had gathered at Mizpah, they drew water and poured it out   on the ground before the  Lord , and they fasted that day, saying, We have sinned against the  Lord . It was at Mizpah that Samuel began to judge the Israelites.    Rout of the Philistines.    When the Philistines heard that the Israelites had gathered at Mizpah, their leaders went up against Israel. Hearing this, the Israelites became afraid of the Philistines     and appealed to Samuel, Do not stop crying out to the  Lord  our God for us, to save us from the hand of the Philistines.

There was also peace between Israel and the Amorites.     Samuel judged Israel as long as he lived.     He made a yearly circuit, passing through Bethel, Gilgal and Mizpah   and judging Israel at each of these places.     Then he used to return to Ramah, for that was his home.
