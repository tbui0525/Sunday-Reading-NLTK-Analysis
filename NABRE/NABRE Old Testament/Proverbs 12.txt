b'   Whoever loves discipline loves knowledge,  but whoever hates reproof is stupid.    A good person wins favor from the  Lord ,  but the schemer he condemns.   No one is made secure by wickedness,  but the root of the just will never be disturbed.   A woman of worth is the crown of her husband,   but a disgraceful one is like rot in his bones.   The plans of the just are right;  the designs of the wicked are deceit.   The words of the wicked are a deadly ambush,  but the speech of the upright saves them.   Overthrow the wicked and they are no more,  but the house of the just stands firm.  For their good sense people are praised,  but the perverse of heart are despised.   Better to be slighted and have a servant  than put on airs and lack bread.   The just take care of their livestock,  but the compassion of the wicked is cruel.   Those who till their own land have food in plenty,  but those who engage in idle pursuits lack sense.    A wicked person desires the catch of evil people,  but the root of the righteous will bear fruit.   By the sin of their lips the wicked are ensnared,  but the just escape from a tight spot.  From the fruit of their mouths people have their fill of good,   and the works of their hands come back upon them.   The way of fools is right in their own eyes,  but those who listen to advice are the wise.  Fools immediately show their anger,  but the shrewd conceal contempt.  Whoever speaks honestly testifies truly,  but the deceitful make lying witnesses.    The babble of some people is like sword thrusts,  but the tongue of the wise is healing.  Truthful lips endure forever,  the lying tongue, for only a moment.   Deceit is in the heart of those who plot evil,  but those who counsel peace have joy.  No harm befalls the just,  but the wicked are overwhelmed with misfortune.  Lying lips are an abomination to the  Lord ,   but those who are truthful, his delight.  The shrewd conceal knowledge,  but the hearts of fools proclaim folly.   The diligent hand will govern,  but sloth makes for forced labor.   Worry weighs down the heart,  but a kind word gives it joy.   The just act as guides to their neighbors,  but the way of the wicked leads them astray.  Sloth does not catch its prey,  but the wealth of the diligent is splendid.  In the path of justice is life,  but the way of abomination leads to death.            '
