b'    Remember your Creator in the days of your youth,  before the evil days come And the years approach of which you will say,  I have no pleasure in them;  Before the sun is darkened  and the light and the moon and the stars  and the clouds return after the rain;   When the guardians of the house tremble,  and the strong men are bent; When the women who grind are idle because they are few,  and those who look through the windows grow blind;  When the doors to the street are shut,  and the sound of the mill is low; When one rises at the call of a bird,  and all the daughters of song are quiet;  When one is afraid of heights,  and perils in the street; When the almond tree blooms,  and the locust grows sluggish  and the caper berry is without effect, Because mortals go to their lasting home,  and mourners go about the streets;   Before the silver cord is snapped  and the golden bowl is broken, And the pitcher is shattered at the spring,  and the pulley is broken at the well,  And the dust returns to the earth as it once was,  and the life breath returns to God who gave it.    Vanity of vanities, says Qoheleth,  all things are vanity!    Epilogue.     Besides being wise, Qoheleth taught the people knowledge, and weighed, scrutinized and arranged many proverbs.     Qoheleth sought to find appropriate sayings, and to write down true sayings with precision.     The sayings of the wise are like goads; like fixed spikes are the collected sayings given by one shepherd.        As to more than these,   my son, beware. Of the making of many books there is no end, and in much study there is weariness for the flesh.      The last word, when all is heard: Fear God and keep his commandments, for this concerns all humankind;      because God will bring to judgment every work, with all its hidden qualities, whether good or bad.
