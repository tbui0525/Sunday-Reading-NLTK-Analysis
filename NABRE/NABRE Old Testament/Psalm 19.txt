b' Gods Glory in the Heavens and in the Law  For the leader. A psalm of David.   I  The heavens declare the glory of God;  the firmament proclaims the works of his hands.   Day unto day pours forth speech;  night unto night whispers knowledge.   There is no speech, no words;  their voice is not heard;  A report goes forth through all the earth,  their messages, to the ends of the world. He has pitched in them a tent for the sun;    it comes forth like a bridegroom from his canopy,  and like a hero joyfully runs its course.  From one end of the heavens it comes forth;  its course runs through to the other;  nothing escapes its heat.   II  The law of the  Lord  is perfect,  refreshing the soul. The decree of the  Lord  is trustworthy,  giving wisdom to the simple.   The precepts of the  Lord  are right,  rejoicing the heart. The command of the  Lord  is clear,  enlightening the eye.  The fear of the  Lord  is pure,  enduring forever. The statutes of the  Lord  are true,  all of them just;  More desirable than gold,  than a hoard of purest gold, Sweeter also than honey  or drippings from the comb.   By them your servant is warned;   obeying them brings much reward.   III  Who can detect trespasses?  Cleanse me from my inadvertent sins.  Also from arrogant ones restrain your servant;  let them never control me. Then shall I be blameless,  innocent of grave sin.  Let the words of my mouth be acceptable,  the thoughts of my heart before you,  Lord , my rock and my redeemer.            '
