b'   Now the priest Pashhur,   son of Immer, chief officer in the house of the  Lord ,   heard Jeremiah prophesying these things.     So he struck the prophet and put him in the stocks at the upper Gate of Benjamin in the house of the  Lord .       The next morning, after Pashhur had released Jeremiah from the stocks, the prophet said to him:   Instead of Pashhur, the  Lord  names you Terror on every side.       For thus says the  Lord : Indeed, I will hand you over to terror, you and all your friends. Your own eyes shall see them fall by the sword of their enemies. All Judah I will hand over to the power of the king of Babylon,   who shall take them captive to Babylon or strike them down with the sword.     All the wealth of this city, all its resources and its valuables, all the treasures of the kings of Judah, I will hand over to their enemies, who will plunder it and carry it away to Babylon.       You, Pashhur, and all the members of your household shall go into exile. To Babylon you shall go; there you shall die and be buried, you and all your friends, because you have prophesied lies to them.    Jeremiahs Interior Crisis  You seduced me,    Lord , and I let myself be seduced;  you were too strong for me, and you prevailed. All day long I am an object of laughter;  everyone mocks me.  Whenever I speak, I must cry out,  violence and outrage I proclaim; The word of the  Lord  has brought me  reproach and derision all day long.  I say I will not mention him,  I will no longer speak in his name. But then it is as if fire is burning in my heart,  imprisoned in my bones; I grow weary holding back,  I cannot!   Yes, I hear the whisperings of many:  Terror on every side!  Denounce! let us denounce him! All those who were my friends  are on the watch for any misstep of mine. Perhaps he can be tricked; then we will prevail,  and take our revenge on him.   But the  Lord  is with me, like a mighty champion:  my persecutors will stumble, they will not prevail. In their failure they will be put to utter shame,  to lasting, unforgettable confusion.   Lord  of hosts, you test the just,  you see mind and heart, Let me see the vengeance you take on them,  for to you I have entrusted my cause.   Sing to the  Lord ,  praise the  Lord , For he has rescued the life of the poor  from the power of the evildoers!     Cursed be the day   on which I was born! May the day my mother gave me birth  never be blessed!   Cursed be the one who brought the news  to my father, A child, a son, has been born to you!  filling him with great joy.  Let that man be like the cities  which the  Lord  relentlessly overthrew; Let him hear war cries in the morning,  battle alarms at noonday,    because he did not kill me in the womb! Then my mother would have been my grave,  her womb confining me forever.   Why did I come forth from the womb,  to see sorrow and pain,  to end my days in shame?             '
