b'  A Just Shepherd.      Woe to the shepherds who destroy and scatter the flock of my pasture\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the  Lord .     Therefore, thus says the  Lord , the God of Israel, against the shepherds who shepherd my people: You have scattered my sheep and driven them away. You have not cared for them, but I will take care to punish your evil deeds.       I myself will gather the remnant of my flock from all the lands to which I have banished them and bring them back to their folds; there they shall be fruitful and multiply.       I will raise up shepherds for them who will shepherd them so that they need no longer fear or be terrified; none shall be missing\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the  Lord .     See, days are coming\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the  Lord \xe2\x80\x94  when I will raise up a righteous branch for David; As king he shall reign and govern wisely,  he shall do what is just and right in the land.   In his days Judah shall be saved,  Israel shall dwell in security. This is the name to be given him:  The  Lord  our justice.      Therefore, the days are coming\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the  Lord \xe2\x80\x94when they shall no longer say, As the  Lord  lives, who brought the Israelites out of the land of Egypt;     but rather, As the  Lord  lives, who brought the descendants of the house of Israel up from the land of the north\xe2\x80\x94and from all the lands to which I banished them; they shall again live on their own soil.   The False Prophets   Concerning the prophets: My heart is broken within me,  all my bones tremble; I am like a drunk,  like one overcome by wine, Because of the  Lord ,  because of his holy words.  The land is filled with adulterers;  because of the curse the land mourns,  the pastures of the wilderness are withered.  Theirs is an evil course,  theirs is unjust power.  Both prophet and priest are godless!  In my very house I find their wickedness\xe2\x80\x94  oracle of the  Lord .   Hence their way shall become for them  slippery ground. Into the darkness they shall be driven,  and fall headlong; For I will bring disaster upon them,  the year of their punishment\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the  Lord .   Among Samarias prophets  I saw something unseemly: They prophesied by Baal  and led my people Israel astray.   But among Jerusalems prophets  I saw something more shocking: Adultery, walking in deception,   strengthening the power of the wicked,  so that no one turns from evil; To me they are all like Sodom,  its inhabitants like Gomorrah.     Therefore, thus says the  Lord  of hosts against the prophets: Look, I will give them wormwood to eat,  and poisoned water to drink; For from Jerusalems prophets  ungodliness has gone forth into the whole land.    Thus says the  Lord  of hosts: Do not listen to the words of your prophets,  who fill you with emptiness; They speak visions from their own fancy,  not from the mouth of the  Lord .   They say to those who despise the word of the  Lord ,   Peace shall be yours; And to everyone who walks in hardness of heart,  No evil shall overtake you.   Now, who has stood in the council of the  Lord ,  to see him and to hear his word?  Who has heeded his word so as to announce it?   See, the storm of the  Lord !  His wrath breaks forth In a whirling storm  that bursts upon the heads of the wicked.   The anger of the  Lord  shall not abate  until he has carried out completely  the decisions of his heart. In days to come  you will understand fully.  I did not send these prophets,  yet they ran; I did not speak to them,  yet they prophesied.   Had they stood in my council,  they would have proclaimed my words to my people, They would have brought them back from their evil ways  and from their wicked deeds.  Am I a God near at hand only\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the  Lord \xe2\x80\x94   and not a God far off?   Can anyone hide in secret  without my seeing them?\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the  Lord . Do I not fill  heaven and earth?\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the  Lord .    I have heard the prophets who prophesy lies in my name say, I had a dream! I had a dream!     How long? Will the hearts of the prophets who prophesy lies and their own deceitful fancies ever turn back?     By the dreams they tell each other, they plan to make my people forget my name, just as their ancestors forgot my name for Baal.       Let the prophets who have dreams tell their dreams; let those who have my word speak my word truthfully! What has straw to do with wheat?   \xe2\x80\x94oracle of the  Lord .   Is not my word like fire\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the  Lord \xe2\x80\x94  like a hammer shattering rock?    Therefore I am against the prophets\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the  Lord \xe2\x80\x94those who steal my words from each other.       Yes, I am against the prophets\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the  Lord \xe2\x80\x94those who compose their own speeches and call them oracles.     Yes, I am against the prophets who tell lying dreams\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the  Lord \xe2\x80\x94those who lead my people astray by recounting their reckless lies. It was not I who sent them or commanded them; they do this people no good at all\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the  Lord .      And when this people or a prophet or a priest asks you, What is the burden of the  Lord ? you shall answer, You are the burden, and I cast you off\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the  Lord .     If a prophet or a priest or anyone else mentions the burden of the  Lord , I will punish that man and his household.     Thus you shall ask, when speaking to one another, What answer did the  Lord  give? or What did the  Lord  say?     But the burden of the  Lord  you shall mention no more. For each of you, your own word becomes the burden so that you pervert the words of the living God, the  Lord  of hosts, our God.     Thus shall you ask the prophet, What answer did the  Lord  give? or What did the  Lord  say?     But if you ask about the burden of the  Lord , then thus says the  Lord : Because you use this phrase, the burden of the  Lord , though I forbade you to use it,     therefore I will lift you on high and cast you from my presence, you and the city which I gave to you and your ancestors.     And I will bring upon you eternal reproach, eternal shame, never to be forgotten.             '
