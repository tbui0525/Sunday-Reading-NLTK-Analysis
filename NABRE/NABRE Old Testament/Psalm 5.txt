b' Prayer for Divine Help  For the leader; with wind instruments. A psalm of David.   I  Give ear to my words, O  Lord ;  understand my sighing.   Attend to the sound of my cry,  my king and my God! For to you I will pray,  Lord ;   in the morning you will hear my voice;  in the morning I will plead before you and wait.    II  You are not a god who delights in evil;  no wicked person finds refuge with you;   the arrogant cannot stand before your eyes. You hate all who do evil;   you destroy those who speak falsely.  A bloody and fraudulent man  the  Lord  abhors.   III  But I, through the abundance of your mercy,   will enter into your house. I will bow down toward your holy sanctuary  out of fear of you.   Lord , guide me in your justice because of my foes;  make straight your way before me.    IV  For there is no sincerity in their mouth;  their heart is corrupt. Their throat   is an open grave;   on their tongue are subtle lies.  Declare them guilty, God;  make them fall by their own devices.  Drive them out for their many sins;  for they have rebelled against you.   V  Then all who trust in you will be glad  and forever shout for joy.  You will protect them and those will rejoice in you  who love your name.  For you,  Lord , bless the just one;  you surround him with favor like a shield.            '
