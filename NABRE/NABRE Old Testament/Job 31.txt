b'   I made a covenant with my eyes  not to gaze upon a virgin.  What portion comes from God above,  what heritage from the Almighty on high?  Is it not calamity for the unrighteous,  and woe for evildoers?  Does he not see my ways,  and number all my steps?   If I have walked in falsehood   and my foot has hastened to deceit,  Let God weigh me in the scales of justice;  thus will he know my innocence!   If my steps have turned out of the way,  and my heart has followed my eyes,  or any stain clings to my hands,  Then may I sow, but another eat,  and may my produce be rooted up!  If my heart has been enticed toward a woman,  and I have lain in wait at my neighbors door;  Then may my wife grind for another,  and may others kneel over her!  For that would be heinous,  a crime to be condemned,   A fire that would consume down to Abaddon   till it uprooted all my crops.   Had I refused justice to my manservant  or to my maidservant, when they had a complaint against me,  What then should I do when God rises up?  What could I answer when he demands an account?  Did not he who made me in the belly make him?  Did not the same One fashion us in the womb?  If I have denied anything that the poor desired,   or allowed the eyes of the widow to languish  While I ate my portion alone,  with no share in it for the fatherless,  Though like a father he   has reared me from my youth,  guiding me even from my mothers womb\xe2\x80\x94  If I have seen a wanderer without clothing,  or a poor man without covering,  Whose limbs have not blessed me  when warmed with the fleece of my sheep;  If I have raised my hand against the innocent  because I saw that I had supporters at the gate\xe2\x80\x94   Then may my arm fall from the shoulder,  my forearm be broken at the elbow!  For I dread calamity from God,  and his majesty will overpower me.  Had I put my trust in gold  or called fine gold my security;  Or had I rejoiced that my wealth was great,  or that my hand had acquired abundance\xe2\x80\x94  Had I looked upon the light   as it shone,   or the moon in the splendor of its progress,  And had my heart been secretly enticed  to blow them a kiss with my hand,  This too would be a crime for condemnation,  for I should have denied God above.   Had I rejoiced at the destruction of my enemy  or exulted when evil came upon him,   Even though I had not allowed my mouth to sin  by invoking a curse against his life\xe2\x80\x94  Had not the men of my tent exclaimed,  Who has not been filled with his meat!   No stranger lodged in the street,  for I opened my door to wayfarers\xe2\x80\x94   Had I, all too human, hidden my sins  and buried my guilt in my bosom  Because I feared the great multitude  and the scorn of the clans terrified me\xe2\x80\x94  then I should have remained silent, and not come out of doors!   Oh, that I had one to hear my case:  here is my signature:   let the Almighty answer me! Let my accuser write out his indictment!   Surely, I should wear it on my shoulder   or put it on me like a diadem;  Of all my steps I should give him an account;  like a prince   I should present myself before him.  If my land has cried out against me  till its furrows wept together;  If I have eaten its strength without payment  and grieved the hearts of its tenants;  Then let the thorns grow instead of wheat  and stinkweed instead of barley! The words of Job are ended.            '
