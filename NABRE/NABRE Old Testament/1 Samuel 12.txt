b' Samuels Integrity.     Samuel addressed all Israel: I have granted your request in every respect, he said. I have set a king over you       and now the king will lead you. As for me, I am old and gray, and my sons are among you. I was your leader from my youth to the present day.     Here I stand! Answer me in the presence of the  Lord  and the  Lord s anointed. Whose ox have I taken? Whose donkey have I taken? Whom have I cheated? Whom have I wronged? From whom have I accepted a bribe and shut my eyes because of it? I will make restitution to you.       They replied, You have neither cheated us, nor oppressed us, nor accepted anything from anyone.     So he said to them, The  Lord  is witness against you this day, and the  Lord s anointed is witness, that you have found nothing in my possession. The  Lord  is witness, they said.   Samuel Admonishes the People.    Samuel continued: The  Lord  is witness, who appointed Moses and Aaron and brought your ancestors up from the land of Egypt.       Now take your stand, that I may judge you in the presence of the  Lord  according to all the gracious acts that the  Lord  has done for you and your ancestors.     When Jacob and his sons went to Egypt and the Egyptians oppressed them, your ancestors cried out to the  Lord . The  Lord  then sent Moses and Aaron to bring them out of Egypt and settled them in this place.       But they forgot the  Lord  their God; and so the  Lord  sold them into the power of Sisera, the captain of the army of Hazor, the power of the Philistines, and the power of the king of Moab, who made war against them.       They cried out to the  Lord  and said, We have sinned because we abandoned the  Lord  and served the Baals and Astartes. Now deliver us from the power of our enemies, and we will serve you.       The  Lord  sent Jerubbaal, Barak, Jephthah, and Samuel; he delivered you from the power of your enemies on every side, so that you could live in security.       Yet, when you saw Nahash, king of the Ammonites, advancing against you, you said to me, No! A king must rule us, even though the  Lord  your God is your king.    Warnings for People and King.    Now here is the king you chose. See! The  Lord  has given you a king.       If you fear and serve the  Lord , if you listen to the voice of the  Lord  and do not rebel against the  Lord s command, if both you and the king, who rules over you, follow the  Lord  your God\xe2\x80\x94well and good.     But if you do not listen to the voice of the  Lord  and if you rebel against the  Lord s command, the hand of the  Lord  will be against you and your king.     Now then, stand ready to witness the great marvel the  Lord  is about to accomplish before your eyes.     Are we not in the harvest time for wheat?   Yet I will call upon the  Lord , and he will send thunder and rain. Thus you will see and understand how great an evil it is in the eyes of the  Lord  that you have asked for a king.       Samuel called upon the  Lord , and the  Lord  sent thunder and rain that day. Assistance Promised.  Then all the people feared the  Lord  and Samuel.     They said to Samuel, Pray to the  Lord  your God for us, your servants, that we may not die for having added to all our other sins the evil of asking for a king.     Do not fear, Samuel answered them. You have indeed committed all this evil! Yet do not turn from the  Lord , but serve him with your whole heart.     Do not turn aside to gods who are nothing,   who cannot act and deliver. They are nothing.       For the sake of his own great name   the  Lord  will not abandon his people, since the  Lord  has decided to make you his people.       As for me, far be it from me to sin against the  Lord  by ceasing to pray for you and to teach you the good and right way.       But you must fear the  Lord  and serve him faithfully with all your heart, for you have seen the great things the  Lord  has done among you.     If instead you continue to do evil, both you and your king shall be swept away.            '
