b'  Priests.    The levitical priests, the whole tribe of Levi, shall have no hereditary portion with Israel; they shall eat the fire offerings of the  Lord  and the portions due to him.       They shall have no heritage among their kindred; the  Lord  himself is their heritage, as he has told them.       This shall be the due of the priests from the people: those who are offering a sacrifice, whether an ox or a sheep, shall give the priest the shoulder, the jowls and the stomach.     The first fruits of your grain, your wine, and your oil,   as well as the first shearing of your flock, you shall also give him.     For the  Lord , your God, has chosen him out of all your tribes to be in attendance to minister in the name of the  Lord , him and his descendants for all time.     When a Levite goes from one of your communities anywhere in Israel in which he has been residing, to visit, as his heart may desire, the place which the  Lord  will choose,     and ministers there in the name of the  Lord , his God, like all his fellow Levites who stand before the  Lord  there,     he shall receive the same portions to eat, along with his stipends and patrimony.    Prophets.    When you come into the land which the  Lord , your God, is giving you, you shall not learn to imitate the abominations of the nations there.        Let there not be found among you anyone who causes their son or daughter to pass through the fire,   or practices divination, or is a soothsayer, augur, or sorcerer,     or who casts spells, consults ghosts and spirits, or seeks oracles from the dead.     Anyone who does such things is an abomination to the  Lord , and because of such abominations the  Lord , your God, is dispossessing them before you.       You must be altogether sincere with the  Lord , your God.     Although these nations whom you are about to dispossess listen to their soothsayers and diviners, the  Lord , your God, will not permit you to do so.    A prophet like me   will the  Lord , your God, raise up for you from among your own kindred; that is the one to whom you shall listen.       This is exactly what you requested of the  Lord , your God, at Horeb on the day of the assembly, when you said, Let me not again hear the voice of the  Lord , my God, nor see this great fire any more, or I will die.       And the  Lord  said to me, What they have said is good.     I will raise up for them a prophet like you from among their kindred, and will put my words into the mouth of the prophet; the prophet shall tell them all that I command.       Anyone who will not listen to my words which the prophet speaks in my name, I myself will hold accountable for it.       But if a prophet presumes to speak a word in my name   that I have not commanded, or speaks in the name of other gods, that prophet shall die.    Should you say to yourselves, How can we recognize that a word is one the  Lord  has not spoken?,     if a prophet speaks in the name of the  Lord  but the word does not come true, it is a word the  Lord  did not speak. The prophet has spoken it presumptuously; do not fear him.            '
