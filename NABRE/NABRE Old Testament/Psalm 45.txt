b' Song for a Royal Wedding  For the leader; according to Lilies. A  maskil  of the Korahites. A love song.   I  My heart is stirred by a noble theme,  as I sing my ode to the king.  My tongue is the pen of a nimble scribe.   II  You are the most handsome of men;  fair speech has graced your lips,  for God has blessed you forever.   Gird your sword upon your hip, mighty warrior!  In splendor and majesty ride on triumphant!   In the cause of truth, meekness, and justice  may your right hand show your wondrous deeds.  Your arrows are sharp;  peoples will cower at your feet;  the kings enemies will lose heart.  Your throne, O God,   stands forever;   your royal scepter is a scepter for justice.  You love justice and hate wrongdoing;  therefore God, your God, has anointed you  with the oil of gladness above your fellow kings.  With myrrh, aloes, and cassia  your robes are fragrant. From ivory-paneled palaces   stringed instruments bring you joy.  Daughters of kings are your lovely wives;  a princess arrayed in Ophirs gold   comes to stand at your right hand.   III  Listen, my daughter, and understand;  pay me careful heed. Forget your people and your fathers house,    that the king might desire your beauty. He is your lord;    honor him, daughter of Tyre. Then the richest of the people  will seek your favor with gifts.  All glorious is the kings daughter as she enters,   her raiment threaded with gold;  In embroidered apparel she is led to the king.  The maids of her train are presented to the king.  They are led in with glad and joyous acclaim;  they enter the palace of the king.   IV  The throne of your fathers your sons will have;  you shall make them princes through all the land.   I will make your name renowned through all generations;  thus nations shall praise you forever.             '
