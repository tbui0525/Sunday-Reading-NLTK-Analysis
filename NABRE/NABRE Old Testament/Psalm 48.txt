b' The Splendor of the Invincible City  A psalm of the Korahites.   A song.   I  Great is the  Lord  and highly praised  in the city of our God:  His holy mountain,   fairest of heights,  the joy of all the earth,   Mount Zion, the heights of Zaphon,    the city of the great king.   II  God is in its citadel,  renowned as a stronghold.  See! The kings assembled,  together they advanced.   When they looked they were astounded;  terrified, they were put to flight!   Trembling seized them there,  anguish, like a womans labor,   As when the east wind wrecks  the ships of Tarshish!    III   What we had heard we have now seen  in the city of the  Lord  of hosts, In the city of our God,  which God establishes forever. Selah  We ponder, O God, your mercy  within your temple  Like your name, O God,  so is your praise to the ends of the earth.  Your right hand is fully victorious.   Mount Zion is glad! The daughters of Judah rejoice  because of your judgments!    IV  Go about Zion, walk all around it,  note the number of its towers.  Consider the ramparts, examine its citadels,  that you may tell future generations:   That this is God,  our God for ever and ever.   He will lead us until death.            '
