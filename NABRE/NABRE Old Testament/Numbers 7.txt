b'  Offerings of the Tribal Leaders.    Now, when Moses had completed the erection of the tabernacle, he anointed and consecrated it with all its equipment,   as well as the altar with all its equipment. After he anointed and consecrated them,     an offering was made by the tribal leaders of Israel, who were heads of ancestral houses, the same leaders of the tribes who supervised those enrolled.     The offering they brought before the  Lord  consisted of six wagons for baggage and twelve oxen, that is, a wagon for every two tribal leaders, and an ox for each. These they presented before the tabernacle.    The  Lord  then said to Moses:     Accept their offering, that these things may be put to use to maintain the tent of meeting. Assign them to the Levites, to each according to his duties.     So Moses accepted the wagons and oxen, and assigned them to the Levites.     He gave two wagons and four oxen to the Gershonites   according to their duties,     and four wagons and eight oxen to the Merarites according to their duties, under the supervision of Ithamar, son of Aaron the priest.     He gave none to the Kohathites, because they were responsible for maintenance of the sacred objects that had to be carried on their shoulders.     For the dedication of the altar also, the tribal leaders brought offerings when it was anointed;   the leaders presented their offering before the altar.
