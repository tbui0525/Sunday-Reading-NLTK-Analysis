b'  The Judgment and Deliverance of Israel   On that day, The  Lord  will punish with his sword  that is cruel, great, and strong, Leviathan the fleeing serpent,  Leviathan the coiled serpent;  he will slay the dragon   in the sea.       On that day\xe2\x80\x94 The pleasant vineyard, sing about it!    I, the  Lord , am its keeper,  I water it every moment; Lest anyone harm it,  night and day I guard it.   I am not angry.  But if I were to find briers and thorns, In battle I would march against it;  I would burn it all.   But if it holds fast to my refuge,  it shall have peace with me;   it shall have peace with me.    In days to come Jacob shall take root,  Israel shall sprout and blossom,  covering all the world with fruit.    Was he smitten as his smiter was smitten?  Was he slain as his slayer was slain?  Driving out and expelling, he struggled against it,  carrying it off with his cruel wind on a day of storm.   This, then, shall be the expiation of Jacobs guilt,  this the result of removing his sin: He shall pulverize all the stones of the altars  like pieces of chalk;  no asherahs or incense altars shall stand.  For the fortified city shall be desolate,  an abandoned pasture, a forsaken wilderness; There calves shall graze, there they shall lie down,  and consume its branches.  When its boughs wither, they shall be broken off;  and women shall come to kindle fires with them. For this is not an understanding people;  therefore their maker shall not spare them;  their creator shall not be gracious to them.    On that day, The  Lord  shall beat out grain  from the channel of the Euphrates to the Wadi of Egypt,  and you shall be gleaned   one by one, children of Israel.   On that day,  A great trumpet shall blow,  and the lost in the land of Assyria  and the outcasts in the land of Egypt Shall come and worship the  Lord  on the holy mountain, in Jerusalem.
