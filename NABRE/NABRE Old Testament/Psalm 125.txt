b' Israels Protector  A song of ascents. Those trusting in the  Lord  are like Mount Zion,  unshakable, forever enduring.   As mountains surround Jerusalem,  the  Lord  surrounds his people  both now and forever.

Do good,  Lord , to the good,  to those who are upright of heart.   But those who turn aside to crooked ways  may the  Lord  send down with the evildoers.  Peace upon Israel!             '
