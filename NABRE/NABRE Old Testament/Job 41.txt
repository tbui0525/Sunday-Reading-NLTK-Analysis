b'   Whoever might vainly hope to do so  need only see him to be overthrown.  No one is fierce enough to arouse him;  who then dares stand before me?  Whoever has assailed me, I will pay back\xe2\x80\x94  Everything under the heavens is mine.  I need hardly mention his limbs,  his strength, and the fitness of his equipment.  Who can strip off his outer garment,  or penetrate his double armor?  Who can force open the doors of his face,  close to his terrible teeth?  Rows of scales are on his back,  tightly sealed together;  They are fitted so close to each other  that no air can come between them;  So joined to one another  that they hold fast and cannot be parted.  When he sneezes, light flashes forth;  his eyes are like the eyelids of the dawn.  Out of his mouth go forth torches;  sparks of fire leap forth.  From his nostrils comes smoke  as from a seething pot or bowl.  His breath sets coals afire;  a flame comes from his mouth.  Strength abides in his neck,  and power leaps before him.  The folds of his flesh stick together,  it is cast over him and immovable.  His heart is cast as hard as stone;  cast as the lower millstone.  When he rises up, the gods are afraid;  when he crashes down, they fall back.  Should a sword reach him, it will not avail;  nor will spear, dart, or javelin.  He regards iron as chaff,  and bronze as rotten wood.  No arrow will put him to flight;  slingstones used against him are but straw.  Clubs he regards as straw;  he laughs at the crash of the spear.  Under him are sharp pottery fragments,  spreading a threshing sledge upon the mire.  He makes the depths boil like a pot;  he makes the sea like a perfume bottle.  Behind him he leaves a shining path;  you would think the deep had white hair.  Upon the earth there is none like him,  he was made fearless.  He looks over all who are haughty,  he is king over all proud beasts.  '
