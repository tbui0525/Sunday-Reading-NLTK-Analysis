b'  Confidence in God Leads to Prosperity   My son, do not forget   my teaching,  take to heart my commands;  For many days, and years of life,   and peace, will they bring you.  Do not let love and fidelity forsake you;  bind them around your neck;  write them on the tablet of your heart.  Then will you win favor and esteem  before God and human beings.  Trust in the  Lord  with all your heart,  on your own intelligence do not rely;  In all your ways be mindful of him,  and he will make straight your paths.  Do not be wise in your own eyes,   fear the  Lord  and turn away from evil;  This will mean health for your flesh  and vigor for your bones.  Honor the  Lord  with your wealth,  with first fruits of all your produce;   Then will your barns be filled with plenty,  with new wine your vats will overflow.  The discipline of the  Lord , my son, do not spurn;   do not disdain his reproof;   For whom the  Lord  loves he reproves,  as a father, the son he favors.    The Benefits of Finding Wisdom   Happy the one who finds wisdom,  the one who gains understanding!   Her profit is better than profit in silver,  and better than gold is her revenue;  She is more precious than corals,  and no treasure of yours can compare with her.   Long life is in her right hand,  in her left are riches and honor;  Her ways are pleasant ways,  and all her paths are peace;  She is a tree of life   to those who grasp her,  and those who hold her fast are happy.   The  Lord  by wisdom founded the earth,  established the heavens by understanding;  By his knowledge the depths   are split,  and the clouds drop down dew.   Justice Toward Ones Neighbor Brings Blessing   My son, do not let these slip from your sight:  hold to deliberation and planning;  So will they be life to your soul,   and an adornment for your neck.  Then you may go your way securely;  your foot will never stumble;  When you lie down, you will not be afraid,  when you rest, your sleep will be sweet.  Do not be afraid of sudden terror,  of the ruin of the wicked when it comes;  For the  Lord  will be your confidence,  and will keep your foot from the snare.  Do not withhold any goods from the owner  when it is in your power to act.  Say not to your neighbor, Go, come back tomorrow,  and I will give it to you, when all the while you have it.  Do not plot evil against your neighbors,  when they live at peace with you.  Do not contend with someone without cause,  with one who has done you no harm.  Do not envy the violent  and choose none of their ways:   To the  Lord  the devious are an abomination,  but the upright are close to him.  The curse of the  Lord  is on the house of the wicked,  but the dwelling of the just he blesses;  Those who scoff, he scoffs at,   but the lowly he favors.  The wise will possess glory,  but fools will bear shame.            '
