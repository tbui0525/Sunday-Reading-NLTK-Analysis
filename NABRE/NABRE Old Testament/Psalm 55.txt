b' A Lament over Betrayal  For the leader. On stringed instruments. A  maskil  of David.   I  Listen, God, to my prayer;   do not hide from my pleading;   hear me and give answer. I rock with grief; I groan   at the uproar of the enemy,  the clamor of the wicked. They heap trouble upon me,  savagely accuse me.  My heart pounds within me;  deaths terrors fall upon me.  Fear and trembling overwhelm me;  shuddering sweeps over me.  I say, If only I had wings like a dove  that I might fly away and find rest.   Far away I would flee;  I would stay in the desert.  Selah  I would soon find a shelter  from the raging wind and storm.   II  Lord, check and confuse their tongues.  For I see violence and strife in the city   making rounds on its walls day and night. Within are mischief and trouble;   treachery is in its midst;  oppression and fraud never leave its streets.   For it is not an enemy that reviled me\xe2\x80\x94  that I could bear\xe2\x80\x94 Not a foe who viewed me with contempt,  from that I could hide.  But it was you, my other self,  my comrade and friend,   You, whose company I enjoyed,  at whose side I walked  in the house of God.   III  Let death take them;  let them go down alive to Sheol,   for evil is in their homes and bellies.  But I will call upon God,  and the  Lord  will save me.  At dusk, dawn, and noon  I will grieve and complain,  and my prayer will be heard.   He will redeem my soul in peace  from those who war against me,  though there are many who oppose me.  God, who sits enthroned forever,   will hear me and afflict them. Selah For they will not mend their ways;  they have no fear of God.  He stretched out his hand at his friends  and broke his covenant.  Softer than butter is his speech,  but war is in his heart. Smoother than oil are his words,  but they are unsheathed swords.   Cast your care upon the  Lord ,  who will give you support. He will never allow  the righteous to stumble.   But you, God, will bring them down  to the pit of destruction.  These bloodthirsty liars  will not live half their days,  but I put my trust in you.             '
