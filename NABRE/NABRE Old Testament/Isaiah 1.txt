b'   Chapter 1   The vision which Isaiah, son of Amoz, saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.   Accusation and Appeal   Hear, O heavens, and listen, O earth,  for the  Lord  speaks: Sons have I raised and reared,  but they have rebelled against me!   An ox knows its owner,  and an ass,   its masters manger; But Israel does not know,  my people has not understood.   Ah!   Sinful nation, people laden with wickedness,  evil offspring, corrupt children! They have forsaken the  Lord ,  spurned the Holy One of Israel,  apostatized,   Why   would you yet be struck,  that you continue to rebel? The whole head is sick,  the whole heart faint.  From the sole of the foot to the head  there is no sound spot in it; Just bruise and welt and oozing wound,  not drained, or bandaged,  or eased with salve.  Your country is waste,  your cities burnt with fire; Your land\xe2\x80\x94before your eyes  strangers devour it,  a waste, like the devastation of Sodom.    And daughter Zion   is left  like a hut in a vineyard, Like a shed in a melon patch,  like a city blockaded.  If the  Lord  of hosts   had not  left us a small remnant, We would have become as Sodom,  would have resembled Gomorrah.      Hear the word of the  Lord ,  princes of Sodom! Listen to the instruction of our God,  people of Gomorrah!  What do I care for the multitude of your sacrifices?  says the  Lord . I have had enough of whole-burnt rams  and fat of fatlings; In the blood of calves, lambs, and goats  I find no pleasure.   When you come to appear before me,  who asks these things of you?  Trample my courts no more!  To bring offerings is useless;  incense is an abomination to me. New moon and sabbath, calling assemblies\xe2\x80\x94  festive convocations with wickedness\xe2\x80\x94  these I cannot bear.   Your new moons and festivals I detest;   they weigh me down, I tire of the load.  When you spread out your hands,  I will close my eyes to you; Though you pray the more,  I will not listen. Your hands are full of blood!     Wash yourselves clean! Put away your misdeeds from before my eyes;  cease doing evil;   learn to do good. Make justice your aim: redress the wronged,  hear the orphans plea, defend the widow.     Come now, let us set things right,   says the  Lord : Though your sins be like scarlet,  they may become white as snow; Though they be red like crimson,  they may become white as wool.   If you are willing, and obey,  you shall eat the good things of the land;  But if you refuse and resist,  you shall be eaten by the sword:  for the mouth of the  Lord  has spoken!   The Purification of Jerusalem  How she has become a prostitute,  the faithful city,   so upright! Justice used to lodge within her,  but now, murderers.   Your silver is turned to dross,  your wine is mixed with water.  Your princes are rebels  and comrades of thieves; Each one of them loves a bribe  and looks for gifts. The fatherless they do not defend,  the widows plea does not reach them.   Now, therefore, says the Lord,  the  Lord  of hosts, the Mighty One of Israel: Ah! I will take vengeance on my foes  and fully repay my enemies!   I will turn my hand against you,  and refine your dross in the furnace,  removing all your alloy.  I will restore your judges   as at first,  and your counselors as in the beginning; After that you shall be called  city of justice, faithful city.    Zion shall be redeemed by justice,  and her repentant ones by righteousness.  Rebels and sinners together shall be crushed,  those who desert the  Lord  shall be consumed.   Judgment on the Sacred Groves   You shall be ashamed of the terebinths which you desired,  and blush on account of the gardens which you chose.  You shall become like a terebinth whose leaves wither,  like a garden that has no water.  The strong tree shall turn to tinder,  and the one who tends it shall become a spark; Both of them shall burn together,  and there shall be none to quench them.            '
