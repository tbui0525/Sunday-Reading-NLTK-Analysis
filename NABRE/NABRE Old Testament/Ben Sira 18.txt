b'  The Divine Power and Mercy   He who lives forever created the whole universe;   the  Lord  alone is just.   To whom has he given power to describe his works,  and who can search out his mighty deeds?  Who can measure his majestic power,  or fully recount his mercies?  No one can lessen, increase,  or fathom the wonders of the Lord.  When mortals finish, they are only beginning,  and when they stop they are still bewildered.  What are mortals? What are they worth?  What is good in them, and what is evil?  The number of their days seems great  if it reaches a hundred years.   Like a drop of water from the sea and a grain of sand,  so are these few years among the days of eternity.  That is why the Lord is patient with them  and pours out his mercy on them.  He sees and understands that their death is wretched,  and so he forgives them all the more.  Their compassion is for their neighbor,  but the Lords compassion reaches all flesh, Reproving, admonishing, teaching,  and turning them back, as a shepherd his flock.   He has compassion on those who accept his discipline,  who are eager for his precepts.   The Need for Prudence  My child, add no reproach to your charity,   or spoil any gift by harsh words.  Does not the dew give relief from the scorching heat?  So a word can be better than a gift.  Indeed does not a word count more than a good gift?  But both are offered by a kind person.  The fool is ungracious and abusive,  and a grudging gift makes the eyes smart.     Before you speak, learn;  before you get sick, prepare the cure.  Before you are judged, examine yourself,  and at the time of scrutiny you will have forgiveness.  Before you fall ill, humble yourself;  and when you have sinned, show repentance.  Do not delay forsaking your sins;  do not neglect to do so until you are in distress.    Let nothing prevent the prompt payment of your vows;  do not wait until death to fulfill them.   Before making a vow prepare yourself;  do not be like one who puts the Lord to the test.  Think of wrath on the day of death,  the time of vengeance when he will hide his face.   Think of the time of hunger in the time of plenty,  poverty and need in the day of wealth.   Between morning and evening there is a change of time;  before the Lord all things are fleeting.    The wise are discreet in all things;  where sin is rife they keep themselves from wrongdoing.  Every wise person teaches wisdom,   and those who know her declare her praise;  Those skilled in words become wise themselves,  and pour forth apt proverbs.   Self-Control   Do not let your passions be your guide,   but keep your desires in check.  If you allow yourself to satisfy your passions,  they will make you the laughingstock of your enemies.  Take no pleasure in too much luxury  which brings on poverty redoubled.  Do not become a glutton and a drunkard  with nothing in your purse.            '
