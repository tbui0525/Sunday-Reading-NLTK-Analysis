b'  Corruption of Cult, Domestic and Foreign Politics  Put the trumpet to your lips!   One like an eagle   is over the house of the  Lord ! Because they have violated my covenant,  and rebelled against my law,  They cry out to me,  My God! We know you!  But Israel has rejected what is good;  the enemy   shall pursue him.
