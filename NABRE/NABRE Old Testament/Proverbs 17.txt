b'   Better a dry crust with quiet  than a house full of feasting with strife.   A wise servant will rule over an unworthy son,  and will share the inheritance of the children.   The crucible for silver, and the furnace for gold,  but the tester of hearts is the  Lord .  The evildoer gives heed to wicked lips,  the liar, to a mischievous tongue.  Whoever mocks the poor reviles their Maker;  whoever rejoices in their misfortune will not go unpunished.   Childrens children are the crown of the elderly,  and the glory of children is their parentage.  Fine words ill fit a fool;  how much more lying lips, a noble!  A bribe seems a charm to its user;  at every turn it brings success.   Whoever overlooks an offense fosters friendship,  but whoever gossips about it separates friends.   A single reprimand does more for a discerning person  than a hundred lashes for a fool.   The wicked pursue only rebellion,  and a merciless messenger is sent against them.   Face a bear robbed of her cubs,  but never fools in their folly!   If you return evil for good,  evil will not depart from your house.    The start of strife is like the opening of a dam;  check a quarrel before it bursts forth!

A friend is a friend at all times,  and a brother is born for the time of adversity.   Those without sense give their hands in pledge,  becoming surety for their neighbors.   Those who love an offense love a fight;   those who build their gate high   court disaster.  The perverse in heart come to no good,  and the double-tongued fall into trouble.   Whoever conceives a fool has grief;  the father of a numskull has no joy.  A joyful heart is the health of the body,  but a depressed spirit dries up the bones.   A guilty person takes out a bribe from the pocket,  thus perverting the course of justice.   On the countenance of a discerning person is wisdom,   but the eyes of a fool are on the ends of the earth.   A foolish son is vexation to his father,  and bitter sorrow to her who bore him.   It is wrong to fine an innocent person,  but beyond reason to scourge nobles.  Those who spare their words are truly knowledgeable,  and those who are discreet are intelligent.   Even fools, keeping silent, are considered wise;  if they keep their lips closed, intelligent.             '
