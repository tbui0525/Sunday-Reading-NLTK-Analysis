b'  The Song of the Vineyard   Now let me sing of my friend,  my beloveds song about his vineyard. My friend had a vineyard  on a fertile hillside;  He spaded it, cleared it of stones,  and planted the choicest vines; Within it he built a watchtower,  and hewed out a wine press. Then he waited for the crop of grapes,  but it yielded rotten grapes.   Now, inhabitants of Jerusalem, people of Judah,  judge between me and my vineyard:  What more could be done for my vineyard  that I did not do?  Why, when I waited for the crop of grapes,  did it yield rotten grapes?  Now, I will let you know  what I am going to do to my vineyard: Take away its hedge, give it to grazing,  break through its wall, let it be trampled!   Yes, I will make it a ruin:  it shall not be pruned or hoed,  but will be overgrown with thorns and briers; I will command the clouds  not to rain upon it.  The vineyard of the  Lord  of hosts is the house of Israel,  the people of Judah, his cherished plant; He waited for judgment, but see, bloodshed!  for justice, but hark, the outcry!    Oracles of Reproach    Ah! Those who join house to house,  who connect field with field, Until no space remains, and you alone dwell  in the midst of the land!   In my hearing the  Lord  of hosts has sworn:   Many houses shall be in ruins,  houses large and fine, with nobody living there.   Ten acres of vineyard  shall yield but one bath,  And a homer of seed  shall yield but an ephah.   Ah! Those who rise early in the morning  in pursuit of strong drink, lingering late  inflamed by wine,  Banqueting on wine with harp and lyre,  timbrel and flute,  But the deed of the  Lord  they do not regard,  the work of his hands they do not see!   Therefore my people go into exile  for lack of understanding,  Its nobles starving,  its masses parched with thirst.  Therefore Sheol enlarges its throat  and opens its mouth beyond measure;  Down into it go nobility and masses,  tumult and revelry.  All shall be abased, each one brought low,  and the eyes of the haughty lowered,   But the  Lord  of hosts shall be exalted by judgment,  by justice the Holy God shown holy.   Lambs shall graze as at pasture,  young goats shall eat in the ruins of the rich.  Ah! Those who tug at guilt with cords of perversity,  and at sin as if with cart ropes!   Who say, Let him make haste,  let him speed his work, that we may see it; On with the plan of the Holy One of Israel!  let it come to pass, that we may know it!   Ah! Those who call evil good, and good evil,  who change darkness to light, and light into darkness,  who change bitter to sweet, and sweet into bitter!   Ah! Those who are wise in their own eyes,  prudent in their own view!   Ah! Those who are champions at drinking wine,  masters at mixing drink!  Those who acquit the guilty for bribes,  and deprive the innocent of justice!   Therefore, as the tongue of fire licks up stubble,  as dry grass shrivels in the flame, Their root shall rot  and their blossom scatter like dust; For they have rejected the instruction of the  Lord  of hosts,  and scorned the word of the Holy One of Israel.     Therefore the wrath of the  Lord  blazes against his people,  he stretches out his hand to strike them; The mountains quake,   their corpses shall be like refuse in the streets. For all this, his wrath is not turned back,  his hand is still outstretched.   Invasion   He will raise a signal to a far-off nation,  and whistle for it from the ends of the earth.   Then speedily and promptly they will come.  None among them is weary, none stumbles,  none will slumber, none will sleep. None with waist belt loose,  none with sandal thong broken.  Their arrows are sharp,  and all their bows are bent, The hooves of their horses like flint,  and their chariot wheels like the whirlwind.  They roar like the lion,  like young lions, they roar; They growl and seize the prey,  they carry it off and none can rescue.  They will growl over it, on that day,  like the growling of the sea, Look to the land\xe2\x80\x94  darkness closing in,  the light dark with clouds!             '
