b' The Lord My Guardian  A song of ascents. I raise my eyes toward the mountains.   From whence shall come my help?   My help comes from the  Lord ,  the maker of heaven and earth.     He will not allow your foot to slip;   or your guardian to sleep.  Behold, the guardian of Israel  never slumbers nor sleeps.   The  Lord  is your guardian;  the  Lord  is your shade  at your right hand.   By day the sun will not strike you,  nor the moon by night.   The  Lord  will guard you from all evil;  he will guard your soul.   The  Lord  will guard your coming and going  both now and forever.             '
