b'  Nathan, David, and Solomon  After him came  Nathan   who served in Davids presence.   Like the choice fat of sacred offerings,  so was  David  in Israel.   He played with lions as though they were young goats,  and with bears, like lambs of the flock.   As a youth he struck down the giant  and wiped out the peoples disgrace; His hand let fly the slingstone  that shattered the pride of Goliath.   For he had called upon the Most High God,  who gave strength to his right arm To defeat the skilled warrior  and establish the might of his people.  Therefore the women sang his praises  and honored him for the tens of thousands. When he received the royal crown, he battled    and subdued the enemy on every side. He campaigned against the hostile Philistines  and shattered their power till our own day.   With his every deed he offered thanks  to God Most High, in words of praise. With his whole heart he loved his Maker   and daily had his praises sung;  He added beauty to the feasts  and solemnized the seasons of each year  With string music before the altar,  providing sweet melody for the psalms   So that when the Holy Name was praised,  before daybreak the sanctuary would resound.  The  Lord  forgave him his sins  and exalted his strength forever; He conferred on him the rights of royalty  and established his throne in Israel.     Because of his merits he had as successor   a wise son, who lived in security:   Solomon  reigned during an era of peace,  for God brought rest to all his borders.

With song and proverb and riddle,  and with your answers, you astounded the nations.  You were called by that glorious name  which was conferred upon Israel.  Gold you gathered like so much iron;  you heaped up silver as though it were lead.  But you abandoned yourself to women  and gave them dominion over your body.   You brought a stain upon your glory,  shame upon your marriage bed, Wrath upon your descendants,  and groaning upon your deathbed.  Thus two governments came into being,  when in Ephraim kingship was usurped.   But God does not withdraw his mercy,  nor permit even one of his promises to fail. He does not uproot the posterity of the chosen,  nor destroy the offspring of his friends. So he gave to Jacob a remnant,  to David a root from his own family.    Rehoboam and Jeroboam  Solomon finally slept with his ancestors,  and left behind him one of his sons, Broad   in folly, narrow in sense,  whose policy made the people rebel. Then arose the one who should not be remembered,  the sinner who led Israel into sin,  Who brought ruin to Ephraim   and caused them to be exiled from their land.   Elijah and Elisha  Their sinfulness grew more and more,  and they gave themselves to every evil             '
