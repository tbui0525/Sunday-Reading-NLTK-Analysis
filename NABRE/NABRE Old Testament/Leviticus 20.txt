b'  Penalties for Various Sins.     The  Lord  said to Moses:     Tell the Israelites: Anyone, whether an Israelite or an alien residing in Israel, who gives offspring to Molech shall be put to death.   The people of the land shall stone that person.      I myself will turn against and cut off   that individual from among the people; for in the giving of offspring to Molech, my sanctuary was defiled   and my holy name was profaned.     If the people of the land condone the giving of offspring to Molech, by failing to put the wrongdoer to death,     I myself will turn against that individual and his or her family, and I will cut off from their people both the wrongdoer and all who follow this person by prostituting themselves with Molech.    Should anyone turn to ghosts and spirits and prostitute oneself with them,   I will turn against that person and cut such a one off from among the people.     Sanctify yourselves, then, and be holy; for I, the  Lord , your God,   am holy.     Be careful, therefore, to observe my statutes. I, the  Lord , make you holy.    Anyone who curses father or mother shall be put to death;    and having cursed father or mother, such a one will bear the bloodguilt.        If a man commits adultery with his neighbors wife,   both the adulterer and the adulteress shall be put to death.     If a man disgraces his father by lying with his fathers wife,   the two of them shall be put to death; their bloodguilt is upon them.     If a man lies with his daughter-in-law,   both of them shall be put to death; they have done what is perverse; their bloodguilt is upon them.     If a man lies with a male as with a woman,   they have committed an abomination; the two of them shall be put to death; their bloodguilt is upon them.     If a man marries a woman and her mother also,   that is shameful conduct; the man and the two women as well shall be burned to death, so that shamefulness may not be found among you.     If a man has sexual relations with an animal,   the man shall be put to death, and you shall kill the animal.     If a woman goes up to any animal to mate with it,   you shall kill the woman and the animal; they shall both be put to death; their bloodguilt is upon them.     If a man marries his sister,   his fathers daughter or his mothers daughter, and they have intercourse with each other, that is disgraceful; they shall be publicly cut off   from the people; the man shall bear the penalty of having had intercourse with his own sister.     If a man lies with a woman during her menstrual period and has intercourse with her, he has laid bare the source of her flow and she has uncovered it.   The two of them shall be cut off from the people.     You shall not have intercourse with your mothers sister or your fathers sister,   because that dishonors ones own flesh; they shall bear their penalty.     If a man lies with his uncles wife, he disgraces his uncle;   they shall bear the penalty; they shall die childless.     If a man takes his brothers wife, it is severe defilement and he has disgraced his brother;   they shall be childless.    Be careful to observe all my statutes and all my decrees; otherwise the land where I am bringing you to dwell will vomit you out.       Do not conform, therefore, to the customs of the nations   whom I am driving out of your way, because all these things that they have done have filled me with disgust for them.     But to you I have said:   You shall take possession of their land. I am giving it to you to possess, a land flowing with milk and honey. I, the  Lord , am your God, who have set you apart from other peoples.      You, too, must set apart, then, the clean animals from the unclean, and the clean birds from the unclean, so that you do not make yourselves detestable through any beast or bird or any creature which creeps on the ground that I have set apart for you as unclean.     To me, therefore, you shall be holy; for I, the  Lord , am holy,   and I have set you apart from other peoples to be my own.    A man or a woman who acts as a medium or clairvoyant   shall be put to death. They shall be stoned to death; their bloodguilt is upon them.            '
