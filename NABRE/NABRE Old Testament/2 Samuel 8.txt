He also defeated Moab and measured them with a line. Making them lie down on the ground, he measured two lengths of line for death, and a full length for life.   Thus the Moabites became subject to David, paying tribute.      David then defeated Hadadezer, son of Rehob, king of Zobah, when he went to re-establish his dominion at the River.       David captured from him one thousand seven hundred horsemen and twenty thousand foot soldiers. David hamstrung all the chariot horses, but left one hundred for his chariots.       The Arameans of Damascus came to help Hadadezer, king of Zobah, but David also defeated twenty-two thousand of them in Aram.     David then placed garrisons in the Damascus region of Aram, and the Arameans became Davids subjects, paying tribute. The  Lord  brought David victory in all his undertakings.     David took the golden shields that were carried by Hadadezers attendants and brought them to Jerusalem. (These Shishak, king of Egypt, took away when he came to Jerusalem in the days of Rehoboam, son of Solomon.)     From Tebah and Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, King David removed a very large quantity of bronze.     When Toi, king of Hamath, heard that David had defeated the entire army of Hadadezer,     Toi sent his son Hadoram to wish King David well and to congratulate him on having waged a victorious war against Hadadezer; for Hadadezer had been at war with Toi. Hadoram also brought with him articles of silver, gold, and bronze.     These also King David consecrated to the  Lord  along with the silver and gold that he had taken for this purpose from all the nations he had subdued:     from Edom, Moab, the Ammonites, the Philistines, and Amalek, and from the spoils of Hadadezer, son of Rehob, king of Zobah.    On his return,   David made a name for himself by defeating eighteen thousand Edomites in the Valley of Salt.       He set up garrisons in Edom, and all the Edomites became Davids subjects. Thus the  Lord  brought David victory in all his undertakings.   Davids Officials.     David was king over all Israel; he dispensed justice and right to all his people.
