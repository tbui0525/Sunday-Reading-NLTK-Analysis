b'    Do not envy the wicked,  nor desire to be with them;   For their hearts plot violence,  and their lips speak of foul play.  By wisdom a house is built,  by understanding it is established;  And by knowledge its rooms are filled  with every precious and pleasing possession.  The wise are more powerful than the strong,  and the learned, than the mighty,   For by strategy war is waged,  and victory depends on many counselors.    Wise words are beyond fools reach,   in the assembly they do not open their mouth;  As they calculate how to do evil,  people brand them troublemakers.  The scheme of a fool gains no acceptance,  the scoffer is an abomination to the community.   Did you fail in a day of adversity,  did your strength fall short?  Did you fail to rescue those who were being dragged off to death,   those tottering, those near death,   because you said, We didnt know about it? Surely, the Searcher of hearts knows  and will repay all according to their deeds.    If you eat honey, my son, because it is good,  if pure honey is sweet to your taste,  Such, you must know, is wisdom to your soul. If you find it, you will have a future,  and your hope will not be cut off.    Do not lie in wait at the abode of the just,  do not ravage their dwelling places;  Though the just fall seven times, they rise again,  but the wicked stumble from only one mishap.   Do not rejoice when your enemies fall,  and when they stumble, do not let your heart exult,  Lest the  Lord  see it, be displeased with you,  and withdraw his wrath from your enemies.  Do not be provoked at evildoers,  do not envy the wicked;  For the evil have no future,  the lamp of the wicked will be put out.   My son, fear the  Lord  and the king;  have nothing to do with those who hate them;  For disaster will issue suddenly,  and calamity from them both, who knows when?    These also are Words of the Wise: To show partiality in judgment is not good.   Whoever says to the guilty party, You are innocent,  will be cursed by nations, scorned by peoples;  But those who render just verdicts will fare well,  and on them will come the blessing of prosperity.  An honest reply\xe2\x80\x94  a kiss on the lips.   Complete your outdoor tasks,  and arrange your work in the field;  afterward you can build your house.   Do not testify falsely against your neighbor   and so deceive with your lips.  Do not say, As they did to me, so will I do to them;   I will repay them according to their deeds.    I passed by the field of a sluggard,  by the vineyard of one with no sense;  It was all overgrown with thistles;  its surface was covered with nettles,  and its stone wall broken down.  As I gazed at it, I reflected;  I saw and learned a lesson:  A little sleep, a little slumber,   a little folding of the arms to rest\xe2\x80\x94  Then poverty will come upon you like a robber,  and want like a brigand.
