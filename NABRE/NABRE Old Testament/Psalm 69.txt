b' A Cry of Anguish in Great Distress  For the leader; according to Lilies.   Of David.   I  Save me, God,  for the waters   have reached my neck.   I have sunk into the mire of the deep,  where there is no foothold. I have gone down to the watery depths;  the flood overwhelms me.   I am weary with crying out;  my throat is parched. My eyes fail,  from looking for my God.   More numerous than the hairs of my head  are those who hate me without cause.  Those who would destroy me are mighty,  my enemies without reason. Must I now restore  what I did not steal?    II  God, you know my folly;  my faults are not hidden from you.  Let those who wait in hope for you,  Lord  of hosts,  not be shamed because of me. Let those who seek you, God of Israel,   not be disgraced because of me.  For it is on your account I bear insult,  that disgrace covers my face.   I have become an outcast to my kindred,  a stranger to my mothers children.   Because zeal for your house has consumed me,   I am scorned by those who scorn you.   When I humbled my spirit with fasting,   this led only to scorn.  When I clothed myself in sackcloth;  I became a byword for them.  Those who sit in the gate gossip about me;  drunkards make me the butt of songs.   III  But I will pray to you,  Lord ,  at a favorable time. God, in your abundant kindness, answer me  with your sure deliverance.   Rescue me from the mire,   and do not let me sink. Rescue me from those who hate me  and from the watery depths.  Do not let the flood waters overwhelm me,  nor the deep swallow me,  nor the pit close its mouth over me.  Answer me,  Lord , in your generous love;  in your great mercy turn to me.  Do not hide your face from your servant;  hasten to answer me, for I am in distress.   Come and redeem my life;  because of my enemies ransom me.  You know my reproach, my shame, my disgrace;  before you stand all my foes.  Insult has broken my heart, and I despair;  I looked for compassion, but there was none,   for comforters, but found none.  Instead they gave me poison for my food;  and for my thirst they gave me vinegar.    IV  May their own table be a snare for them,  and their communion offerings a trap.   Make their eyes so dim they cannot see;  keep their backs ever feeble.  Pour out your wrath upon them;  let the fury of your anger overtake them.  Make their camp desolate,  with none to dwell in their tents.   For they pursued the one you struck,  added to the pain of the one you wounded.  Heap punishment upon their punishment;  let them gain from you no vindication.  May they be blotted from the book of life;  not registered among the just!    V  But here I am miserable and in pain;  let your saving help protect me, God,   That I may praise Gods name in song  and glorify it with thanksgiving.  That will please the  Lord  more than oxen,  more than bulls with horns and hooves:   See, you lowly ones, and be glad;  you who seek God, take heart!   For the  Lord  hears the poor,  and does not spurn those in bondage.  Let the heaven and the earth praise him,  the seas and whatever moves in them!   VI  For God will rescue Zion,  and rebuild the cities of Judah.  They will dwell there and possess it;  the descendants of Gods servants will inherit it;  those who love Gods name will dwell in it.             '
