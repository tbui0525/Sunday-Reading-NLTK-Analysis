b'  Bildads Second Speech.    Then Bildad the Shuhite answered and said:    When will you put an end to words?  Reflect, and then we can have discussion.  Why are we accounted like beasts,  equal to them in your sight?  You who tear yourself in your anger\xe2\x80\x94  shall the earth be neglected on your account  or the rock be moved out of its place?  Truly, the light of the wicked is extinguished;  the flame of his fire casts no light.  In his tent light is darkness;  the lamp above him goes out.
