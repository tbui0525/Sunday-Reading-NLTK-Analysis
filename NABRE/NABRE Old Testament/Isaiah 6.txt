b'  Chapter 6 The Sending of Isaiah.    In the year King Uzziah died,   I saw the Lord seated on a high and lofty throne,   with the train of his garment filling the temple.     Seraphim   were stationed above; each of them had six wings: with two they covered their faces, with two they covered their feet, and with two they hovered.       One cried out to the other: Holy, holy, holy   is the  Lord  of hosts!  All the earth is filled with his glory!    At the sound of that cry, the frame of the door shook and the house was filled with smoke.      Then I said, Woe is me, I am doomed!   For I am a man of unclean lips, living among a people of unclean lips,   and my eyes have seen the King, the  Lord  of hosts!     Then one of the seraphim flew to me, holding an ember which he had taken with tongs from the altar.    He touched my mouth with it. See, he said, now that this has touched your lips,   your wickedness is removed, your sin purged.     Then I heard the voice of the Lord saying, Whom shall I send? Who will go for us? Here I am, I said; send me!      And he replied: Go and say to this people: Listen carefully, but do not understand! Look intently, but do not perceive!   Make the heart of this people sluggish,  dull their ears and close their eyes; Lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears,  and their heart understand,  and they turn and be healed.     How long, O Lord? I asked. And he replied:   Until the cities are desolate,  without inhabitants, Houses, without people,  and the land is a desolate waste.  Until the  Lord  sends the people far away,  and great is the desolation in the midst of the land.  If there remain a tenth part in it,  then this in turn shall be laid waste; As with a terebinth or an oak  whose trunk remains when its leaves have fallen.    Holy offspring is the trunk.
