b'  The Sword of the Lord.    The word of the  Lord  came to me:      Son of man, turn your face to the south: preach against the south, prophesy against the forest land in the south.     Say to the forest in the south: Hear the word of the  Lord ! Thus says the Lord  God : See! I am kindling a fire in you that shall devour every green tree as well as every dry tree. The blazing flame shall not be quenched so that from south to north every face shall be scorched by it.     All flesh shall see that I, the  Lord , have kindled it; it shall not be quenched.     But I said, Ah! Lord  God , they are saying about me, Is not this the one who is forever spinning parables?     Then the word of the  Lord  came to me:     Son of man, turn your face toward Jerusalem: preach against its sanctuary, prophesy against the land of Israel.       Say to the land of Israel: Thus says the  Lord : See! I am coming against you; I will draw my sword from its scabbard and cut off from you the righteous and the wicked.       Thus my sword shall come out from its scabbard against all flesh from south to north     and all flesh shall know that I, the  Lord , have drawn my sword from its scabbard. It cannot return again.    Act Symbolic of the Citys Fall.    As for you, son of man, groan! with shattered loins and bitter grief, groan in their sight.     When they ask you, Why are you groaning? you shall say: Because of what I heard!   When it comes every heart shall melt, every hand fall helpless; every spirit will grow faint, and every knee run with water. See, it is coming, it is here!\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the Lord  God .   Song of the Sword.    The word of the  Lord  came to me:       Son of man, prophesy! say: Thus says the  Lord : A sword, a sword has been sharpened,  a sword, a sword has been burnished:   Sharpened to make a slaughter,  burnished to flash lightning! Why should I stop now?  You have rejected the rod and every judgment!  I have given it over to the burnisher  that he might hold it in his hand, A sword sharpened and burnished  to be put in the hands of an executioner.  Cry out and howl, son of man,  for it is destined for my people, For all the princes of Israel,  victims of the sword with my people. Therefore, slap your thigh,    for it is tested, and why not? Since you rejected my staff,  should it not happen?\xe2\x80\x94  oracle of the Lord  God .  As for you, son of man, prophesy,  and clap your hands! Let the sword strike twice, a third time.  It is a sword of slaughter, A sword for slaughtering,  whirling around them all,  That every heart may tremble;  for many will be made to stumble. At all their gates  I have stationed the sword for slaughter, Made it flash lightning,  drawn for slaughter.  Slash to the right!  turn to the left,  Wherever your edge is directed!   Then I, too, shall clap my hands,   and spend my fury. I, the  Lord , have spoken.   Nebuchadnezzar at the Crossroads.    The word of the  Lord  came to me:     Son of man, make for yourself two roads over which the sword of the king of Babylon can come. Both roads shall start out from the same land. Then put a signpost at the head of each road     so the sword can come to Rabbah of the Ammonites or to Judah and its fortress, Jerusalem.     For the king of Babylon is standing at the fork of the two roads to read the omens:   he shakes out the arrows, inquires of the teraphim, inspects the liver.       Into his right hand has fallen the lot marked Jerusalem:   to order the slaughter, to raise the battle cry, to set the battering rams against the gates, to throw up a ramp, to build siege works.     In the eyes of those bound by oath this seems like a false omen; yet the lot taken in hand exposes the wickedness for which they, still bound by oath, will be taken in hand.    Therefore thus says the Lord  God : Because your guilt has been exposed, your crimes laid bare, your sinfulness revealed in all your deeds\xe2\x80\x94because you have been exposed, you shall be taken in hand.       And as for you, depraved and wicked prince of Israel, a day is coming to end your life of crime.       Thus says the Lord  God : Off with the turban and away with the crown! Nothing shall be as it was! Exalt the lowly and bring the exalted low!     A ruin, a ruin, a ruin, I shall make it! Nothing will be the same until the one comes to whom I have given it for judgment.  To the Ammonites.       As for you, son of man, prophesy: Thus says the Lord  God  to the Ammonites and their insults: O sword, sword drawn for slaughter,  burnished to consume, to flash lightning!  Your false visions and lying omens, Set you over the necks of the slain,  the wicked whose day had come\xe2\x80\x94  an end to their life of crime.  Return to your scabbard!  In the place you were created, In the land of your origin,  I will judge you.  I will pour out my anger upon you,  breathing my fiery wrath against you; I will hand you over to ravagers,  artisans of destruction!  You shall be fuel for the fire,  your blood shall flow throughout the land; You shall not be remembered,  for I, the  Lord , have spoken.            '
