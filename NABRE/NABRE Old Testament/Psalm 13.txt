b' Prayer for Help  For the leader. A psalm of David.   I  How long,  Lord ? Will you utterly forget me?  How long will you hide your face from me?   How long must I carry sorrow in my soul,  grief in my heart day after day?  How long will my enemy triumph over me?   II  Look upon me, answer me,  Lord , my God!  Give light to my eyes lest I sleep in death,  Lest my enemy say, I have prevailed,  lest my foes rejoice at my downfall.    III  But I trust in your mercy.  Grant my heart joy in your salvation, I will sing to the  Lord ,  for he has dealt bountifully with me!             '
