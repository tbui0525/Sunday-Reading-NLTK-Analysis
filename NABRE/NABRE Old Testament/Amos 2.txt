b'  Moab  Thus says the  Lord : For three crimes of Moab, and now four\xe2\x80\x94  I will not take it back\xe2\x80\x94 Because he burned to ashes   the bones of Edoms king,  I will send fire upon Moab,  and it will devour the strongholds of Kerioth; Moab shall meet death amid uproar,  battle cries and blasts of the rams horn.  I will cut off the ruler from its midst,  and all the princes I will slay with him, says the  Lord .   Judah   Thus says the  Lord : For three crimes of Judah, and now four\xe2\x80\x94  I will not take it back\xe2\x80\x94 Because they spurned the instruction of the  Lord ,   and did not keep his statutes; Because the lies   which their ancestors followed  have led them astray,  I will send fire upon Judah,  and it will devour the strongholds of Jerusalem.   Israel  Thus says the  Lord : For three crimes of Israel,   and now four\xe2\x80\x94  I will not take it back\xe2\x80\x94 Because they hand over the just for silver,  and the poor for a pair of sandals;   They trample the heads of the destitute  into the dust of the earth,  and force the lowly out of the way. Son and father sleep with the same girl,   profaning my holy name.  Upon garments taken in pledge  they recline beside any altar.   Wine at treasury expense  they drink in their temples.  Yet it was I who destroyed the Amorites before them,  who were as tall as cedars,  and as strong as oak trees. I destroyed their fruit above  and their roots beneath.   It was I who brought you up from the land of Egypt,  and who led you through the desert for forty years,  to occupy the land of the Amorites;  I who raised up prophets among your children,  and nazirites   among your young men. Is this not so, Israelites?\xe2\x80\x94  oracle of the  Lord .  But you made the nazirites drink wine,  and commanded the prophets, Do not prophesy!   Look, I am groaning beneath you,  as a wagon groans when laden with sheaves.  Flight shall elude the swift,  and the strong shall not retain strength;  The warrior shall not save his life,   nor shall the archer stand his ground; The swift of foot shall not escape,  nor shall the horseman save his life.  And the most stouthearted of warriors  shall flee naked on that day\xe2\x80\x94  oracle of the  Lord .            '
