b'  Migration to Egypt.     Israel set out with all that was his. When he arrived at Beer-sheba, he offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac.     There God, speaking to Israel in a vision by night, called: Jacob! Jacob! He answered, Here I am.     Then he said: I am God,   the God of your father. Do not be afraid to go down to Egypt, for there I will make you a great nation.     I will go down to Egypt with you and I will also bring you back here, after Joseph has closed your eyes.    So Jacob departed from Beer-sheba, and the sons of Israel put their father and their wives and children on the wagons that Pharaoh had sent to transport him.     They took with them their livestock and the possessions they had acquired in the land of Canaan. So Jacob and all his descendants came to Egypt.

Israel had sent Judah ahead to Joseph, so that he might meet him in Goshen. On his arrival in the region of Goshen,     Joseph prepared his chariot and went up to meet his father Israel in Goshen. As soon as Israel made his appearance, Joseph threw his arms around him and wept a long time on his shoulder.     And Israel said to Joseph, At last I can die, now that I have seen for myself that you are still alive.    Joseph then said to his brothers and his fathers household: I will go up and inform Pharaoh, telling him: My brothers and my fathers household, whose home is in the land of Canaan, have come to me.     The men are shepherds, having been owners of livestock;   and they have brought with them their flocks and herds, as well as everything else they own.     So when Pharaoh summons you and asks what your occupation is,     you must answer, We your servants, like our ancestors, have been owners of livestock from our youth until now, in order that you may stay in the region of Goshen, since all shepherds are abhorrent to the Egyptians.
