b'   All this my eye has seen;  my ear has heard and perceived it.  What you know, I also know;   I do not fall short of you.  But I would speak with the Almighty;   I want to argue with God.  But you gloss over falsehoods,  you are worthless physicians, every one of you!  Oh, that you would be altogether silent;  that for you would be wisdom!  Hear now my argument  and listen to the accusations from my lips.  Is it for God that you speak falsehood?  Is it for him that you utter deceit?  Is it for him that you show partiality?  Do you make accusations on behalf of God?  Will it be well when he shall search you out?  Can you deceive him as you do a mere human being?  He will openly rebuke you  if in secret you show partiality.  Surely his majesty will frighten you  and dread of him fall upon you.

Then call me, and I will respond;  or let me speak first, and answer me.  What are my faults and my sins?  My misdeed, my sin make known to me!  Why do you hide your face  and consider me your enemy?    Will you harass a wind-driven leaf  or pursue a withered straw?  For you draw up bitter indictments against me,  and punish in me the faults of my youth.  You put my feet in the stocks;  you watch all my paths  and trace out all my footsteps,  Though I wear out like a leather bottle,  like a garment the moth has consumed.            '
