b'  The Desolation of Jerusalem   How solitary sits the city,  once filled with people. She who was great among the nations  is now like a widow. Once a princess among the provinces,  now a toiling slave.    She weeps incessantly in the night,  her cheeks damp with tears. She has no one to comfort her  from all her lovers;  Her friends have all betrayed her,  and become her enemies.     Judah has gone into exile,  after oppression and harsh labor; She dwells among the nations,  yet finds no rest:  All her pursuers overtake her  in the narrow straits.    The roads to Zion mourn,  empty of pilgrims to her feasts. All her gateways are desolate,  her priests groan, Her young women grieve;  her lot is bitter.     Her foes have come out on top,  her enemies are secure; Because the  Lord  has afflicted her  for her many rebellions. Her children have gone away,  captive before the foe.    From daughter Zion has gone  all her glory: Her princes have become like rams  that find no pasture. They have gone off exhausted  before their pursuers.    Jerusalem remembers  in days of wretched homelessness, All the precious things she once had  in days gone by. But when her people fell into the hands of the foe,  and she had no help, Her foes looked on and laughed  at her collapse.    Jerusalem has sinned grievously,  therefore she has become a mockery; Those who honored her now demean her,  for they saw her nakedness; She herself groans out loud,  and turns away.     Her uncleanness is on her skirt;  she has no thought of her future. Her downfall is astonishing,  with no one to comfort her. Look, O  Lord , at my misery;  how the enemy triumphs!     The foe stretched out his hands  to all her precious things; She has seen the nations  enter her sanctuary, Those you forbade to come  into your assembly.     All her people groan,  searching for bread; They give their precious things for food,  to retain the breath of life. Look, O  Lord , and pay attention  to how I have been demeaned!    Come, all who pass by the way,  pay attention and see: Is there any pain like my pain,  which has been ruthlessly inflicted upon me, With which the  Lord  has tormented me  on the day of his blazing wrath?    From on high he hurled fire down  into my very bones; He spread out a net for my feet,  and turned me back. He has left me desolate,  in misery all day long.     The yoke of my rebellions is bound together,  fastened by his hand. His yoke is upon my neck;  he has made my strength fail. The Lord has delivered me into the grip  of those I cannot resist.    All my valiant warriors  my Lord has cast away; He proclaimed a feast against me  to crush my young men; My Lord has trodden in the wine press  virgin daughter Judah.    For these things I weep\xe2\x80\x94My eyes! My eyes!  They stream with tears! How far from me is anyone to comfort,  anyone to restore my life. My children are desolate;  the enemy has prevailed.     Zion stretches out her hands,  with no one to comfort her; The  Lord  has ordered against Jacob  his foes all around; Jerusalem has become in their midst  a thing unclean.    The  Lord  is in the right;  I had defied his command. Listen, all you peoples,  and see my pain: My young women and young men  have gone into captivity.     I cried out to my lovers,  but they failed me.  My priests and my elders  perished in the city; How desperately they searched for food,  to save their lives!    Look, O  Lord , at the anguish I suffer!  My stomach churns, And my heart recoils within me:  How bitter I am! Outside the sword bereaves\xe2\x80\x94  indoors, there is death.     Hear how I am groaning;  there is no one to comfort me. All my enemies hear of my misery and rejoice  over what you have done. Bring on the day you proclaimed,  and let them become like me!    Let all their evil come before you  and deal with them As you have so ruthlessly dealt with me  for all my rebellions. My groans are many,  my heart is sick.             '
