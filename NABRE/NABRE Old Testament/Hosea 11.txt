b'  The Disappointment of a Parent   When Israel was a child I loved him,   out of Egypt   I called my son.   The more I called them,  the farther they went from me, Sacrificing to the Baals  and burning incense to idols.  Yet it was I who taught Ephraim to walk,  who took them in my arms;   but they did not know that I cared for them.  I drew them with human cords,  with bands of love;  I fostered them like those  who raise an infant to their cheeks;  I bent down to feed them.     He shall return to the land of Egypt,   Assyria shall be his king,  because they have refused to repent.  The sword shall rage in his cities:  it shall destroy his diviners,  and devour them because of their schemings.  My people have their mind set on apostasy;  though they call on God in unison,  he shall not raise them up.   But Love Is Stronger and Restores  How could I give you up, Ephraim,  or deliver you up, Israel? How could I treat you as Admah,  or make you like Zeboiim?   My heart is overwhelmed,  my pity is stirred.  I will not give vent to my blazing anger,  I will not destroy Ephraim again; For I am God and not a man,   the Holy One present among you;  I will not come in wrath.  They shall follow the  Lord ,  who roars like a lion;  When he roars,  his children shall come frightened from the west,  Out of Egypt they shall come trembling, like birds,  like doves, from the land of Assyria; And I will resettle them in their homes,  oracle of the  Lord .
