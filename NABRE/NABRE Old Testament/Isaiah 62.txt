b'  A New Name for Zion   For Zions sake I will not be silent,  for Jerusalems sake I will not keep still, Until her vindication shines forth like the dawn  and her salvation like a burning torch.   Nations shall behold your vindication,  and all kings your glory; You shall be called by a new name  bestowed by the mouth of the  Lord .   You shall be a glorious crown in the hand of the  Lord ,  a royal diadem in the hand of your God.  No more shall you be called Forsaken,  nor your land called Desolate, But you shall be called My Delight is in her,  and your land Espoused. For the  Lord  delights in you,  and your land shall be espoused.   For as a young man marries a virgin,  your Builder shall marry you; And as a bridegroom rejoices in his bride  so shall your God rejoice in you.  Upon your walls, Jerusalem,  I have stationed sentinels; By day and by night,  they shall never be silent. You who are to remind the  Lord ,  take no rest,  And give him no rest,  until he re-establishes Jerusalem And makes it the praise of the earth.   The Blessings of Salvation for Gods People   The  Lord  has sworn by his right hand  and by his mighty arm: No more will I give your grain  as food to your enemies; Nor shall foreigners drink the wine,  for which you toiled.   But those who harvest shall eat,  and praise the  Lord ; Those who gather shall drink  in my holy courts.    Pass through, pass through the gates,  prepare a way for the people;  Build up, build up the highway, clear it of stones,  raise up a standard over the nations.  The  Lord  has proclaimed  to the ends of the earth: Say to daughter Zion,  See, your savior comes! See, his reward is with him,  his recompense before him.   They shall be called The Holy People,  The Redeemed of the  Lord . And you shall be called Cared For,  A City Not Forsaken.             '
