b'   Arrival at Sinai.     In the third month after the Israelites departure from the land of Egypt, on the first day, they came to the wilderness of Sinai.     After they made the journey from Rephidim and entered the wilderness of Sinai, they then pitched camp in the wilderness.  While Israel was encamped there in front of the mountain,     Moses went up to the mountain of God. Then the  Lord  called to him from the mountain, saying: This is what you will say to the house of Jacob; tell the Israelites:     You have seen how I treated the Egyptians and how I bore you up on eagles wings and brought you to myself.       Now, if you obey me completely and keep my covenant,   you will be my treasured possession among all peoples,   though all the earth is mine.     You will be to me a kingdom of priests,   a holy nation.   That is what you must tell the Israelites.     So Moses went and summoned the elders of the people. When he set before them all that the  Lord  had ordered him to tell them,     all the people answered together, Everything the  Lord  has said, we will do. Then Moses brought back to the  Lord  the response of the people.    The  Lord  said to Moses: I am coming to you now in a dense cloud,   so that when the people hear me speaking with you, they will also remain faithful to you. When Moses, then, had reported the response of the people to the  Lord ,     the  Lord  said to Moses: Go to the people and have them sanctify themselves today and tomorrow. Have them wash their garments     and be ready for the third day; for on the third day the  Lord  will come down on Mount Sinai in the sight of all the people.     Set limits for the people all around,   saying: Take care not to go up the mountain, or even to touch its edge. All who touch the mountain must be put to death.     No hand shall touch them, but they must be stoned to death or killed with arrows. Whether human being or beast, they must not be allowed to live. Only when the rams horn sounds may they go up on the mountain.       Then Moses came down from the mountain to the people and had them sanctify themselves, and they washed their garments.     He said to the people, Be ready for the third day. Do not approach a woman.   The Great Theophany.     On the morning of the third day there were peals of thunder and lightning, and a heavy cloud over the mountain, and a very loud blast of the shofar,   so that all the people in the camp trembled.     But Moses led the people out of the camp to meet God, and they stationed themselves at the foot of the mountain.     Now Mount Sinai was completely enveloped in smoke, because the  Lord  had come down upon it in fire. The smoke rose from it as though from a kiln, and the whole mountain trembled violently.     The blast of the shofar grew louder and louder, while Moses was speaking and God was answering him with thunder.     When the  Lord  came down upon Mount Sinai, to the top of the mountain, the  Lord  summoned Moses to the top of the mountain, and Moses went up.     Then the  Lord  told Moses: Go down and warn the people not to break through to the  Lord  in order to see him; otherwise many of them will be struck down.     For their part, the priests, who approach the  Lord  must sanctify themselves; else the  Lord  will break out in anger against them.     But Moses said to the  Lord , The people cannot go up to Mount Sinai, for you yourself warned us, saying: Set limits around the mountain to make it sacred.     So the  Lord  said to him: Go down and come up along with Aaron. But do not let the priests and the people break through to come up to the  Lord ; else he will break out against them.     So Moses went down to the people and spoke to them.            '
