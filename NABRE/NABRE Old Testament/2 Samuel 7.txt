b'  The Oracle of Nathan.     After the king had taken up residence in his house, and the  Lord  had given him rest from his enemies on every side,       the king said to Nathan the prophet, Here I am living in a house of cedar, but the ark of God dwells in a tent!       Nathan answered the king, Whatever is in your heart, go and do, for the  Lord  is with you.       But that same night the word of the  Lord  came to Nathan:     Go and tell David my servant, Thus says the  Lord : Is it you who would build me a house to dwell in?       I have never dwelt in a house from the day I brought Israel up from Egypt to this day, but I have been going about in a tent or a tabernacle.     As long as I have wandered about among the Israelites, did I ever say a word to any of the judges whom I commanded to shepherd my people Israel: Why have you not built me a house of cedar?    Now then, speak thus to my servant David, Thus says the  Lord  of hosts:   I took you from the pasture, from following the flock, to become ruler over my people Israel.       I was with you wherever you went, and I cut down all your enemies before you. And I will make your name like that of the greatest on earth.       I will assign a place for my people Israel and I will plant them in it to dwell there; they will never again be disturbed, nor shall the wicked ever again oppress them, as they did at the beginning,     and from the day when I appointed judges over my people Israel. I will give you rest from all your enemies. Moreover, the  Lord  also declares to you that the  Lord  will make a house for you:        when your days have been completed and you rest with your ancestors, I will raise up your offspring after you, sprung from your loins, and I will establish his kingdom.     He it is   who shall build a house for my name, and I will establish his royal throne forever.     I will be a father to him, and he shall be a son to me. If he does wrong, I will reprove him with a human rod and with human punishments;       but I will not withdraw my favor from him as I withdrew it from Saul who was before you.       Your house and your kingdom are firm forever before me; your throne shall be firmly established forever.        In accordance with all these words and this whole vision Nathan spoke to David.   Davids Thanksgiving.    Then King David went in and sat in the  Lord s presence and said, Who am I, Lord  God , and what is my house, that you should have brought me so far?       And yet even this is too little in your sight, Lord  God ! For you have made a promise regarding your servants house reaching into the future, and giving guidance to the people, Lord  God !     What more can David say to you? You know   your servant, Lord  God !     For your servants sake and as you have had at heart, you have brought about this whole magnificent disclosure to your servant.     Therefore, great are you, Lord  God ! There is no one like you, no God but you, as we have always heard.       What other nation on earth is there like your people Israel? What god has ever led a nation, redeeming it as his people and making a name by great and awesome deeds, as you drove out the nations and their gods before your people, whom you redeemed for yourself from Egypt?        You have established for yourself your people Israel as your people forever, and you,  Lord , have become their God.     Now,  Lord  God, confirm the promise that you have spoken concerning your servant and his house forever. Bring about what you have promised     so that your name may be forever great. People will say: The  Lord  of hosts is God over Israel, when the house of your servant David is established in your presence.     Because you,  Lord  of hosts, God of Israel, have revealed to your servant, I will build you a house, your servant now finds the courage to make this prayer before you.     Since you, Lord  God , are truly God and your words are truth and you have made this generous promise to your servant,       do, then, bless the house of your servant, that it may be in your presence forever\xe2\x80\x94since you, Lord  God , have promised, and by your blessing the house of your servant shall be blessed forever.
