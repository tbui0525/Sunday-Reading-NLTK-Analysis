b'   Salvation for the Just     Thus says the  Lord : Observe what is right, do what is just,  for my salvation is about to come,  my justice, about to be revealed.   Happy is the one who does this,  whoever holds fast to it: Keeping the sabbath without profaning it,  keeping ones hand from doing any evil.    Obligations and Promises to Share in the Covenant   The foreigner joined to the  Lord  should not say,  The  Lord  will surely exclude me from his people; Nor should the eunuch say,  See, I am a dry tree.    For thus says the  Lord : To the eunuchs who keep my sabbaths,  who choose what pleases me,  and who hold fast to my covenant,   I will give them, in my house  and within my walls, a monument and a name  Better than sons and daughters;  an eternal name, which shall not be cut off, will I give them.  And foreigners who join themselves to the  Lord ,  to minister to him, To love the name of the  Lord ,  to become his servants\xe2\x80\x94 All who keep the sabbath without profaning it  and hold fast to my covenant,   Them I will bring to my holy mountain  and make them joyful in my house of prayer; Their burnt offerings and their sacrifices  will be acceptable on my altar, For my house shall be called  a house of prayer for all peoples.    Oracle of the Lord  God ,  who gathers the dispersed of Israel\xe2\x80\x94 Others will I gather to them  besides those already gathered.    Unworthy Shepherds   All you beasts of the field,   come to devour,  all you beasts in the forest!    All the sentinels of Israel are blind,  they are without knowledge; They are all mute dogs,  unable to bark; Dreaming, reclining,  loving their sleep.  Yes, the dogs have a ravenous appetite;  they never know satiety, Shepherds who have no understanding;  all have turned their own way,  each one covetous for gain:  Come, let me bring wine;  let us fill ourselves with strong drink, And tomorrow will be like today,  or even greater.
