b'  The Sanctuary Light.     The  Lord  said to Moses:     Order the Israelites to bring you clear oil of crushed olives for the light, so that you may keep the lamp burning regularly.       In the tent of meeting, outside the veil that hangs in front of the covenant, Aaron shall set up the lamp to burn before the  Lord  regularly, from evening till morning, by a perpetual statute throughout your generations.     He shall set up the lamps on the pure gold menorah to burn regularly before the  Lord . The Showbread.       You shall take bran flour and bake it into twelve cakes,   using two tenths of an ephah of flour for each cake.     These you shall place in two piles, six in each pile, on the pure gold table before the  Lord .     With each pile put some pure frankincense, which shall serve as an oblation to the  Lord , a token of the bread offering.     Regularly on each sabbath day the bread   shall be set out before the  Lord  on behalf of the Israelites by an everlasting covenant.     It shall belong to Aaron and his sons, who must eat it in a sacred place, since it is most sacred,   his as a perpetual due from the oblations to the  Lord . Punishment of Blasphemy.       A man born of an Israelite mother and an Egyptian father went out among the Israelites, and in the camp a fight broke out between the son of the Israelite woman and an Israelite man.     The son of the Israelite woman uttered the  Lord s name in a curse and blasphemed. So he was brought to Moses\xe2\x80\x94now his mothers name was Shelomith, daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan\xe2\x80\x94     and he was kept in custody till a decision from the  Lord  should settle the case for them.       The  Lord  then said to Moses:     Take the blasphemer outside the camp, and when all who heard him have laid their hands   on his head,   let the whole community stone him.     Tell the Israelites: Anyone who blasphemes God shall bear the penalty;     whoever utters the name of the  Lord  in a curse shall be put to death.   The whole community shall stone that person; alien and native-born alike must be put to death for uttering the  Lord s name in a curse.     Whoever takes the life of any human being shall be put to death;       whoever takes the life of an animal shall make restitution of another animal, life for a life.        Anyone who inflicts a permanent injury on his or her neighbor shall receive the same in return:     fracture for fracture, eye for eye, tooth for tooth. The same injury that one gives another shall be inflicted in return.       Whoever takes the life of an animal shall make restitution, but whoever takes a human life shall be put to death.     You shall have but one rule, for alien and native-born alike.   I, the  Lord , am your God.    When Moses told this to the Israelites, they took the blasphemer outside the camp and stoned him;   they did just as the  Lord  commanded Moses.            '
