b'   I will stand at my guard post,  and station myself upon the rampart;  I will keep watch to see what he will say to me,  and what answer he will give to my complaint.   Gods Response  Then the  Lord  answered me and said:  Write down the vision;   Make it plain upon tablets,  so that the one who reads it may run.  For the vision is a witness for the appointed time,  a testimony to the end; it will not disappoint. If it delays, wait for it,  it will surely come, it will not be late.  See, the rash have no integrity;  but the just one who is righteous because of faith shall live.     Sayings Against Tyrants   Indeed wealth is treacherous;  a proud man does not succeed. He who opens wide his throat like Sheol,  and is insatiable as death, Who gathers to himself all the nations,  and collects for himself all the peoples\xe2\x80\x94  Shall not all these take up a taunt against him,   and make a riddle about him, saying:   Ah! you who store up what is not yours  \xe2\x80\x94how long can it last!\xe2\x80\x94  you who load yourself down with collateral.

The cup from the  Lord s right hand shall come around to you,  and utter shame shall cover your glory.  For the violence done to Lebanon   shall cover you,   and the destruction of the animals shall terrify you; Because of the shedding of human blood,  and violence done to the land,  to the city and to all who live in it.    Of what use is the carved image,   that its maker should carve it? Or the molten image, the lying oracle,  that its very maker should trust in it,  and make mute idols?  Ah! you who say to wood, Awake!  to silent stone, Arise!  Can any such thing give oracles?  It is only overlaid with gold and silver,  there is no breath in it at all.
