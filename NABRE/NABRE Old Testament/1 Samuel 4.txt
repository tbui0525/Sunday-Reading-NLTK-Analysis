Israel went out to engage them in battle and camped at Ebenezer, while the Philistines camped at Aphek.     The Philistines then drew up in battle formation against Israel. After a fierce struggle Israel was defeated by the Philistines, who killed about four thousand men on the battlefield.

The Philistines, hearing the uproar, asked, What does this loud shouting in the camp of the Hebrews mean? On learning that the ark of the  Lord  had come into the camp,     the Philistines were frightened, crying out, Gods have come to their camp. Woe to us! This has never happened before.     Woe to us!
