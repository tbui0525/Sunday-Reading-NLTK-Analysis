b' The Holy King I  The  Lord  is king, the peoples tremble;  he is enthroned on the cherubim,   the earth quakes.   Great is the  Lord  in Zion,  exalted above all the peoples.  Let them praise your great and awesome name:  Holy is he!    II  O mighty king, lover of justice,  you have established fairness;  you have created just rule in Jacob.   Exalt the  Lord , our God;  bow down before his footstool;    holy is he!   III  Moses and Aaron were among his priests,  Samuel among those who called on his name;  they called on the  Lord , and he answered them.   From the pillar of cloud he spoke to them;  they kept his decrees, the law he had given them.   O  Lord , our God, you answered them;  you were a forgiving God to them,  though you punished their offenses.   Exalt the  Lord , our God;  bow down before his holy mountain;  holy is the  Lord , our God.            '
