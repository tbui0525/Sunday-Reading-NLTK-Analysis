b' Security Under Gods Protection I  You who dwell in the shelter of the Most High,   who abide in the shade of the Almighty,  Say to the  Lord , My refuge and fortress,  my God in whom I trust.   He will rescue you from the fowlers snare,  from the destroying plague,  He will shelter you with his pinions,  and under his wings you may take refuge;   his faithfulness is a protecting shield.  You shall not fear the terror of the night  nor the arrow that flies by day,   Nor the pestilence that roams in darkness,  nor the plague that ravages at noon.   Though a thousand fall at your side,  ten thousand at your right hand,  near you it shall not come.  You need simply watch;  the punishment of the wicked you will see.   Because you have the  Lord  for your refuge  and have made the Most High your stronghold,  No evil shall befall you,  no affliction come near your tent.    For he commands his angels with regard to you,   to guard you wherever you go.   With their hands they shall support you,  lest you strike your foot against a stone.   You can tread upon the asp and the viper,  trample the lion and the dragon.    II  Because he clings to me I will deliver him;  because he knows my name I will set him on high.   He will call upon me and I will answer;   I will be with him in distress;   I will deliver him and give him honor.  With length of days I will satisfy him,  and fill him with my saving power.             '
