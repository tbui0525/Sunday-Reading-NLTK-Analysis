b'  I  Why,  Lord , do you stand afar  and pay no heed in times of trouble?  Arrogant scoundrels pursue the poor;  they trap them by their cunning schemes.    II  The wicked even boast of their greed;  these robbers curse and scorn the  Lord .   In their insolence the wicked boast:  God does not care; there is no God.    Yet their affairs always succeed;  they ignore your judgment on high;  they sneer at all who oppose them.  They say in their hearts, We will never fall;  never will we see misfortune.  Their mouths are full of oaths, violence, and lies;  discord and evil are under their tongues.   They wait in ambush near towns;  their eyes watch for the helpless  to murder the innocent in secret.   They lurk in ambush like lions in a thicket,  hide there to trap the poor,  snare them and close the net.   The helpless are crushed, laid low;  they fall into the power of the wicked,  Who say in their hearts, God has forgotten,  shows no concern, never bothers to look.    III  Rise up,  Lord ! God, lift up your hand!  Do not forget the poor!  Why should the wicked scorn God,  say in their hearts, God does not care?  But you do see;  you take note of misery and sorrow;   you take the matter in hand. To you the helpless can entrust their cause;  you are the defender of orphans.   Break the arm of the wicked and depraved;  make them account for their crimes;  let none of them survive.   IV  The  Lord  is king forever;   the nations have vanished from his land.  You listen,  Lord , to the needs of the poor;  you strengthen their heart and incline your ear.  You win justice for the orphaned and oppressed;   no one on earth will cause terror again.        '
