b' Prayer for Divine Help  For the leader; of David. For remembrance.    Graciously rescue me, God!   Come quickly to help me,  Lord !   Let those who seek my life  be confused and put to shame.  Let those who desire my ruin  turn back in disgrace.  Let those who say Aha!   turn back in their shame.  But may all who seek you  rejoice and be glad in you, Those who long for your help  always say, God be glorified!   I am miserable and poor.  God, come to me quickly! You are my help and deliverer.  Lord , do not delay!            '
