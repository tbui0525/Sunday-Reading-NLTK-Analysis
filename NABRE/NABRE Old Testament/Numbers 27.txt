b'  Zelophehads Daughters.    The daughters of Zelophehad, son of Hepher, son of Gilead, son of Machir, son of Manasseh, came forward. (Zelophehad belonged to the clans of Manasseh, son of Joseph.) The names of his daughters were Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah and Tirzah.       Standing before Moses, Eleazar the priest, the princes, and the whole community at the entrance of the tent of meeting, they said:     Our father died in the wilderness. Although he did not join the faction of those who conspired against the  Lord ,   Korahs faction, he died for his own sin without leaving any sons.     But why should our fathers name be cut off from his clan merely because he had no son? Give us land among our fathers kindred. Laws Concerning Heiresses.       So Moses laid their case before the  Lord ,     and the  Lord  said to him:     The plea of Zelophehads daughters is just; you shall give them hereditary land among their fathers kindred and transfer their fathers heritage to them.     Tell the Israelites: If a man dies without leaving a son, you shall transfer his heritage to his daughter;     if he has no daughter, you shall give his heritage to his brothers;     if he has no brothers, you shall give his heritage to his fathers brothers;     if his father had no brothers, you shall give his heritage to his nearest relative in his clan, who shall then take possession of it. This will be the statutory procedure for the Israelites, as the  Lord  commanded Moses.    Joshua to Succeed Moses.

Then Moses said to the  Lord ,     May the  Lord , the God of the spirits of all humanity,   set over the community someone     who will be their leader in battle and who will lead them out and bring them in, that the  Lord s community may not be like sheep without a shepherd.     And the  Lord  replied to Moses: Take Joshua, son of Nun,   a man of spirit,   and lay your hand upon him.     Have him stand before Eleazar the priest and the whole community, and commission him in their sight.     Invest him with some of your own power, that the whole Israelite community may obey him.     He shall present himself to Eleazar the priest, who will seek for him the decision of the Urim   in the  Lord s presence; and as it directs, Joshua, all the Israelites with him, and the whole community will go out for battle; and as it directs, they will come in.    Moses did as the  Lord  had commanded him. Taking Joshua and having him stand before Eleazar the priest and the whole community,     he laid his hands on him and commissioned him, as the  Lord  had directed through Moses.            '
