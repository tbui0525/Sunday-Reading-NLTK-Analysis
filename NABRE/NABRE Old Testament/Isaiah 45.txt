b'   Thus says the  Lord  to his anointed,   Cyrus,  whose right hand I grasp, Subduing nations before him,  stripping kings of their strength, Opening doors before him,  leaving the gates unbarred:  I will go before you  and level the mountains; Bronze doors   I will shatter,  iron bars I will snap.   I will give you treasures of darkness,  riches hidden away, That you may know I am the  Lord ,  the God of Israel, who calls you by name.    For the sake of Jacob, my servant,  of Israel my chosen one, I have called you by name,  giving you a title, though you do not know me.   I am the  Lord , there is no other,  there is no God besides me. It is I who arm you, though you do not know me,   so that all may know, from the rising of the sun  to its setting, that there is none besides me.  I am the  Lord , there is no other.   I form the light, and create the darkness, I make weal and create woe;   I, the  Lord , do all these things.  Let justice descend, you heavens, like dew from above,  like gentle rain let the clouds drop it down. Let the earth open and salvation bud forth;  let righteousness spring up with them!   I, the  Lord , have created this.   Woe to anyone who contends with their Maker;   a potsherd among potsherds of the earth!  Shall the clay say to the potter, What are you doing?  or, What you are making has no handles?  Woe to anyone who asks a father, What are you begetting?  or a woman, What are you giving birth to?  Thus says the  Lord ,  the Holy One of Israel, his maker: Do you question me about my children,  tell me how to treat the work of my hands?  It was I who made the earth  and created the people upon it; It was my hands that stretched out the heavens;  I gave the order to all their host.  It was I who stirred him   up for justice;  all his ways I make level. He shall rebuild my city  and let my exiles go free Without price or payment,  says the  Lord  of hosts.     Thus says the  Lord : The earnings of Egypt, the gain of Ethiopia,  and the Sabeans,   tall of stature, Shall come over to you and belong to you;  they shall follow you, coming in chains. Before you they shall bow down,  saying in prayer: With you alone is God; and there is none other,  no other god!   Truly with you God is hidden,   the God of Israel, the savior!   They are put to shame and disgrace, all of them;  they go in disgrace who carve images.  Israel has been saved by the  Lord ,  saved forever! You shall never be put to shame or disgrace  in any future age.     For thus says the  Lord , The creator of the heavens,  who is God, The designer and maker of the earth  who established it, Not as an empty waste   did he create it,  but designing it to be lived in: I am the  Lord , and there is no other.   I have not spoken in secret  from some place in the land of darkness, I have not said to the descendants of Jacob,  Look for me in an empty waste. I, the  Lord , promise justice,  I declare what is right.    Come and assemble, gather together,  you fugitives from among the nations! They are without knowledge who bear wooden idols   and pray to gods that cannot save.  Come close and declare;  let them take counsel together: Who announced this from the beginning,  declared it from of old? Was it not I, the  Lord ,  besides whom there is no other God?  There is no just and saving God but me.    Turn to me and be safe,  all you ends of the earth,  for I am God; there is no other!  By myself I swear,  uttering my just decree,  a word that will not return: To me every knee shall bend;  by me every tongue shall swear,   Saying, Only in the  Lord  are just deeds and power. Before him in shame shall come  all who vent their anger against him.  In the  Lord  all the descendants of Israel  shall have vindication and glory.            '
