b'   Then he made a bronze altar twenty cubits long, twenty cubits wide and ten cubits high.        He also made the molten sea. It was made with a circular rim, and measured ten cubits across, five in height, and thirty in circumference.     Under the brim a ring of figures of oxen   encircled it for ten cubits, all the way around the compass of the sea; there were two rows of oxen cast in one mold with the sea.     This rested on twelve oxen, three facing north, three facing west, three facing south, and three facing east, with their haunches all toward the center; upon them was set the sea.     It was a handbreadth thick, and its brim resembled that of a cup, being lily-shaped. It had a capacity of three thousand baths.     Then he made ten basins for washing, placing five of them to the right and five to the left. In these the victims for the burnt offerings were washed; but the sea was for the priests to wash in.     He made the menorahs of gold, ten of them as was prescribed, and placed them in the nave, five to the right and five to the left.       He made ten tables and had them set in the nave, five to the right and five to the left; and he made a hundred golden bowls.       He made the court of the priests and the great courtyard   and the gates of the courtyard; the gates he covered with bronze.     The sea he placed off to the southeast from the south side of the house.      When Huram had made the pots, shovels, and bowls, he finished all his work for King Solomon in the house of God:     two columns; two nodes for the capitals on top of the columns; and two pieces of netting covering the two nodes for the capitals on top of the columns;     four hundred pomegranates in double rows on both pieces of netting that covered the two nodes of the capitals on top of the columns.     He made the stands, and the basins on the stands;     one sea, and the twelve oxen under it;     pots, shovels, forks, and all the articles Huram-abi made for King Solomon for the house of the  Lord ; they were of burnished bronze.     The king had them cast in the neighborhood of the Jordan, between Succoth and Zeredah, in thick clay molds.     Solomon made all these vessels, so many in number that the weight of the bronze could not be determined.    Solomon made all the articles that were for the house of God: the golden altar, the tables on which the showbread lay,     the menorahs and their lamps of pure gold which were to burn as prescribed before the inner sanctuary,     flowers, lamps, and gold tongs (this was of purest gold),     snuffers, bowls, cups, and firepans of pure gold. As for the entrance to the house, its inner doors to the holy of holies, as well as the doors to the nave of the temple, were of gold.            '
