b'  Exhortation to Righteousness, the Key to Life  Love righteousness,   you who judge the earth;   think of the  Lord  in goodness,  and seek him in integrity of heart;   Because he is found by those who do not test him,  and manifests himself to those who do not disbelieve him.   For perverse counsels separate people from God,  and his power, put to the proof, rebukes the foolhardy;    Because into a soul that plots evil wisdom does not enter,  nor does she dwell in a body under debt of sin.   For the holy spirit of discipline   flees deceit  and withdraws from senseless counsels  and is rebuked when unrighteousness occurs.     For wisdom is a kindly spirit,  yet she does not acquit blasphemous lips; Because God is the witness of the inmost self   and the sure observer of the heart  and the listener to the tongue.   For the spirit of the  Lord  fills the world,   is all-embracing, and knows whatever is said.  Therefore those who utter wicked things will not go unnoticed,  nor will chastising condemnation pass them by.   For the devices of the wicked shall be scrutinized,  and the sound of their words shall reach the  Lord ,  for the chastisement of their transgressions;  Because a jealous ear hearkens to everything,   and discordant grumblings are not secret.  Therefore guard against profitless grumbling,  and from calumny   withhold your tongues; For a stealthy utterance will not go unpunished,  and a lying mouth destroys the soul.    Do not court death   by your erring way of life,  nor draw to yourselves destruction by the works of your hands.  Because God did not make death,   nor does he rejoice in the destruction of the living.  For he fashioned all things that they might have being,  and the creatures of the world are wholesome; There is not a destructive drug among them  nor any domain of Hades   on earth,  For righteousness is undying.     The Wicked Reject Immortality and Righteousness Alike  It was the wicked who with hands and words invited death,  considered it a friend, and pined for it,  and made a covenant with it, Because they deserve to be allied with it.
