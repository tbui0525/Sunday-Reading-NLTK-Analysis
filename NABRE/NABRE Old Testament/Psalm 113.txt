b' Praise of Gods Care for the Poor  Hallelujah! I Praise, you servants of the  Lord ,  praise the name of the  Lord .   Blessed be the name of the  Lord  both now and forever.  From the rising of the sun to its setting   let the name of the  Lord  be praised.   II  High above all nations is the  Lord ;  above the heavens his glory.   Who is like the  Lord  our God,  enthroned on high,    looking down on heaven and earth?  He raises the needy from the dust,  lifts the poor from the ash heap,   Seats them with princes,  the princes of the people,  Gives the childless wife a home,  the joyful mother of children.  Hallelujah!            '
