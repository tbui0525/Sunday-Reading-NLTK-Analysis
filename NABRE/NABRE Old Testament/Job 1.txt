b'   Jobs Piety.    In the land of Uz   there was a blameless and upright man named Job,   who feared God and avoided evil.     Seven sons and three daughters were born to him;     and he had seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen, five hundred she-donkeys, and a very large household, so that he was greater than anyone in the East.       His sons used to take turns giving feasts, sending invitations to their three sisters to eat and drink with them.     And when each feast had run its course, Job would send for them and sanctify them, rising early and offering sacrifices for every one of them. For Job said, It may be that my children have sinned and cursed   God in their hearts. Job did this habitually.   The Interview Between the Lord and the Satan.     One day, when the sons of God   came to present themselves before the  Lord , the satan also came among them.       The  Lord  said to the satan, Where have you been? Then the satan answered the  Lord  and said,   Roaming the earth and patrolling it.     The  Lord  said to the satan, Have you noticed my servant Job? There is no one on earth like him, blameless and upright, fearing God and avoiding evil.     The satan answered the  Lord  and said, Is it for nothing that Job is God-fearing?     Have you not surrounded him and his family and all that he has with your protection? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his livestock are spread over the land.      But now put forth your hand and touch all that he has, and surely he will curse you to your face.     The  Lord  said to the satan, Very well, all that he has is in your power; only do not lay a hand on him. So the satan went forth from the presence of the  Lord .   The First Trial.    One day, while his sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in the house of their eldest brother,     a messenger came to Job and said, The oxen were plowing and the donkeys grazing beside them,     and the Sabeans   carried them off in a raid. They put the servants to the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell you.     He was still speaking when another came and said, Gods fire has fallen from heaven and struck the sheep and the servants and consumed them; I alone have escaped to tell you.     He was still speaking when another came and said, The Chaldeans   formed three columns, seized the camels, carried them off, and put the servants to the sword; I alone have escaped to tell you.     He was still speaking when another came and said, Your sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in the house of their eldest brother,     and suddenly a great wind came from across the desert and smashed the four corners of the house. It fell upon the young people and they are dead; I alone have escaped to tell you.   Jobs Reaction.    Then Job arose and tore his cloak and cut off his hair. He fell to the ground and worshiped.     He said, Naked I came forth from my mothers womb,   and naked shall I go back there.  The  Lord  gave and the  Lord  has taken away;  blessed be the name of the  Lord !    In all this Job did not sin,   nor did he charge God with wrong.            '
