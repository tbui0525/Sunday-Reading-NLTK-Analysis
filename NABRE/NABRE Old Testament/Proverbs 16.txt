b'   Plans are made in human hearts,  but from the  Lord  comes the tongues response.   All ones ways are pure   in ones own eyes,  but the measurer of motives is the  Lord .   Entrust your works to the  Lord ,  and your plans will succeed.  The  Lord  has made everything for a purpose,  even the wicked for the evil day.   Every proud heart   is an abomination to the  Lord ;   be assured that none will go unpunished.  By steadfast loyalty guilt is expiated,  and by the fear of the  Lord  evil is avoided.   When the  Lord  is pleased with someones ways,  he makes even enemies be at peace with them.  Better a little with justice,  than a large income with injustice.  The human heart plans the way,  but the  Lord  directs the steps.    An oracle is upon the kings lips,  no judgment of his mouth is false.   Balance and scales belong to the  Lord ;  every weight in the sack is his concern.   Wrongdoing is an abomination to kings,  for by justice the throne endures.   The king takes delight in honest lips,  and whoever speaks what is right he loves.   The kings wrath is a messenger of death,   but a wise person can pacify it.  A kings smile means life,  and his favor is like a rain cloud in spring.   How much better to get wisdom than gold!  To get understanding is preferable to silver.    The path of the upright leads away from misfortune;  those who attend to their way guard their lives.   Pride goes before disaster,  and a haughty spirit before a fall.  It is better to be humble with the poor  than to share plunder with the proud.   Whoever ponders a matter will be successful;  happy the one who trusts in the  Lord !  The wise of heart is esteemed for discernment,  and pleasing speech gains a reputation for learning.  Good sense is a fountain of life to those who have it,  but folly is the training of fools.  The heart of the wise makes for eloquent speech,  and increases the learning on their lips.  Pleasing words are a honeycomb,  sweet to the taste and invigorating to the bones.  Sometimes a way seems right,  but the end of it leads to death!   The appetite of workers works for them,  for their mouths urge them on.    Scoundrels are a furnace of evil,  and their lips are like a scorching fire.  Perverse speech sows discord,  and talebearing separates bosom friends.   The violent deceive their neighbors,  and lead them into a way that is not good.  Whoever winks an eye plans perversity;  whoever purses the lips does evil.   Gray hair is a crown of glory;   it is gained by a life that is just.  The patient are better than warriors,  and those who rule their temper, better than the conqueror of a city.   Into the bag the lot is cast,  but from the  Lord  comes every decision.             '
