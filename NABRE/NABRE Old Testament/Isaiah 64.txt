b'   As when brushwood is set ablaze,  or fire makes the water boil! Then your name would be made known to your enemies  and the nations would tremble before you,  While you worked awesome deeds we could not hope for,    such as had not been heard of from of old. No ear has ever heard, no eye ever seen,  any God but you  working such deeds for those who wait for him.   Would that you might meet us doing right,  that we might be mindful of you in our ways! Indeed, you are angry; we have sinned,  we have acted wickedly.  We have all become like something unclean,  all our just deeds are like polluted rags; We have all withered like leaves,  and our crimes carry us away like the wind.   There are none who call upon your name,  none who rouse themselves to take hold of you; For you have hidden your face from us  and have delivered us up to our crimes.   A Final Plea   Yet,  Lord , you are our father;  we are the clay and you our potter:  we are all the work of your hand.  Do not be so very angry,  Lord ,  do not remember our crimes forever;  look upon us, who are all your people!  Your holy cities have become a wilderness;  Zion has become wilderness, Jerusalem desolation!   Our holy and glorious house  in which our ancestors praised you Has been burned with fire;  all that was dear to us is laid waste.  Can you hold back,  Lord , after all this?  Can you remain silent, and afflict us so severely?            '
