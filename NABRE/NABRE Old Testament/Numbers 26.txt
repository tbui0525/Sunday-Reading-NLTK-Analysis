b'   The Second Census.    After the plague     the  Lord  said to Moses and Eleazar, son of Aaron the priest:     Take a census, by ancestral houses, throughout the community of the Israelites of all those of twenty years or more who are eligible for military service in Israel.       So on the plains of Moab along the Jordan at Jericho, Moses and Eleazar the priest enrolled them,     those of twenty years or more, as the  Lord  had commanded Moses. The Israelites who came out of the land of Egypt were as follows:      Reuben, the firstborn of Israel.

Allotment of the Land.       The  Lord  said to Moses:      Among these the land shall be divided as their heritage in keeping with the number of people named.      To a large tribe you shall assign a large heritage, to a small tribe a small heritage, each receiving its heritage in proportion to the number enrolled in it.     But the land shall be divided by lot, all inheriting according to the lists of their ancestral tribes.     As the lot falls the heritage of each tribe, large or small, will be assigned.

To Aaron were born Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar.     But Nadab and Abihu died when they offered unauthorized fire before the  Lord .     The Levites enrolled were twenty-three thousand, every male one month or more of age.   They were not enrolled with the other Israelites, however, for no heritage was given them among the Israelites.    These, then, were those enrolled by Moses and Eleazar the priest, when they enrolled the Israelites on the plains of Moab along the Jordan at Jericho.     Among them there was not one of those who had been enrolled by Moses and Aaron the priest, when they enrolled the Israelites in the wilderness of Sinai.      For the  Lord  had told them that they would surely die in the wilderness, and not one of them was left except Caleb, son of Jephunneh, and Joshua, son of Nun.            '
