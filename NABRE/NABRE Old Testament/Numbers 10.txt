b'  The Silver Trumpets.    The  Lord  said to Moses:     Make two trumpets of silver, making them of hammered silver, for you to use in summoning the community and in breaking camp.     When both are blown, the whole community shall gather round you at the entrance of the tent of meeting;     but when one of them is blown, only the tribal leaders, the heads of the clans of Israel, shall gather round you.     When you sound the signal, those encamped on the east side shall break camp;     when you sound a second signal, those encamped on the south side shall break camp; when you sound a third signal, those encamped on the west side shall break camp; when you sound a fourth signal, those encamped on the north side shall break camp. Thus shall the signal be sounded for them to break camp.     But in calling forth an assembly you are to blow a blast, without sounding the signal.    The sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow the trumpets; this is prescribed forever for you and your descendants.      When in your own land you go to war against an enemy that is attacking you, you shall sound the alarm on the trumpets, and you shall be remembered before the  Lord , your God, and be saved from your foes.     And when you rejoice   on your festivals, and your new-moon feasts, you shall blow the trumpets over your burnt offerings and your communion sacrifices,   so that this serves as a reminder of you before your God. I, the  Lord , am your God.    Departure from Sinai.    In the second year, on the twentieth day of the second month, the cloud rose from the tabernacle of the covenant,     and the Israelites moved on from the wilderness of Sinai by stages, until the cloud came to rest in the wilderness of Paran.    The first time that they broke camp at the direction of the  Lord  through Moses,      the divisional camp of the Judahites, arranged in companies, was the first to set out. Over its whole company was Nahshon, son of Amminadab,     with Nethanel, son of Zuar, over the company of the tribe of Issacharites,     and Eliab, son of Helon, over the company of the tribe of Zebulunites.     Then, after the tabernacle was dismantled, the Gershonites and Merarites who carried the tabernacle set out.     The divisional camp of the Reubenites, arranged in companies, was the next to set out. Over its whole company was Elizur, son of Shedeur,     with Shelumiel, son of Zurishaddai, over the company of the tribe of Simeonites,     and Eliasaph, son of Reuel, over the company of the tribe of Gadites.     The Kohathites, who carried the sacred objects, then set out. Before their arrival the tabernacle would be erected.     The divisional camp of the Ephraimites set out next, arranged in companies. Over its whole company was Elishama, son of Ammihud,     with Gamaliel, son of Pedahzur, over the company of the tribe of Manassites,     and Abidan, son of Gideoni, over the company of the tribe of Benjaminites.     Finally, as rear guard for all the camps, the divisional camp of the Danites set out, arranged in companies. Over its whole company was Ahiezer, son of Ammishaddai,     with Pagiel, son of Ochran, over the company of the tribe of Asherites,     and Ahira, son of Enan, over the company of the tribe of Naphtalites.     This was the order of march for the Israelites, company by company, when they set out.   Hobab as Guide.    Moses said to Hobab,   son of Reuel the Midianite, Moses father-in-law, We are setting out for the place concerning which the  Lord  has said, I will give it to you. Come with us, and we will be generous toward you, for the  Lord  has promised prosperity to Israel.     But he answered, No, I will not come. I am going instead to the land of my birth.     Moses said, Please, do not leave us; you know where we can camp in the wilderness, and you can serve as our guide.     If you come with us, we will share with you the prosperity the  Lord  will bestow on us.   Into the Wilderness.     From the mountain of the  Lord   they made a journey of three days, and the ark of the covenant of the  Lord  went before them for the three-day journey to seek out a resting place for them.     And the cloud of the  Lord  was over them by day when they set out from camp.    Whenever the ark set out, Moses would say, Arise, O  Lord , may your enemies be scattered,  and may those who hate you flee before you.    And when it came to rest, he would say, Bring back, O  Lord , the myriads of Israels troops!            '
