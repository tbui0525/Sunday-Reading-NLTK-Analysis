b' God Appoints the King both King and Priest  A psalm of David. The  Lord  says to my lord:   Sit at my right hand,  while I make your enemies your footstool.   The scepter of your might:  the  Lord  extends your strong scepter from Zion.  Have dominion over your enemies!  Yours is princely power from the day of your birth.  In holy splendor before the daystar,  like dew I begot you.   The  Lord  has sworn and will not waver:  You are a priest forever in the manner of Melchizedek.    At your right hand is the Lord,  who crushes kings on the day of his wrath,   Who judges nations, heaps up corpses,  crushes heads across the wide earth,   Who drinks from the brook by the wayside  and thus holds high his head.
