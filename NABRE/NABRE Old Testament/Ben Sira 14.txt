b'    Happy those whose mouth causes them no grief,  those who are not stung by remorse for sin.   Happy are those whose conscience does not reproach them,  those who have not lost hope.   The Use of Wealth  Wealth is not appropriate for the mean-spirited;   to misers, what use is gold?  What they deny themselves they collect for someone else,  and strangers will live sumptuously on their possessions.   To whom will they be generous that are stingy with themselves  and do not enjoy what is their own?  None are worse than those who are stingy with themselves;  they punish their own avarice.  If ever they do good, it is by mistake;  in the end they reveal their meanness.  Misers are evil people,  they turn away and disregard others.  The greedy see their share as not enough;  greedy injustice dries up the soul.  The eye of the miserly is rapacious for food,  but there is none of it on their own table.     My son, if you have the means, treat yourself well,  and enjoy life as best you can.   Remember that death does not delay,  and you have not been told the graves appointed time.  Before you die, be good to your friends;  give them a share in what you possess.   Do not deprive yourself of good things now  or let a choice portion escape you.  Will you not leave your riches to others,  and your earnings to be divided by lot?  Give and take, treat yourself well,  for in Sheol there are no joys to seek.  All flesh grows old like a garment;  the age-old law is: everyone must die.   As with the leaves growing on a luxuriant tree\xe2\x80\x94  one falls off and another sprouts\xe2\x80\x94 So with the generations of flesh and blood:  one dies and another flourishes.   All human deeds surely perish;  the works they do follow after them.   The Search for Wisdom and Her Blessings   Happy those who meditate on Wisdom,  and fix their gaze on knowledge;   Who ponder her ways in their heart,  and understand her paths;  Who pursue her like a scout,  and watch at her entry way;  Who peep through her windows,  and listen at her doors;  Who encamp near her house  and fasten their tent pegs next to her walls;  Who pitch their tent beside her,  and dwell in a good place;    Who build their nest in her leaves,  and lodge in her branches;  Who take refuge from the heat in her shade  and dwell in her home.
