b'   Better is childlessness with virtue;  for immortal is the memory of virtue,  acknowledged both by God and human beings.   When it is present people imitate it,  and they long for it when it is gone; Forever it marches crowned in triumph,  victorious in unsullied deeds of valor.  But the numerous progeny of the wicked shall be of no avail;  their spurious offshoots shall not strike deep root  nor take firm hold.   For even though their branches flourish for a time,  they are unsteady and shall be rocked by the wind  and, by the violence of the winds, uprooted;   Their twigs shall be broken off untimely,  their fruit useless, unripe for eating,  fit for nothing.  For children born of lawless unions  give evidence of the wickedness of their parents, when they are examined.   C. On Early Death   But the righteous one, though he die early, shall be at rest.   For the age that is honorable comes not with the passing of time,   nor can it be measured in terms of years.  Rather, understanding passes for gray hair,  and an unsullied life is the attainment of old age.

But the people saw and did not understand,  nor did they take that consideration into account.     Yes, the righteous one who has died will condemn  the sinful who live; And youth, swiftly completed, will condemn  the many years of the unrighteous who have grown old.   For they will see the death of the wise one  and will not understand what the  Lord  intended,  or why he kept him safe.  They will see, and hold him in contempt;  but the  Lord  will laugh them to scorn.   And they shall afterward become dishonored corpses   and an unceasing mockery among the dead. For he shall strike them down speechless and prostrate   and rock them to their foundations; They shall be utterly laid waste  and shall be in grief  and their memory shall perish.   The Judgment of the Wicked  Fearful shall they come, at the counting up of their sins,  and their lawless deeds shall convict them to their face.            '
