b'   The Song of Songs,   which is Solomons.   The Woman Speaks of Her Lover  W    Let him kiss me with kisses of his mouth,  for your love is better than wine,    better than the fragrance of your perfumes.  Your name is a flowing perfume\xe2\x80\x94 therefore young women love you.   Draw me after you! Let us run!   The king has brought me to his bed chambers.

My lover   is to me a sachet of myrrh;  between my breasts he lies.  My lover is to me a cluster of henna   from the vineyards of En-gedi.  M   How beautiful you are, my friend,  how beautiful! your eyes are doves!   W  How beautiful you are, my lover\xe2\x80\x94  handsome indeed! Verdant indeed is our couch;    the beams of our house are cedars,  our rafters, cypresses.            '
