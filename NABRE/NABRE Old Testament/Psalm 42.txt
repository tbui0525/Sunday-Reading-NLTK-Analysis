b'  Longing for Gods Presence in the Temple  For the leader. A  maskil  of the Korahites.    I  As the deer longs for streams of water,   so my soul longs for you, O God.  My soul thirsts for God, the living God.  When can I enter and see the face of God?    My tears have been my bread day and night,   as they ask me every day, Where is your God?   Those times I recall  as I pour out my soul,  When I would cross over to the shrine of the Mighty One,   to the house of God, Amid loud cries of thanksgiving,  with the multitude keeping festival.   Why are you downcast, my soul;  why do you groan within me? Wait for God, for I shall again praise him,  my savior and my God.   II  My soul is downcast within me;  therefore I remember you From the land of the Jordan   and Hermon,  from Mount Mizar,    Deep calls to deep  in the roar of your torrents,  and all your waves and breakers  sweep over me.   By day may the  Lord  send his mercy,  and by night may his righteousness be with me!  I will pray   to the God of my life,  I will say to God, my rock:  Why do you forget me?  Why must I go about mourning  with the enemy oppressing me?  It shatters my bones, when my adversaries reproach me,  when they say to me every day: Where is your God?  Why are you downcast, my soul,  why do you groan within me? Wait for God, for I shall again praise him,  my savior and my God.            '
