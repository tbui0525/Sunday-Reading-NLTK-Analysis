b' The Greatness and Goodness of God  Praise. Of David. I will extol you, my God and king;  I will bless your name forever and ever.  Every day I will bless you;  I will praise your name forever and ever.   Great is the  Lord  and worthy of much praise,   whose grandeur is beyond understanding.  One generation praises your deeds to the next  and proclaims your mighty works.   They speak of the splendor of your majestic glory,  tell of your wonderful deeds.   They speak of the power of your awesome acts  and recount your great deeds.   They celebrate your abounding goodness  and joyfully sing of your justice.  The  Lord  is gracious and merciful,  slow to anger and abounding in mercy.   The  Lord  is good to all,  compassionate toward all your works.   All your works give you thanks,  Lord  and your faithful bless you.   They speak of the glory of your reign  and tell of your mighty works,  Making known to the sons of men your mighty acts,  the majestic glory of your rule.  Your reign is a reign for all ages,  your dominion for all generations.  The  Lord  is trustworthy in all his words,  and loving in all his works.  The  Lord  supports all who are falling  and raises up all who are bowed down.   The eyes of all look hopefully to you;  you give them their food in due season.   You open wide your hand  and satisfy the desire of every living thing.  The  Lord  is just in all his ways,  merciful in all his works.   The  Lord  is near to all who call upon him,  to all who call upon him in truth.   He fulfills the desire of those who fear him;  he hears their cry and saves them.   The  Lord  watches over all who love him,  but all the wicked he destroys.   My mouth will speak the praises of the  Lord ;  all flesh will bless his holy name forever and ever.            '
