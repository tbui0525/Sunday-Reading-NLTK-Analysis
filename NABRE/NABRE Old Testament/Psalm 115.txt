b' The Greatness of the True God I  Not to us,  Lord , not to us  but to your name give glory  because of your mercy and faithfulness.   Why should the nations say,  Where is their God?    Our God is in heaven  and does whatever he wills.    II  Their idols are silver and gold,   the work of human hands.   They have mouths but do not speak,  eyes but do not see.  They have ears but do not hear,  noses but do not smell.  They have hands but do not feel,  feet but do not walk;  they produce no sound from their throats.  Their makers will be like them,  and anyone who trusts in them.   III   The house of Israel trusts in the  Lord ,   who is their help and shield.   The house of Aaron trusts in the  Lord ,  who is their help and shield.  Those who fear the  Lord  trust in the  Lord ,  who is their help and shield.  The  Lord  remembers us and will bless us,  will bless the house of Israel,  will bless the house of Aaron,  Will bless those who fear the  Lord ,  small and great alike.  May the  Lord  increase your number,  yours and your descendants.  May you be blessed by the  Lord ,  maker of heaven and earth.   The heavens belong to the  Lord ,  but he has given the earth to the children of Adam.    The dead do not praise the  Lord ,  not all those go down into silence.   It is we who bless the  Lord ,  both now and forever. Hallelujah!            '
