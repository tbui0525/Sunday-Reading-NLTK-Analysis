b' The Ideal Davidic King   But a shoot shall sprout from the stump   of Jesse,  and from his roots a bud shall blossom.    The spirit of the  Lord  shall rest upon him:   a spirit of wisdom and of understanding, A spirit of counsel and of strength,  a spirit of knowledge and of fear of the  Lord ,   and his delight shall be the fear of the  Lord . Not by appearance shall he judge,  nor by hearsay shall he decide,  But he shall judge the poor with justice,  and decide fairly for the lands afflicted.  He shall strike the ruthless with the rod of his mouth,  and with the breath of his lips he shall slay the wicked.   Justice shall be the band around his waist,  and faithfulness a belt upon his hips.    Then the wolf shall be a guest of the lamb,  and the leopard shall lie down with the young goat; The calf and the young lion shall browse together,  with a little child to guide them.   The cow and the bear shall graze,  together their young shall lie down;  the lion shall eat hay like the ox.   The baby shall play by the vipers den,  and the child lay his hand on the adders lair.  They shall not harm or destroy on all my holy mountain;  for the earth shall be filled with knowledge of the  Lord ,  as water covers the sea.   Restoration    On that day, The root of Jesse,  set up as a signal for the peoples\xe2\x80\x94 Him the nations will seek out;  his dwelling shall be glorious.    On that day, The Lord shall again take it in hand  to reclaim the remnant of his people  that is left from Assyria and Egypt, Pathros, Ethiopia, and Elam,  Shinar, Hamath, and the isles of the sea.   He shall raise a signal to the nations   and gather the outcasts of Israel; The dispersed of Judah he shall assemble  from the four corners of the earth.  The envy of Ephraim shall pass away,  and those hostile to Judah shall be cut off; Ephraim shall not envy Judah,  and Judah shall not be hostile to Ephraim;  But they shall swoop down on the foothills  of the Philistines to the west,  together they shall plunder the people of the east;  Edom and Moab shall be their possessions,  and the Ammonites their subjects.  The  Lord  shall dry up the tongue   of the Sea of Egypt,  and wave his hand over the Euphrates with his fierce wind, And divide it into seven streamlets,  so that it can be crossed in sandals.   There shall be a highway for the remnant of his people  that is left from Assyria, As there was for Israel  when it came up from the land of Egypt.             '
