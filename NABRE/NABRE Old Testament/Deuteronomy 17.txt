If the truth of the matter is established that this abomination has been committed in Israel,     you shall bring the man or the woman who has done this evil deed out to your gates   and stone the man or the woman to death.

They shall investigate the case and then announce to you the decision.

When he is sitting upon his royal throne, he shall write a copy of this law   upon a scroll from the one that is in the custody of the levitical priests.
