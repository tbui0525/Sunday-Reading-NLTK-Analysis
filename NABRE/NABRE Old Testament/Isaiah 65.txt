b'    I was ready to respond to those who did not ask,  to be found by those who did not seek me. I said: Here I am! Here I am!  To a nation that did not invoke my name.   I have stretched out my hands all day  to a rebellious people, Who walk in a way that is not good,  following their own designs;   A people who provoke me  continually to my face, Offering sacrifices in gardens  and burning incense on bricks,  Sitting in tombs  and spending the night in caves, Eating the flesh of pigs,  with broth of unclean meat in their dishes;  Crying out, Hold back,  do not come near me, lest I render you holy!  These things are smoke in my nostrils,  a fire that burns all the day.  See, it stands written before me;  I will not remain quiet until I have repaid in full  Your crimes and the crimes of your ancestors as well,  says the  Lord . Since they burned incense on the mountains,  and insulted me on the hills, I will at once pour out in full measure  their recompense into their laps.   Fate of the Just and Unjust in Israel    Thus says the  Lord : As when the juice is pressed from a cluster,  and someone says, Do not destroy it,  for there is still good in it, So will I do for the sake of my servants:  I will not destroy them all.  From Jacob I will bring forth offspring,  from Judah, those who are to possess my mountains; My chosen ones shall possess the land,  my servants shall dwell there.  Sharon shall become a pasture for the flocks,  the Valley of Achor a resting place for the cattle,  for my people who have sought me.   But you who forsake the  Lord ,  who forget my holy mountain, Who spread a table for Fortune  and fill cups of mixed wine for Destiny,   You I will destine for the sword;  you shall all bow down for slaughter; Because I called and you did not answer,  I spoke and you did not listen, But did what is evil in my sight  and things I do not delight in, you chose,    therefore thus says the Lord  God : My servants shall eat,  but you shall go hungry; My servants shall drink,  but you shall be thirsty; My servants shall rejoice,  but you shall be put to shame;  My servants shall shout  for joy of heart, But you shall cry out for grief of heart,  and howl for anguish of spirit.  You will leave your name for a curse to my chosen ones  when the Lord  God  slays you,  and calls his servants by another name.  Whoever invokes a blessing in the land  shall bless by the God of truth;  Whoever takes an oath in the land  shall swear by the God of truth; For the hardships of the past shall be forgotten  and hidden from my eyes.   A World Renewed   See, I am creating new heavens  and a new earth; The former things shall not be remembered  nor come to mind.   Instead, shout for joy and be glad forever  in what I am creating. Indeed, I am creating Jerusalem to be a joy  and its people to be a delight;  I will rejoice in Jerusalem  and exult in my people. No longer shall the sound of weeping be heard there,  or the sound of crying;  No longer shall there be in it  an infant who lives but a few days,  nor anyone who does not live a full lifetime; One who dies at a hundred years shall be considered a youth,  and one who falls short of a hundred shall be thought accursed.   They shall build houses and live in them,  they shall plant vineyards and eat their fruit;  They shall not build and others live there;  they shall not plant and others eat. As the years of a tree, so the years of my people;  and my chosen ones shall long enjoy  the work of their hands.  They shall not toil in vain,  nor beget children for sudden destruction; For they shall be a people blessed by the  Lord  and their descendants with them.  Before they call, I will answer;  while they are yet speaking, I will hear.   The wolf and the lamb shall pasture together,  and the lion shall eat hay like the ox\xe2\x80\x94  but the serpents food shall be dust.  None shall harm or destroy  on all my holy mountain, says the  Lord .            '
