b'  Miscellaneous Proverbs  Against Going Surety for Ones Neighbor   My son, if you have become surety to your neighbor,   given your hand in pledge to another,  You have been snared by the utterance of your lips,  caught by the words of your mouth;  So do this, my son, to free yourself,  since you have fallen into your neighbors power: Go, hurry, rouse your neighbor!  Give no sleep to your eyes,  nor slumber to your eyelids;  Free yourself like a gazelle from the hunter,  or like a bird from the hand of the fowler.   The Ant and the Sluggard at Harvest   Go to the ant,   O sluggard,  study her ways and learn wisdom;  For though she has no chief,  no commander or ruler,  She procures her food in the summer,  stores up her provisions in the harvest.  How long, O sluggard, will you lie there?  when will you rise from your sleep?  A little sleep, a little slumber,  a little folding of the arms to rest\xe2\x80\x94   Then poverty will come upon you like a robber,  and want like a brigand.   The Scoundrel   Scoundrels, villains, are they  who deal in crooked talk.  Shifty of eye,  feet ever moving,  pointing with fingers,  They have perversity in their hearts,  always plotting evil,  sowing discord.  Therefore their doom comes suddenly;  in an instant they are crushed beyond cure.   What the Lord Rejects  There are six things the  Lord  hates,  yes, seven   are an abomination to him;   Haughty eyes, a lying tongue,  hands that shed innocent blood,  A heart that plots wicked schemes,  feet that are quick to run to evil,  The false witness who utters lies,  and the one who sows discord among kindred.   Warning Against Adultery   Observe, my son, your fathers command,  and do not reject your mothers teaching;  Keep them fastened over your heart always,  tie them around your neck.  When you lie down they   will watch over you,  when you wake, they will share your concerns;  wherever you turn, they will guide you.  For the command is a lamp, and the teaching a light,  and a way to life are the reproofs that discipline,  Keeping you from anothers wife,  from the smooth tongue of the foreign woman.   Do not lust in your heart after her beauty,  do not let her captivate you with her glance!   For the price of a harlot  may be scarcely a loaf of bread, But a married woman  is a trap for your precious life.   Can a man take embers into his bosom,  and his garments not be burned?  Or can a man walk on live coals,  and his feet not be scorched?  So with him who sleeps with anothers wife\xe2\x80\x94  none who touches her shall go unpunished.   Thieves are not despised  if out of hunger they steal to satisfy their appetite.  Yet if caught they must pay back sevenfold,  yield up all the wealth of their house.  But those who commit adultery have no sense;  those who do it destroy themselves.   They will be beaten and disgraced,  and their shame will not be wiped away;  For passion enrages the husband,  he will have no pity on the day of vengeance;  He will not consider any restitution,  nor be satisfied by your many bribes.
