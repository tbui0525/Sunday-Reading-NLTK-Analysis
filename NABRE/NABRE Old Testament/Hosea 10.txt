b'  Destruction of Idolatrous Cultic Objects   Israel is a luxuriant vine  whose fruit matches its growth. The more abundant his fruit,  the more altars he built; The more productive his land,  the more sacred pillars   he set up.  Their heart is false!  Now they will pay for their guilt: God will break down their altars  and destroy their sacred pillars.  For now they will say,  We have no king!  Since we do not fear the  Lord ,  the king\xe2\x80\x94what could he do for us?  They make promises,  swear false oaths, and make covenants, While lawsuits sprout  like poisonous weeds   in the furrows of a field!    The inhabitants of Samaria are afraid  for the calf of Beth-aven;  Its people mourn for it  and its idolatrous priests wail over it,  \xe2\x80\x94over its glory which has departed from it.   It too will be carried to Assyria,  as an offering to the great king.   Ephraim will be put to shame,  Israel will be shamed by his schemes.    Samaria and her king will disappear,  like a twig upon the waters.  The high places of Aven   will be destroyed,  the sin of Israel;  thorns and thistles will overgrow their altars. Then they will cry out to the mountains, Cover us!  and to the hills, Fall upon us!    War Because of Israels Wickedness  Since the days of Gibeah   you have sinned, Israel. There they took their stand;  will war not reach them in Gibeah? Against a perverse people   I came and I chastised them; Peoples will be gathered against them  when I bind them to their two crimes.   Ephraim was a trained heifer,  that loved to thresh; I myself laid a yoke  upon her beautiful neck; I will make Ephraim break ground, Judah must plow,  Jacob must harrow for himself:  Sow for yourselves justice,  reap the reward of loyalty; Break up for yourselves a new field,   for it is time to seek the  Lord ,  till he comes and rains justice upon you.   But you have plowed wickedness,  reaped perversity,  and eaten the fruit of falsehood. Because you have trusted in your own power,  and in your many warriors,   The clamor of war shall break out among your people  and all your fortresses shall be ravaged As Salman ravaged Beth-arbel   on the day of war,  smashing mothers along with their children.   So it will be done to you, Bethel,  because of your utter wickedness: At dawn   the king of Israel  will utterly disappear.            '
