b'    Gather, gather yourselves together,  O nation without shame!  Before you are driven away,  like chaff that disappears; Before there comes upon you  the blazing anger of the  Lord ; Before there comes upon you  the day of the  Lord s anger.  Seek the  Lord ,  all you humble of the land,  who have observed his law; Seek justice,  seek humility; Perhaps you will be sheltered  on the day of the  Lord s anger.    Judgment on the Nations  For Gaza shall be forsaken,  and Ashkelon shall be a waste, Ashdod they shall drive out at midday,  and Ekron   shall be uprooted.   Ah! You who dwell by the seacoast,  the nation of Cherethites,   the word of the  Lord  is against you! O Canaan, land of the Philistines,  I will leave you to perish without an inhabitant!  You shall become fields for shepherds,  and folds for flocks.  The seacoast shall belong  to the remnant of the house of Judah;  by the sea they shall pasture. In the houses of Ashkelon  they shall lie down in the evening. For the  Lord  their God will take care of them,  and bring about their restoration.    I have heard the taunts uttered by Moab,  and the insults of the Ammonites,  When they taunted my people  and made boasts against their territory.   Therefore, as I live\xe2\x80\x94  oracle of the  Lord  of hosts\xe2\x80\x94  the God of Israel, Moab shall become like Sodom,  the Ammonites like Gomorrah: A field of weeds,  a salt pit,  a waste forever. The remnant of my people shall plunder them,  the survivors of my nation dispossess them.  This will be the recompense for their pride,  because they taunted and boasted against  the people of the  Lord  of hosts.  The  Lord  shall inspire them with terror  when he makes all the gods of earth waste away; Then the distant shores of the nations,  each from its own place,  shall bow down to him.    You too, O Cushites,   shall be slain by the sword of the  Lord .   He will stretch out his hand against the north,  to destroy Assyria; He will make Nineveh a waste,  dry as the desert.   In her midst flocks shall lie down,  all the wild life of the hollows; The screech owl and the desert owl  shall roost in her columns; The owl shall hoot from the window,  the raven croak from the doorway.   Is this the exultant city   that dwelt secure, That told itself,  I and there is no one else? How it has become a waste,  a lair for wild animals! Those who pass by it  hiss, and shake their fists!            '
