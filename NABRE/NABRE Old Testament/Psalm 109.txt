b' Prayer of a Person Falsely Accused  For the leader. A psalm of David.   I  O God, whom I praise, do not be silent,   for wicked and treacherous mouths attack me. They speak against me with lying tongues;   with hateful words they surround me,  attacking me without cause.  In return for my love they slander me,  even though I prayed for them.  They repay me evil for good,  hatred for my love.    II  Appoint an evil one over him,  an accuser   to stand at his right hand,  That he may be judged and found guilty,  that his plea may be in vain.  May his days be few;  may another take his office.   May his children be fatherless,  his wife, a widow.   May his children wander and beg,  driven from their hovels.  May the usurer snare all he owns,  strangers plunder all he earns.  May no one treat him with mercy  or pity his fatherless children.  May his posterity be destroyed,   their name rooted out in the next generation.  May his fathers guilt be mentioned to the  Lord ;  his mothers sin not rooted out.   May their guilt be always before the  Lord ,   till their memory is banished from the earth,   For he did not remember to show mercy,  but hounded the wretched poor  and brought death to the brokenhearted.  He loved cursing; may it come upon him;  he hated blessing; may none come to him.  May cursing clothe him like a robe;  may it enter his belly like water,  his bones like oil.  May it be near as the clothes he wears,  as the belt always around him.     May this be the reward for my accusers from the  Lord ,  for those speaking evil against me.   III  But you,  Lord , are my Lord,  deal kindly with me for your names sake;  in your great mercy rescue me.  For I am poor and needy;  my heart is pierced within me.  Like a lengthening shadow I am gone,  I am shaken off like the locust.  My knees totter from fasting;   my flesh has wasted away.  I have become a mockery to them;  when they see me, they shake their heads.  Help me,  Lord , my God;  save me in your mercy.  Make them know this is your hand,  that you,  Lord , have done this.  Though they curse, may you bless;  arise, shame them, that your servant may rejoice.  Clothe my accusers with disgrace;  make them wear their shame like a mantle.  I will give fervent thanks to the  Lord ;  before a crowd I will praise him.   For he stands at the right hand of the poor  to save him from those who pass judgment on him.            '
