b'  Jobs Third Reply.     Then Job answered and said:    No doubt you are the people  with whom wisdom shall die!  But I have intelligence as well as you;   I do not fall short of you;  for who does not know such things as these?  I have become the sport of my neighbors:   The one whom God answers when he calls upon him,  The just, the perfect man, is a laughingstock;   The undisturbed esteem my downfall a disgrace  such as awaits unsteady feet;  Yet the tents of robbers are prosperous,  and those who provoke God are secure,  whom God has in his power.   But now ask the beasts to teach you,  the birds of the air to tell you;  Or speak to the earth to instruct you,  and the fish of the sea to inform you.

He loosens the belt of kings,  ties a waistcloth on their loins.   He sends priests away barefoot,  leads the powerful astray.  He silences the trusted adviser,  takes discretion from the elders.  He pours shame on nobles,   the waistband of the strong he loosens.  He uncovers deep things from the darkness,  brings the gloom into the light.  He makes nations great and destroys them,  spreads peoples abroad and abandons them.  He takes understanding from the leaders of the land,  makes them wander in a pathless desert.  They grope in the darkness without light;  he makes them wander like drunkards.            '
