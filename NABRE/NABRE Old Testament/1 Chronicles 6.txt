They served as singers before the tabernacle of the tent of meeting until Solomon built the house of the  Lord  in Jerusalem, and they performed their services according to the order prescribed for them.     Those who so performed are the following, together with their sons.

Their brother Levites were appointed to all the other services of the tabernacle of the house of God.       However, it was Aaron and his sons who made the sacrifice on the altar for burnt offerings and on the altar of incense; they alone had charge of the holy of holies and of making atonement for Israel, as Moses, the servant of God, had commanded.     These were the sons of Aaron: his son Eleazar, whose son was Phinehas, whose son was Abishua,     whose son was Bukki, whose son was Uzzi, whose son was Zerahiah,     whose son was Meraioth, whose son was Amariah, whose son was Ahitub,     whose son was Zadok, whose son was Ahimaaz.

To the sons of Aaron who belonged to the clan of the Kohathites, since the lot fell to them,     was assigned Hebron in the land of Judah, with its adjacent pasture lands.     However, the open country and the villages belonging to the city had been given to Caleb, the son of Jephunneh.

In all, they had thirteen cities with their pasture lands.     The Israelites assigned these cities with their pasture lands to the Levites,     designating them by name and assigning them by lot from the tribes of the Judahites, Simeonites, and Benjaminites.    The other Kohathites obtained ten cities by lot for their clans from the tribe of Ephraim, from the tribe of Dan, and from the half-tribe of Manasseh.     The clans of the Gershonites obtained thirteen cities from the tribes of Issachar, Asher, and Naphtali, and from the half-tribe of Manasseh in Bashan.     The clans of the Merarites obtained twelve cities by lot from the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and Zebulun.    The clans of the Kohathites obtained cities by lot from the tribe of Ephraim.
