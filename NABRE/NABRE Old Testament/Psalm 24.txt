b' The Glory of God in Procession to Zion  A psalm of David. I The earth is the  Lord s and all it holds,   the world and those who dwell in it.  For he founded it on the seas,  established it over the rivers.    II  Who may go up the mountain of the  Lord ?   Who can stand in his holy place?   The clean of hand and pure of heart,  who has not given his soul to useless things,  what is vain.  He will receive blessings from the  Lord ,  and justice from his saving God.  Such is the generation that seeks him,  that seeks the face of the God of Jacob. Selah   III  Lift up your heads, O gates;   be lifted, you ancient portals,  that the king of glory may enter.   Who is this king of glory?  The  Lord , strong and mighty,  the  Lord , mighty in war.  Lift up your heads, O gates;  rise up, you ancient portals,  that the king of glory may enter.  Who is this king of glory?  The  Lord  of hosts, he is the king of glory. Selah            '
