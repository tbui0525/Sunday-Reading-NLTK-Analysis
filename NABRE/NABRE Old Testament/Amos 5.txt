b'  Third Summons   Hear this word which I utter concerning you,  this dirge, house of Israel:  She is fallen, to rise no more,  virgin Israel; She lies abandoned on her land,  with no one to raise her up.   For thus says the Lord  God  to the house of Israel: The city that marched out with a thousand  shall be left with a hundred, Another that marched out with a hundred  shall be left with ten.  For thus says the  Lord   to the house of Israel: Seek me, that you may live,    but do not seek Bethel; Do not come to Gilgal,  and do not cross over to Beer-sheba; For Gilgal shall be led into exile  and Bethel shall be no more.   Seek the  Lord , that you may live,  lest he flare up against the house of Joseph   like a fire  that shall consume the house of Israel, with no one to quench it.    The one who made the Pleiades and Orion,  who turns darkness into dawn,  and darkens day into night; Who summons the waters of the sea,  and pours them out on the surface of the earth;   Who makes destruction fall suddenly upon the stronghold  and brings ruin upon the fortress,  the  Lord  is his name.    First Woe  Woe to those who turn justice into wormwood  and cast righteousness to the ground,  They hate those who reprove at the gate  and abhor those who speak with integrity;  Therefore, because you tax the destitute  and exact from them levies of grain, Though you have built houses of hewn stone,  you shall not live in them; Though you have planted choice vineyards,  you shall not drink their wine.   Yes, I know how many are your crimes,  how grievous your sins: Oppressing the just, accepting bribes,  turning away the needy at the gate.  (Therefore at this time the wise are struck dumb  for it is an evil time.)    Seek good and not evil,  that you may live; Then truly the  Lord , the God of hosts,  will be with you as you claim.  Hate evil and love good,  and let justice prevail at the gate; Then it may be that the  Lord , the God of hosts,  will have pity on the remnant of Joseph.     Therefore, thus says the  Lord ,  the God of hosts, the Lord: In every square there shall be lamentation,  and in every street they shall cry, Oh, no! They shall summon the farmers to wail  and the professional mourners to lament.  And in every vineyard there shall be lamentation  when I pass through your midst, says the  Lord .   Second Woe  Woe to those who yearn  for the day of the  Lord !  What will the day of the  Lord  mean for you?  It will be darkness, not light!   As if someone fled from a lion  and a bear met him; Or as if on entering the house  he rested his hand against the wall,  and a snake bit it.  Truly, the day of the  Lord  will be darkness, not light,  gloom without any brightness!      I hate, I despise your feasts,  I take no pleasure in your solemnities.  Even though you bring me your burnt offerings and grain offerings  I will not accept them; Your stall-fed communion offerings,  I will not look upon them.  Take away from me  your noisy songs; The melodies of your harps,  I will not listen to them.  Rather let justice surge like waters,  and righteousness like an unfailing stream.   Did you bring me sacrifices and grain offerings  for forty years in the desert, O house of Israel?   Yet you will carry away Sukuth,   your king,  and Kaiwan, your star-image,  your gods that you have made for yourselves,   As I exile you beyond Damascus,  says the  Lord ,  whose name is the God of hosts.
