b'  Critique of Advice to Heed Authority   Who is like the wise person,  and who knows the explanation of things? Wisdom illumines the face  and transforms a grim countenance.    Observe the command of the king, in view of your oath to God.     Be not hasty to withdraw from the king; do not persist in an unpleasant situation, for he does whatever he pleases.
