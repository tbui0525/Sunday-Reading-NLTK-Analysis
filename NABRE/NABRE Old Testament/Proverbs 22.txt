b'   A good name is more desirable than great riches,  and high esteem, than gold and silver.    Rich and poor have a common bond:  the  Lord  is the maker of them all.   The astute see an evil and hide,  while the naive continue on and pay the penalty.    The result of humility and fear of the  Lord  is riches, honor and life.   Thorns and snares are on the path of the crooked;  those who would safeguard their lives will avoid them.  Train the young in the way they should go;  even when old, they will not swerve from it.   The rich rule over the poor,  and the borrower is the slave of the lender.   Those who sow iniquity reap calamity,   and the rod used in anger will fail.   The generous will be blessed,  for they share their food with the poor.  Expel the arrogant and discord goes too;  strife and insult cease.  The  Lord  loves the pure of heart;   the person of winning speech has a king for a friend.  The eyes of the  Lord  watch over the knowledgeable,  but he defeats the projects of the faithless.  The sluggard says, A lion is outside;   I might be slain in the street.   The mouth of the foreign woman is a deep pit;   whoever incurs the  Lord s anger will fall into it.  Folly is bound to the heart of a youth,  but the rod of discipline will drive it out.   Oppressing the poor for enrichment,  giving to the rich: both are sheer loss.      The Words of the Wise:  Incline your ear, and hear my words,   and let your mind attend to my teaching;  For it will be well if you hold them within you,  if they all are ready on your lips.  That your trust may be in the  Lord ,  I make them known to you today\xe2\x80\x94yes, to you.  Have I not written for you thirty sayings,  containing counsels and knowledge,  To teach you truly  how to give a dependable report to one who sends you?  Do not rob the poor because they are poor,  nor crush the needy at the gate;   For the  Lord  will defend their cause,   and will plunder those who plunder them.  Do not be friendly with hotheads,  nor associate with the wrathful,  Lest you learn their ways,  and become ensnared.  Do not be one of those who give their hand in pledge,  those who become surety for debts;   For if you are unable to pay,  your bed will be taken from under you.   Do not remove the ancient landmark   that your ancestors set up.   Do you see those skilled at their work?  They will stand in the presence of kings,  but not in the presence of the obscure.            '
