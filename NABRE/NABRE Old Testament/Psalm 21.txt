b' Thanksgiving and Assurances for the King  For the leader. A psalm of David.   I  Lord , the king finds joy in your power;   in your victory how greatly he rejoices!  You have granted him his hearts desire;  you did not refuse the request of his lips. Selah  For you welcomed him with goodly blessings;  you placed on his head a crown of pure gold.  He asked life of you;  you gave it to him,  length of days forever.   Great is his glory in your victory;  majesty and splendor you confer upon him.  You make him the pattern of blessings forever,  you gladden him with the joy of your face.  For the king trusts in the  Lord ,  stands firm through the mercy of the Most High.   II  Your hand will find all your enemies;  your right hand will find your foes!  At the time of your coming  you will make them a fiery furnace. Then the  Lord  in his anger will consume them,  devour them with fire.  Even their descendants you will wipe out from the earth,  their offspring from the human race.  Though they intend evil against you,  devising plots, they will not succeed,  For you will put them to flight;  you will aim at their faces with your bow.   III  Arise,  Lord , in your power!   We will sing and chant the praise of your might.            '
