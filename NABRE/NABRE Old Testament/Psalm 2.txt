b' A Psalm for a Royal Coronation  Why do the nations protest  and the peoples conspire in vain?   Kings on earth rise up  and princes plot together  against the  Lord  and against his anointed one:    Let us break their shackles  and cast off their chains from us!   The one enthroned in heaven laughs;  the Lord derides them,   Then he speaks to them in his anger,  in his wrath he terrifies them:  I myself have installed my king  on Zion, my holy mountain.  I will proclaim the decree of the  Lord ,  he said to me, You are my son;  today I have begotten you.   Ask it of me,  and I will give you the nations as your inheritance,  and, as your possession, the ends of the earth.  With an iron rod you will shepherd them,  like a potters vessel you will shatter them.   And now, kings, give heed;  take warning, judges on earth.  Serve the  Lord  with fear;  exult with trembling, Accept correction  lest he become angry and you perish along the way  when his anger suddenly blazes up.  Blessed are all who take refuge in him!            '
