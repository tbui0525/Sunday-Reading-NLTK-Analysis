b'  The New Zion  Raise a glad cry, you barren one   who never bore a child,  break forth in jubilant song, you who have never been in labor, For more numerous are the children of the deserted wife  than the children of her who has a husband,  says the  Lord .   Enlarge the space for your tent,  spread out your tent cloths unsparingly;  lengthen your ropes and make firm your pegs.   For you shall spread abroad to the right and left;  your descendants shall dispossess the nations  and shall people the deserted cities.      Do not fear, you shall not be put to shame;  do not be discouraged, you shall not be disgraced. For the shame of your youth you shall forget,  the reproach of your widowhood no longer remember.  For your husband is your Maker;  the  Lord  of hosts is his name, Your redeemer,   the Holy One of Israel,  called God of all the earth.    The  Lord  calls you back,  like a wife forsaken and grieved in spirit, A wife married in youth and then cast off,  says your God.   For a brief moment I abandoned you,  but with great tenderness I will take you back.  In an outburst of wrath, for a moment  I hid my face from you; But with enduring love I take pity on you,  says the  Lord , your redeemer.    This is for me like the days of Noah: As I swore then that the waters of Noah  should never again flood the earth, So I have sworn now not to be angry with you,  or to rebuke you.   Though the mountains fall away  and the hills be shaken, My love shall never fall away from you  nor my covenant of peace   be shaken,  says the  Lord , who has mercy on you.     O afflicted one,   storm-battered and unconsoled,  I lay your pavements in carnelians,  your foundations in sapphires;   I will make your battlements of rubies,  your gates of jewels,  and all your walls of precious stones.  All your children shall be taught by the  Lord ;  great shall be the peace of your children.  In justice shall you be established,  far from oppression, you shall not fear,  from destruction, it cannot come near.  If there be an attack, it is not my doing;  whoever attacks shall fall before you.    See, I have created the smith  who blows on the burning coals  and forges weapons as his work; It is I also who have created  the destroyer to work havoc.  Every weapon fashioned against you shall fail;  every tongue that brings you to trial  you shall prove false.   This is the lot of the servants of the  Lord ,  their vindication from me\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the  Lord .            '
