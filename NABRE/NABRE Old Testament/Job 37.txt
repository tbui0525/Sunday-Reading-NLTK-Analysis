b'   At this my heart trembles  and leaps out of its place.  Listen to his angry voice   and the rumble that comes forth from his mouth!  Everywhere under the heavens he sends it,  with his light, to the ends of the earth.  Again his voice roars,  his majestic voice thunders;  he does not restrain them when his voice is heard.  God thunders forth marvels with his voice;  he does great things beyond our knowing.  He says to the snow, Fall to the earth;  likewise to his heavy, drenching rain.  He shuts up all humankind indoors,  so that all people may know his work.  The wild beasts take to cover  and remain quiet in their dens.  Out of its chamber the tempest comes forth;  from the north winds, the cold.  With his breath God brings the frost,  and the broad waters congeal.   The clouds too are laden with moisture,  the storm-cloud scatters its light.

Do you know how the clouds are banked,  the marvels of him who is perfect in knowledge?

Teach us then what we shall say to him;  we cannot, for the darkness, make our plea.  Will he be told about it when I speak?  Can anyone talk when he is being destroyed?  Rather, it is as the light that cannot be seen  while it is obscured by the clouds,  till the wind comes by and sweeps them away.   From Zaphon   the golden splendor comes,  surrounding Gods awesome majesty!  The Almighty! We cannot find him,  preeminent in power and judgment,  abundant in justice, who never oppresses.  Therefore people fear him;  none can see him, however wise their hearts.             '
