b'   False scales are an abomination to the  Lord ,  but an honest weight, his delight.    When pride comes, disgrace comes;  but with the humble is wisdom.   The honesty of the upright guides them;  the faithless are ruined by their duplicity.  Wealth is useless on a day of wrath,    but justice saves from death.  The justice of the honest makes their way straight,  but by their wickedness the wicked fall.    The justice of the upright saves them,  but the faithless are caught in their own intrigue.  When a person dies, hope is destroyed;   expectation pinned on wealth is destroyed.   The just are rescued from a tight spot,  but the wicked fall into it instead.  By a word the impious ruin their neighbors,   but through their knowledge the just are rescued.   When the just prosper, the city rejoices;   when the wicked perish, there is jubilation.  Through the blessing of the upright the city is exalted,  but through the mouth of the wicked it is overthrown.  Whoever reviles a neighbor lacks sense,  but the intelligent keep silent.  One who slanders reveals secrets,   but a trustworthy person keeps a confidence.  For lack of guidance a people falls;  security lies in many counselors.   Harm will come to anyone going surety for another,   but whoever hates giving pledges is secure.   A gracious woman gains esteem,  and ruthless men gain wealth.   Kindly people benefit themselves,  but the merciless harm themselves.  The wicked make empty profits,  but those who sow justice have a sure reward.   Justice leads toward life,  but pursuit of evil, toward death.  The crooked in heart are an abomination to the  Lord ,  but those who walk blamelessly are his delight.   Be assured, the wicked shall not go unpunished,  but the offspring of the just shall escape.  Like a golden ring in a swines snout  is a beautiful woman without judgment.   The desire of the just ends only in good;  the expectation of the wicked is wrath.  One person is lavish yet grows still richer;  another is too sparing, yet is the poorer.   Whoever confers benefits will be amply enriched,  and whoever refreshes others will be refreshed.  Whoever hoards grain, the people curse,  but blessings are on the head of one who distributes it!  Those who seek the good seek favor,  but those who pursue evil will have evil come upon them.   Those who trust in their riches will fall,  but like green leaves the just will flourish.   Those who trouble their household inherit the wind,  and fools become slaves to the wise of heart.  The fruit of justice is a tree of life,  and one who takes lives is a sage.   If the just are recompensed on the earth,  how much more the wicked and the sinner!              '
