b' The Blessed Home of the Just  A song of ascents. I Blessed are all who fear the  Lord ,  and who walk in his ways.   What your hands provide you will enjoy;  you will be blessed and prosper:   Your wife will be like a fruitful vine  within your home, Your children like young olive plants  around your table.   Just so will the man be blessed  who fears the  Lord .   II  May the  Lord  bless you from Zion;  may you see Jerusalems prosperity  all the days of your life,    and live to see your childrens children.  Peace upon Israel!             '
