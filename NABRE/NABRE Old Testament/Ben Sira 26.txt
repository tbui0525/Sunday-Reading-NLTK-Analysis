b'   Happy the husband of a good wife;   the number of his days will be doubled.   A loyal wife brings joy to her husband,  and he will finish his years in peace.  A good wife is a generous gift  bestowed upon him who fears the Lord.   Whether rich or poor, his heart is content,  a smile ever on his face.
