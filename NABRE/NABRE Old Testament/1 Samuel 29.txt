b'  Davids Aid Rejected.    Now the Philistines had mustered all their forces in Aphek, and the Israelites were encamped at the spring in Jezreel.       As the Philistine lords were marching their units of a hundred and a thousand, David and his warriors were marching in the rear guard with Achish.     The Philistine commanders asked, What are those Hebrews doing here? Achish answered them: Why, that is David, the officer of Saul, king of Israel. He has been with me for a year or two, and from the day he came over to me until now I have never found fault in him.       But the Philistine commanders were angered at this and said to him: Send that man back! Let him return to the place you picked out for him.

So David and his warriors left early in the morning to return to the land of the Philistines, and the Philistines went on up to Jezreel.        '
