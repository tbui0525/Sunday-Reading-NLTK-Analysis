b'    Do not be a foe instead of a friend. A bad name, disgrace, and dishonor you will inherit.  Thus the wicked, the double-tongued!    Unruly Passions  Do not fall into the grip of your passion,   lest like fire it consume your strength.  It will eat your leaves and destroy your fruits,  and you will be left like a dry tree.  For fierce passion destroys its owner  and makes him the sport of his enemies.   True Friendship   Pleasant speech multiplies friends,  and gracious lips, friendly greetings.  Let those who are friendly to you be many,  but one in a thousand your confidant.  When you gain friends, gain them through testing,   and do not be quick to trust them.  For there are friends when it suits them,  but they will not be around in time of trouble.  Another is a friend who turns into an enemy,  and tells of the quarrel to your disgrace.  Others are friends, table companions,  but they cannot be found in time of affliction.  When things go well, they are your other self,  and lord it over your servants.  If disaster comes upon you, they turn against you  and hide themselves.  Stay away from your enemies,  and be on guard with your friends.  Faithful friends are a sturdy shelter;  whoever finds one finds a treasure.  Faithful friends are beyond price,  no amount can balance their worth.  Faithful friends are life-saving medicine;  those who fear God will find them.  Those who fear the Lord enjoy stable friendship,  for as they are, so will their neighbors be.   Blessings of Wisdom   My child, from your youth choose discipline;  and when you have gray hair you will find wisdom.  As though plowing and sowing, draw close to her;  then wait for her bountiful crops. For in cultivating her you will work but little,  and soon you will eat her fruit.    She is rough ground to the fool!  The stupid cannot abide her.  She will be like a burdensome stone to them,  and they will not delay in casting her aside.  For discipline   is like her name,  she is not accessible to many.    Listen, my child, and take my advice;  do not refuse my counsel.  Put your feet into her fetters,  and your neck under her yoke.  Bend your shoulders and carry her  and do not be irked at her bonds.    With all your soul draw close to her;  and with all your strength keep her ways.  Inquire and search, seek and find;  when you get hold of her, do not let her go.  Thus at last you will find rest in her,  and she will become your joy.    Her fetters will be a place of strength;  her snare, a robe of spun gold.  Her yoke will be a gold ornament;   her bonds, a purple cord.  You will wear her as a robe of glory,  and bear her as a splendid crown.    If you wish, my son, you can be wise;  if you apply yourself, you can be shrewd.  If you are willing to listen, you can learn;  if you pay attention, you can be instructed.    Stand in the company of the elders;  stay close to whoever is wise.  Be eager to hear every discourse;  let no insightful saying escape you.   If you see the intelligent, seek them out;  let your feet wear away their doorsteps!    Reflect on the law of the Most High,  and let his commandments be your constant study. Then he will enlighten your mind,  and make you wise as you desire.             '
