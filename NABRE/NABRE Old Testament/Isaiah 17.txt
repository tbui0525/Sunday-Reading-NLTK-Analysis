b'  Damascus   Oracle on Damascus:  See, Damascus shall cease to be a city  and become a pile of ruins;   Her cities shall be forever abandoned,  for flocks to lie in undisturbed.  The fortress shall vanish from Ephraim   and dominion from Damascus; The remnant of Aram shall become like the glory  of the Israelites\xe2\x80\x94  oracle of the  Lord  of hosts.   On that day The glory of Jacob shall fade,  and his full body shall grow thin.

Only gleanings shall be left in it,  as when an olive tree has been beaten\xe2\x80\x94 Two or three olives at the very top,  four or five on its most fruitful branches\xe2\x80\x94  oracle of the  Lord , the God of Israel.

But God shall rebuke them,  and they shall flee far away, Driven like chaff on the mountains before a wind,  like tumbleweed before a storm.   At evening, there is terror,  but before morning, they are gone! Such is the portion of those who despoil us,  the lot of those who plunder us.             '
