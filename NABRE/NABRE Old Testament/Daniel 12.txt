b'  The Resurrection  At that time there shall arise Michael,   the great prince,  guardian of your people; It shall be a time unsurpassed in distress  since the nation began until that time. At that time your people shall escape,  everyone who is found written in the book.   Many of those who sleep   in the dust of the earth shall awake; Some to everlasting life,  others to reproach and everlasting disgrace.   But those with insight shall shine brightly  like the splendor of the firmament, And those who lead the many to justice  shall be like the stars   forever.
