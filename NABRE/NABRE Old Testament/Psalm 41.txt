b' Thanksgiving After Sickness  For the leader. A psalm of David.   I  Blessed the one concerned for the poor;   on a day of misfortune, the  Lord  delivers him.   The  Lord  keeps and preserves him,  makes him blessed in the land,  and does not betray him to his enemies.  The  Lord  sustains him on his sickbed,  you turn down his bedding whenever he is ill.    II  Even I have said,  Lord , take note of me;  heal me, although I have sinned against you.  My enemies say bad things against me:  When will he die and his name be forgotten?  When someone comes to visit me, he speaks without sincerity.  His heart stores up malice;  when he leaves, he gossips.   All those who hate me whisper together against me;  they imagine the worst about me:  He has had ruin poured over him;  that one lying down will never rise again.   Even my trusted friend,  who ate my bread,  has raised his heel against me.    III  But you,  Lord , take note of me to raise me up  that I may repay them.     By this I will know you are pleased with me,  that my enemy no longer shouts in triumph over me.  In my integrity may you support me  and let me stand in your presence forever.   Blessed be the  Lord , the God of Israel,  from all eternity and forever.  Amen. Amen.             '
