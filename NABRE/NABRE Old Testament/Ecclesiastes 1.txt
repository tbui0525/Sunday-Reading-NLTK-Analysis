b'   The words of Davids son, Qoheleth, king in Jerusalem:      Vanity of vanities,   says Qoheleth,  vanity of vanities! All things are vanity!    Vanity of Human Toil  What profit have we from all the toil  which we toil at under the sun?    One generation departs and another generation comes,  but the world forever stays.  The sun rises and the sun sets;  then it presses on to the place where it rises.  Shifting south, then north,  back and forth shifts the wind, constantly shifting its course.  All rivers flow to the sea,  yet never does the sea become full. To the place where they flow,  the rivers continue to flow.  All things are wearisome,   too wearisome for words. The eye is not satisfied by seeing  nor has the ear enough of hearing.     What has been, that will be; what has been done, that will be done. Nothing is new under the sun!

Though I said to myself, See, I have greatly increased my wisdom beyond all who were before me in Jerusalem, and my mind has broad experience of wisdom and knowledge,     yet when I applied my mind to know wisdom and knowledge, madness and folly, I learned that this also is a chase after wind.     For in much wisdom there is much sorrow;  whoever increases knowledge increases grief.             '
