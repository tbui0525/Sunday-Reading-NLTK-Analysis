b'  Assembly of Israelites.    So all the Israelites came out as one, from Dan to Beer-sheba    including the land of Gilead, and the assembly gathered to the  Lord  at Mizpah.     The leaders of all the people, all the staff-bearers of Israel,   presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God\xe2\x80\x94four hundred thousand foot soldiers who carried swords.     Meanwhile, the Benjaminites heard that the Israelites had gone up to Mizpah. The Israelites asked, How did this evil thing happen?     and the Levite, the husband of the murdered woman, testified: It was at Gibeah of Benjamin, which my concubine and I had entered for the night.        The lords of Gibeah rose up against me and surrounded me in the house at night. I was the one they intended to kill, but they abused my concubine and she died.      So I took my concubine and cut her up and sent her through every part of the territory of Israel, because of the terrible thing they had done in Israel.     So now, all you Israelites, give your judgment and counsel in this matter.       All the people rose as one to say, None of us will leave for our tents or return to our homes.     Now as for Gibeah, this is what we will do: We will go up against it by lot,     taking from all the tribes of Israel ten men for every hundred, a hundred for every thousand, a thousand for every ten thousand, and procuring supplies for the soldiers who will go to exact from Gibeah of Benjamin the full measure of the terrible thing it committed in Israel.    So all the men of Israel gathered against the city, united as one.     The tribes of Israel sent men throughout the tribe of Benjamin to say, What is this evil that has occurred among you?     Now give up the men, the scoundrels who are in Gibeah, that we may put them to death and thus purge the evil from Israel. But the Benjaminites refused to listen to their kindred, the Israelites.     Instead, the Benjaminites assembled from their cities at Gibeah, to march out to battle with the Israelites.     On that day the Benjaminites mustered from their cities twenty-six thousand swordsmen, in addition to the inhabitants of Gibeah, who mustered seven hundred picked men      who were left-handed, every one of them able to sling a stone at a hair without missing.     The men of Israel, without Benjamin, mustered four hundred thousand swordsmen, all of them warriors.     They went up to Bethel and consulted God. When the Israelites asked, Who shall go up first for us to do battle with the Benjaminites? the  Lord  said: Judah first.         The Israelites rose in the morning and encamped against Gibeah.   War with Benjamin.    The men of Israel marched out to do battle with Benjamin and drew up in battle array against them at Gibeah.     The Benjaminites marched out of Gibeah that day and felled twenty-two thousand men of Israel.      But the army of the men of Israel took courage and again drew up for battle in the place where they had drawn up on the previous day.     Then the Israelites went up and wept before the  Lord  until evening. Shall I again engage my brother Benjamin in battle? they asked the  Lord ; and the  Lord  answered: Attack!     When the Israelites drew near to the Benjaminites on the second day,     Benjamin marched out of Gibeah against them again and felled eighteen thousand Israelites, all of them swordsmen.     So the entire Israelite army went up and entered Bethel, where they sat weeping before the  Lord . They fasted that day until evening and presented burnt offerings and communion offerings before the  Lord .     The Israelites consulted the  Lord  (for the ark of the covenant of the  Lord  was there in those days,     and Phinehas, son of Eleazar, son of Aaron,   was standing in his presence in those days), and asked, Shall I again go out to battle with my brother Benjamin, or shall I stop? The  Lord  said: Attack! For tomorrow I will deliver him into your power.       So Israel set men in ambush around Gibeah.    When the Israelites went up against the Benjaminites on the third day, they drew up against Gibeah as on other occasions.     When the Benjaminites marched out to meet the army, they began, as on other occasions, to strike down some of the troops along the highways, one of which goes up to Bethel and one to Gibeah in the open country; about thirty Israelites were slain.     The Benjaminites thought, They are routed before us as previously. The Israelites, however, were thinking, We will flee and draw them out from the city onto the highways.     And then all the men of Israel rose from their places, forming up at Baal-tamar, and the Israelites in ambush rushed from their place west of Gibeah     and advanced against Gibeah with ten thousand picked men from all Israel. The fighting was severe, but no one knew that a disaster was closing in.     The  Lord  defeated Benjamin before Israel; and on that day the Israelites killed twenty-five thousand one hundred men of Benjamin, all of them swordsmen.    Then the Benjaminites saw that they were defeated. The men of Israel gave ground to Benjamin, trusting in the ambush they had set at Gibeah.     Then the men in ambush, having made a sudden dash against Gibeah, marched in and put the whole city to the sword.     The arrangement the men of Israel had with the men in ambush was that they would send up a smoke signal from the city,     and the men of Israel would then wheel about in the battle. Benjamin, having begun by killing off some thirty of the men of Israel, thought, Surely they are completely routed before us, as in the earlier fighting.     But when the signal, the column of smoke, began to rise up from the city, Benjamin looked back and there was the whole city going up in smoke toward heaven.     Then when the men of Israel wheeled about, the men of Benjamin were thrown into confusion, for they realized that disaster was closing in on them.     They retreated before the men of Israel in the direction of the wilderness, but the fighting kept pace with them, and those who had been in the city were spreading destruction in between.     They surrounded the men of Benjamin, pursued them from Nohah and drove them along to a point east of Gibeah.     Eighteen thousand from Benjamin fell, all of them warriors.     They turned and fled into the wilderness to the crag of Rimmon. The Israelites picked off five thousand men on the highways and kept pace with them as far as Gidom, where they struck down another two thousand of them.     The total of those from Benjamin who fell that day was twenty-five thousand swordsmen, all of them warriors.     Six hundred men turned and fled into the wilderness to the crag of Rimmon, where they remained for four months.     Then the men of Israel turned back against the Benjaminites, putting them to the sword\xe2\x80\x94the inhabitants of the cities, the livestock, and all they came upon.   Moreover they destroyed by fire all the cities they came upon.            '
