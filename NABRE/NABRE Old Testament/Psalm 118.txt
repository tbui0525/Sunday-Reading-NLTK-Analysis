b' Hymn of Thanksgiving I  Give thanks to the  Lord , for he is good,   his mercy endures forever.  Let Israel say:  his mercy endures forever.  Let the house of Aaron say,  his mercy endures forever.  Let those who fear the  Lord  say,   his mercy endures forever.   II  In danger I called on the  Lord ;  the  Lord  answered me and set me free.  The  Lord  is with me; I am not afraid;  what can mortals do against me?   The  Lord  is with me as my helper;  I shall look in triumph on my foes.  Better to take refuge in the  Lord   than to put ones trust in mortals.  Better to take refuge in the  Lord  than to put ones trust in princes.   III  All the nations surrounded me;  in the  Lord s name I cut them off.  They surrounded me on every side;  in the  Lord s name I cut them off.  They surrounded me like bees;   they burned up like fire among thorns;  in the  Lord s name I cut them off.  I was hard pressed and falling,  but the  Lord  came to my help.   The  Lord , my strength and might,  has become my savior.    IV  The joyful shout of deliverance  is heard in the tents of the righteous: The  Lord s right hand works valiantly;   the  Lord s right hand is raised;  the  Lord s right hand works valiantly.  I shall not die but live  and declare the deeds of the  Lord .  The  Lord  chastised me harshly,  but did not hand me over to death.   V  Open the gates of righteousness;  I will enter and thank the  Lord .   This is the  Lord s own gate,  through it the righteous enter.  I thank you for you answered me;  you have been my savior.   The stone the builders rejected  has become the cornerstone.   By the  Lord  has this been done;  it is wonderful in our eyes.  This is the day the  Lord  has made;  let us rejoice in it and be glad.  Lord , grant salvation!   Lord , grant good fortune!   VI  Blessed is he  who comes in the name of the  Lord .  We bless you from the house of the  Lord .   The  Lord  is God and has enlightened us. Join in procession with leafy branches  up to the horns of the altar.   VII  You are my God, I give you thanks;  my God, I offer you praise.  Give thanks to the  Lord , for he is good,  his mercy endures forever.            '
