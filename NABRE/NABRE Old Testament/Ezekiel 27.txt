b'  The Ship Tyre.    The word of the  Lord  came to me:     You, son of man, raise a lament over Tyre,     and say to Tyre, who sits at the entrance to the sea, trader to peoples on many coastlands, Thus says the Lord  God : Tyre, you said, I am a ship,  perfect in beauty;   In the heart of the sea was your territory;  your builders perfected your beauty.   With juniper wood from Senir   they built all your decks; A cedar from Lebanon they took  to make you a mast.  With oaks of Bashan   they fashioned your oars, Your bridge, of ivory-inlaid cypress wood  from the coasts of Kittim.  Fine embroidered linen from Egypt  became your sail; Your awnings were made of purple and scarlet  from the coasts of Elishah.    Inhabitants of Sidon   and Arvad  were your oarsmen; Your own sages, Tyre, were on board,  serving as your sailors.   The elders and sages of Gebal  were with you to caulk your seams. Every ship and sailor on the sea  came to you to carry on trade.   Persia and Lud and Put  were warriors in your army; Shield and helmet they hung on you  to enhance your splendor.  The men of Arvad and Helech   were on your walls all around And Gamadites on your towers;  they hung their shields around your walls,  they made your beauty perfect.  Tarshish traded with you,  so great was your wealth, Exchanging for your wares  silver, iron, tin, and lead.  Javan, Tubal, and Meshech  also traded with you, Exchanging slaves and bronze vessels  for your merchandise.   Horses, steeds, and mules from Beth-togarmah  were exchanged for your wares.  Men of Rhodes trafficked with you;  many coastlands were your agents; Ivory tusks and ebony wood  they brought back as your payment.  Edom traded with you for your many wares:  garnets, purple dye, embroidered cloth, Fine linen, coral, and rubies  they gave you as merchandise.  Judah and the land of Israel  trafficked with you: Minnith wheat, grain,   honey, oil, and balm   they gave you as merchandise.  Damascus traded with you for your many wares,  so great was your wealth,  exchanging Helbon wine and Zahar wool.  Javan exchanged wrought iron, cassia, and aromatic cane  from Uzal for your wares.  Dedan traded with you for riding gear.   Arabia and the sheikhs of Kedar were your agents,  dealing in lambs, rams, and goats.   The merchants of Sheba and Raamah also traded with you,  exchanging for your wares the very best spices,  all kinds of precious stones, and gold.  Haran, Canneh, and Eden,  the merchants of Sheba, Asshur, and Chilmad,  Traded with you, marketing rich garments,  purple cloth, embroidered fabric,  varicolored carpets, and braided cords.  The ships of Tarshish sailed for you with your goods; You were full and heavily laden  in the heart of the sea.  Out into deep waters  your oarsmen brought you; The east wind shattered you  in the heart of the sea.   Your wealth, your goods, your wares,  your sailors, your crew, The caulkers of your seams,  those who traded for your goods, All the warriors with you,  the whole crowd with you Sank into the heart of the sea  on the day of your downfall.   At the sound of your sailors shouts  the waves shudder,   Down from their ships  come all who ply the oars; Sailors, all the seafaring crew,  stand on the shore.  They raise their voices over you  and shout their bitter cries; They pour dust on their heads  and cover themselves with ashes.  For you they shave their heads bald  and put on sackcloth; For you they weep bitterly,  in anguished lament.   They raise a lament for you;  they wail over you: Who was ever destroyed like Tyre  in the midst of the sea?   By exporting your goods by sea  you satisfied many peoples, With your great wealth and merchandise  you enriched the kings of the earth.   Now you are wrecked in the sea,  in the watery depths; Your wares and all your crew  have fallen down with you.  All who dwell on the coastlands  are aghast over you; Their kings are terrified,  their faces distorted.  The traders among the peoples  now hiss at you; You have become a horror,  you shall be no more.            '
