b' VII. Elihus Speeches   Then the three men ceased to answer Job, because in his own eyes he was in the right.        But the anger of Elihu,   son of Barachel the Buzite, of the clan of Ram, was kindled. He was angry with Job for considering himself rather than God to be in the right.      He was angry also with the three friends because they had not found a good answer and had not condemned Job.     But since these men were older than he, Elihu bided his time before addressing Job.     When, however, Elihu saw that there was no reply in the mouths of the three men, his wrath was inflamed.     So Elihu, son of Barachel the Buzite, answered and said: I am young and you are very old;  therefore I held back and was afraid  to declare to you my knowledge.  I thought, days should speak,  and many years teach wisdom!   But there is a spirit in human beings,   the breath of the Almighty, that gives them understanding.  It is not those of many days who are wise,  nor the aged who understand the right.  Therefore I say, listen to me;  I also will declare my knowledge!

Now that they speak no more,  and have ceased to make reply,  I too will speak my part;  I also will declare my knowledge!  For I am full of words;  the spirit within me compels me.  My belly is like unopened wine,  like wineskins ready to burst.  Let me speak and obtain relief;  let me open my lips, and reply.  I would not be partial to anyone,  nor give flattering titles to any.  For I know nothing of flattery;  if I did, my Maker would soon take me away.            '
