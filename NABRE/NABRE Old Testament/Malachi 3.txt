b'  The Messenger of the Covenant   Now I am sending my messenger\xe2\x80\x94  he will prepare the way before me;  And the lord whom you seek will come suddenly to his temple; The messenger of the covenant whom you desire\xe2\x80\x94  see, he is coming! says the  Lord  of hosts.  But who can endure the day of his coming?  Who can stand firm when he appears? For he will be like a refiners fire,  like fullers lye.   He will sit refining and purifying silver,  and he will purify the Levites, Refining them like gold or silver,  that they may bring offerings to the  Lord  in righteousness.  Then the offering of Judah and Jerusalem  will please the  Lord ,  as in ancient days, as in years gone by.  I will draw near to you for judgment,  and I will be swift to bear witness Against sorcerers, adulterers, and perjurers,  those who deprive a laborer of wages, Oppress a widow or an orphan,  or turn aside a resident alien,  without fearing me, says the  Lord  of hosts.   Gifts for God, Blessings for the People  For I, the  Lord , do not change,   and you, sons of Jacob, do not cease to be.   Since the days of your ancestors you have turned aside  from my statutes and have not kept them. Return to me, that I may return to you,  says the  Lord  of hosts. But you say, Why should we return?    Can anyone rob God? But you are robbing me! And you say, How have we robbed you?  Of tithes and contributions!  You are indeed accursed,  for you, the whole nation, rob me.   Bring the whole tithe  into the storehouse,  That there may be food in my house.  Put me to the test, says the  Lord  of hosts, And see if I do not open the floodgates of heaven for you,  and pour down upon you blessing without measure!  I will rebuke the locust for you  so that it will not destroy your crops, And the vine in the field will not be barren,  says the  Lord  of hosts.   All the nations will call you blessed,  for you will be a delightful land,  says the  Lord  of hosts.   The Need to Serve God  Your words are too much for me, says the  Lord .  You ask, What have we spoken against you?   You have said, It is useless to serve God;  what do we gain by observing Gods requirements, And by going about as mourners   before the  Lord  of hosts?  But we call the arrogant blessed;  for evildoers not only prosper  but even test God and escape.   Then those who fear the  Lord  spoke with one another,  and the  Lord  listened attentively; A record book   was written before him  of those who fear the  Lord  and esteem his name.   They shall be mine, says the  Lord  of hosts,  my own special possession, on the day when I take action. And I will have compassion on them,  as a man has compassion on his son who serves him.  Then you will again distinguish  between the just and the wicked, Between the person who serves God,  and the one who does not.   For the day is coming, blazing like an oven,  when all the arrogant and all evildoers will be stubble, And the day that is coming will set them on fire,  leaving them neither root nor branch,  says the  Lord  of hosts.   But for you who fear my name, the sun of justice  will arise with healing in its wings;  And you will go out leaping like calves from the stall   and tread down the wicked; They will become dust under the soles of your feet,  on the day when I take action, says the  Lord  of hosts.   Moses and Elijah   Remember the law of Moses my servant,  whom I charged at Horeb With statutes and ordinances  for all Israel.   Now I am sending to you  Elijah   the prophet, Before the day of the  Lord  comes,  the great and terrible day;  He will turn the heart of fathers to their sons,  and the heart of sons to their fathers, Lest I come and strike  the land with utter destruction.
