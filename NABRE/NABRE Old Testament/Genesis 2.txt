b'   Thus the heavens and the earth and all their array were completed.        On the seventh day God completed the work he had been doing; he rested on the seventh day from all the work he had undertaken.       God blessed the seventh day and made it holy, because on it he rested from all the work he had done in creation.     The Garden of Eden.    This is the story   of the heavens and the earth at their creation. When the  Lord  God made the earth and the heavens\xe2\x80\x94     there was no field shrub on earth and no grass of the field had sprouted, for the  Lord  God had sent no rain upon the earth and there was no man   to till the ground,     but a stream   was welling up out of the earth and watering all the surface of the ground\xe2\x80\x94     then the  Lord  God formed the man   out of the dust of the ground and blew into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living being.     The  Lord  God planted a garden in Eden, in the east,   and placed there the man whom he had formed.        Out of the ground the  Lord  God made grow every tree that was delightful to look at and good for food, with the tree of life in the middle of the garden and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.     A river rises in Eden   to water the garden; beyond there it divides and becomes four branches.     The name of the first is the Pishon; it is the one that winds through the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold.     The gold of that land is good; bdellium and lapis lazuli are also there.     The name of the second river is the Gihon; it is the one that winds all through the land of Cush.       The name of the third river is the Tigris; it is the one that flows east of Asshur. The fourth river is the Euphrates.    The  Lord  God then took the man and settled him in the garden of Eden, to cultivate and care for it.       The  Lord  God gave the man this order: You are free to eat from any of the trees of the garden       except the tree of knowledge of good and evil. From that tree you shall not eat; when you eat from it you shall die.      The  Lord  God said: It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make a helper suited to him.        So the  Lord  God formed out of the ground all the wild animals and all the birds of the air, and he brought them to the man to see what he would call them; whatever the man called each living creature was then its name.     The man gave names to all the tame animals, all the birds of the air, and all the wild animals; but none proved to be a helper suited to the man.    So the  Lord  God cast a deep sleep on the man, and while he was asleep, he took out one of his ribs and closed up its place with flesh.       The  Lord  God then built the rib that he had taken from the man into a woman. When he brought her to the man,     the man said: This one, at last, is bone of my bones  and flesh of my flesh; This one shall be called woman,  for out of man this one has been taken.      That is why a man leaves his father and mother and clings to his wife, and the two of them become one body.     The man and his wife were both naked, yet they felt no shame.             '
