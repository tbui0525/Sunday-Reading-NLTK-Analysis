b'  Ahaziah.     Then the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah, his youngest son, king to succeed him, since all the older sons had been killed by the band that had come into the camp with the Arabians. Thus Ahaziah, son of Jehoram, reigned as the king of Judah.     Ahaziah was twenty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. His mothers name was Athaliah, daughter of Omri.     He, too, walked in the ways of the house of Ahab, because his mother was his counselor in doing evil.     To his own destruction, he did what was evil in the sight of the  Lord , like the house of Ahab, since they were his counselors after the death of his father.    He was also following their counsel when he joined Jehoram, son of Ahab, king of Israel, in battle against Hazael, king of Aram, at Ramoth-gilead, where the Arameans wounded Jehoram.     He returned to Jezreel to be healed of the wounds that had been inflicted on him at Ramah in his battle against Hazael, king of Aram.

But Jehosheba, a daughter of the king, took Joash, Ahaziahs son, and spirited him away from among the kings sons who were about to be slain, and put him and his nurse in a bedroom.
