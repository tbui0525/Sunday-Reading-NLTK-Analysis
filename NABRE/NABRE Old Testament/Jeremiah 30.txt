b'   The Restoration.     This word came to Jeremiah from the  Lord :     Thus says the  Lord , the God of Israel: Write down on a scroll all the words I have spoken to you.       For indeed, the days are coming\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the  Lord \xe2\x80\x94when I will restore the fortunes of my people Israel and Judah\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the  Lord . I will bring them back to the land which I gave to their ancestors, and they shall take possession of it.     These are the words the  Lord  spoke to Israel and to Judah:     Thus says the  Lord : We hear a cry of fear:  terror, not peace.  Inquire and see:  does a male give birth? Why, then, do I see all these men,  their hands on their loins Like women in labor,  all their faces drained of color?   Ah! How mighty is that day\xe2\x80\x94  there is none like it! A time of distress for Jacob,  though he shall be saved from it.     On that day\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the  Lord  of hosts\xe2\x80\x94I will break his yoke off your neck and snap your bonds. Strangers shall no longer enslave them;       instead, they shall serve the  Lord , their God, and David, their king,   whom I will raise up for them.     But you, my servant Jacob, do not fear!\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the  Lord \xe2\x80\x94  do not be dismayed, Israel! For I will soon deliver you from places far away,  your offspring from the land of their exile; Jacob shall again find rest,  secure, with none to frighten him,    for I am with you\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the  Lord \xe2\x80\x94to save you. I will bring to an end all the nations  among whom I have scattered you;  but you I will not bring to an end. I will chastise you as you deserve,  I will not let you go unpunished.    For thus says the  Lord : Incurable is your wound,  grievous your injury;   There is none to plead your case,  no remedy for your running sore,  no healing for you.  All your lovers have forgotten you,  they do not seek you out. I struck you as an enemy would strike,  punishing you cruelly.   Why cry out over your wound?  There is no relief for your pain. Because of your great guilt,  your numerous sins,  I have done this to you.   Yet all who devour you shall be devoured,  all your enemies shall go into exile. All who plunder you shall become plunder,  all who pillage you I will hand over to be pillaged.   For I will restore your health;  I will heal your injuries\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the  Lord . The outcast they have called you,  whom no one looks for.    Thus says the  Lord : See! I will restore the fortunes of Jacobs tents,  on his dwellings I will have compassion; A city shall be rebuilt upon its own ruins,  a citadel restored where it should be.   From them will come praise,  the sound of people rejoicing. I will increase them, they will not decrease,  I will glorify them, they will not be insignificant.   His children shall be as of old,  his assembly shall stand firm in my presence,  I will punish all his oppressors.   His leader   shall be one of his own,  and his ruler shall emerge from his ranks. He shall approach me when I summon him;  Why else would he dare  approach me?\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the  Lord .  You shall be my people,  and I will be your God.   Look! The storm of the  Lord !  His wrath breaks out In a whirling storm  that bursts upon the heads of the wicked.   The anger of the  Lord  will not abate  until he has carried out completely  the decisions of his heart. In days to come  you will fully understand it.             '
