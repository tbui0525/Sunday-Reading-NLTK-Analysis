b' A Prayer in Time of Trouble  A  maskil  of David, when he was in the cave.   A prayer.    With my own voice I cry to the  Lord ;  with my own voice I beseech the  Lord .  Before him I pour out my complaint,  tell of my distress in front of him.  When my spirit is faint within me,   you know my path.  As I go along this path,  they have hidden a trap for me.   I look to my right hand to see   that there is no one willing to acknowledge me. My escape has perished;  no one cares for me.  I cry out to you,  Lord ,  I say, You are my refuge,   my portion in the land of the living.   Listen to my cry for help,  for I am brought very low.  Rescue me from my pursuers,  for they are too strong for me.  Lead my soul from prison,  that I may give thanks to your name. Then the righteous shall gather around me   because you have been good to me.            '
