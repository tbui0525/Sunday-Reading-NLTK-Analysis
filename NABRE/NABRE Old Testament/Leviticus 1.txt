b'   Chapter 1 Burnt Offerings.    The  Lord  called Moses, and spoke to him from the tent of meeting:       Speak to the Israelites and tell them: When any one of you   brings an offering of livestock to the  Lord , you shall bring your offering from the herd or from the flock.       If a persons offering is a burnt offering   from the herd, the offering must be a male without blemish.   The individual shall bring it to the entrance of the tent of meeting to find favor with the  Lord ,     and shall lay a hand   on the head   of the burnt offering, so that it may be acceptable   to make atonement   for the one who offers it.     The bull shall then be slaughtered   before the  Lord , and Aarons sons, the priests, shall offer its blood by splashing it on all the sides of the altar which is at the entrance of the tent of meeting.       Then the burnt offering shall be flayed and cut into pieces.     After Aarons sons, the priests, have put burning embers on the altar and laid wood on them,     they shall lay the pieces of meat, together with the head and the suet, on top of the wood and the embers on the altar;     but the inner organs and the shanks shall be washed with water. The priest shall then burn all of it on the altar as a burnt offering, a sweet-smelling oblation to the  Lord .     If a persons burnt offering is from the flock, that is, a sheep or a goat, the offering must be a male without blemish.     It shall be slaughtered on the north side of the altar before the  Lord , and Aarons sons, the priests, shall splash its blood on all the sides of the altar.     When it has been cut into pieces, the priest shall lay these, together with the head and suet, on top of the wood and the embers on the altar;     but the inner organs and the shanks shall be washed with water. The priest shall then offer all of it, burning it on the altar. It is a burnt offering, a sweet-smelling oblation to the  Lord .    If a person offers a bird as a burnt offering to the  Lord , the offering brought must be a turtledove or a pigeon.       Having brought it to the altar, the priest shall wring its head off and burn it on the altar. The blood shall be drained out against the side of the altar.       He shall remove its crissum   by means of its feathers and throw it on the ash heap at the east side of the altar.     Then, having torn the bird open by its wings without separating the halves, the priest shall burn it on the altar, on the wood and the embers. It is a burnt offering, a sweet-smelling oblation to the  Lord .            '
