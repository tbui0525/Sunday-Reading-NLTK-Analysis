b'  Seventy Years of Exile.    The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim,   son of Josiah, king of Judah (the first year of Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon).       This word the prophet Jeremiah spoke to all the people of Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem:     Since the thirteenth year of Josiah, son of Amon, king of Judah, to this day\xe2\x80\x94that is, twenty-three years\xe2\x80\x94the word of the  Lord  has come to me and I spoke to you untiringly, but you would not listen.       The  Lord  kept sending you all his servants the prophets,   but you refused to listen or pay attention     to this message: Turn back, each of you, from your evil way and from your evil deeds; then you shall remain in the land which the  Lord  gave you and your ancestors, from of old and forever.     Do not follow other gods to serve and bow down to them; do not provoke me with the works of your hands, or I will bring evil upon you.       But you would not listen to me\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the  Lord \xe2\x80\x94and so you provoked me with the works of your hands to your own harm.       Hence, thus says the  Lord  of hosts: Since you would not listen to my words,     I am about to send for and fetch all the tribes from the north\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the  Lord \xe2\x80\x94and I will send for Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, my servant; I will bring them against this land, its inhabitants, and all these neighboring nations. I will doom them, making them an object of horror, of hissing, of everlasting reproach.       Among them I will put to an end the song of joy and the song of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the sound of the millstone and the light of the lamp.     This whole land shall be a ruin and a waste. Seventy years these nations shall serve the king of Babylon;       but when the seventy years have elapsed, I will punish the king of Babylon and that nation and the land of the Chaldeans for their guilt\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the  Lord . Their land I will turn into everlasting waste.       Against that land I will fulfill all the words I have spoken against it, all that is written in this book, which Jeremiah prophesied against all the nations.     They also shall serve many nations and great kings, and thus I will repay them according to their own deeds and according to the works of their hands.    The Cup of Judgment on the Nations.     For thus said the  Lord , the God of Israel, to me: Take this cup of the wine of wrath   from my hand and have all the nations to whom I will send you drink it.       They shall drink, and retch, and go mad, because of the sword I will send among them.       I took the cup from the hand of the  Lord  and gave it as drink to all the nations to whom the  Lord  sent me:     to Jerusalem, the cities of Judah, its kings and princes, to make them a ruin and a waste, an object of hissing and cursing, as they are today;     to Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and his servants, princes, all his people     and those of mixed ancestry; all the kings of the land of Uz;   all the kings of the land of the Philistines: Ashkelon, Gaza, Ekron, and the remnant of Ashdod;     Edom, Moab, and the Ammonites;     all the kings of Tyre, of Sidon, and of the shores beyond the sea;       Dedan and Tema and Buz,   all the desert dwellers who shave their temples;     all the kings of Arabia;     all the kings of Zimri, of Elam, of the Medes;     all the kings of the north, near and far, one after the other; all the kingdoms upon the face of the earth and after them the king of Sheshach   shall drink.    Tell them: Thus says the  Lord  of hosts, the God of Israel: Drink! Get drunk and vomit! Fall, never to rise, before the sword that I will send among you!       If they refuse to take the cup from your hand and drink, say to them: Thus says the  Lord  of hosts: You must drink!       Now that I am inflicting evil on this city, called by my name, how can you possibly escape? You shall not escape! I am calling down the sword upon all the inhabitants of the earth\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the  Lord  of hosts.     As for you, prophesy against them all these words and say to them: The  Lord  roars from on high,  from his holy dwelling he raises his voice; Mightily he roars over his sheepfold,  a shout like that of vintagers echoes   over all the inhabitants of the earth.  The uproar spreads  to the end of the earth; For the  Lord  has an indictment against the nations,  he enters into judgment against all flesh: The wicked shall be given to the sword\xe2\x80\x94  oracle of the  Lord .   Thus says the  Lord  of hosts: Look! disaster stalks  nation after nation; A violent storm surges  from the recesses of the earth.    On that day, those whom the  Lord  has slain will be strewn from one end of the earth to the other. They will not be mourned, they will not be gathered, they will not be buried; they shall lie like dung upon the ground.     Howl, you shepherds, and wail!  roll on the ground, leaders of the flock! The time for your slaughter has come;  like choice rams you shall fall.  There is no flight for the shepherds,  no escape for the leaders of the flock.   Listen! Wailing from the shepherds,  howling from the leaders of the flock! For the  Lord  lays waste their grazing place;   desolate are the peaceful pastures,  from the burning wrath of the  Lord .  Like a lion he leaves his lair,  and their land is made desolate By the sweeping sword,  and the burning wrath of the  Lord .             '
