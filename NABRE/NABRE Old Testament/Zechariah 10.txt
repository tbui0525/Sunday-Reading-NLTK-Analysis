b'  The Lord Strengthens Judah and Rescues Ephraim  Ask the  Lord  for rain in the spring season,   the  Lord  who brings storm clouds, and heavy rains,   who gives to everyone grain in the fields.  For the teraphim   have spoken nonsense,   the diviners have seen false visions; Deceitful dreams they have told,  empty comfort they have offered. This is why they wandered like sheep,  wretched, for they have no shepherd.   My wrath is kindled against the shepherds,   and I will punish the leaders. For the  Lord  of hosts attends to the flock, the house of Judah,  and will make them like a splendid horse in battle.  From them will come the tower,  from them the tent peg,  from them the bow of war,  from them every officer.  Together they will be like warriors,  trampling the mud of the streets in battle. They will wage war because the  Lord  is with them,  and will put the horsemen to shame.  I will strengthen the house of Judah,   the house of Joseph   I will save; I will bring them back, because I have mercy on them;  they will be as if I had never cast them off,  for I am the  Lord  their God, and I will answer them.   Then Ephraim will be like a hero,  and their hearts will be cheered as by wine.  Their children will see and rejoice\xe2\x80\x94  their hearts will exult in the  Lord .  I will whistle for them and gather them in;  for I will redeem them  and they will be as numerous as before.   I sowed them among the nations,  yet in distant lands they will remember me;  they will bear their children and return.   I will bring them back from the land of Egypt,  and gather them from Assyria. To the land of Gilead and to Lebanon I will bring them,  until no room is found for them.  I will cross over to Egypt  and smite the waves of the sea,  and all the depths of the Nile will dry up. The pride of Assyria will be cast down,  and the scepter of Egypt disappear.  I will strengthen them in the  Lord ,   in whose name they will walk\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the  Lord .            '
