b'    The words of Jeremiah, son of Hilkiah, one of the priests from Anathoth,   in the land of Benjamin.     The word of the  Lord  came to him in the days of Josiah, son of Amon, king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his reign,       and again in the days of Jehoiakim, son of Josiah, king of Judah, until the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah, son of Josiah, king of Judah\xe2\x80\x94down to the exile of Jerusalem, in the fifth month.    Call of Jeremiah  The word of the  Lord  came to me:  Before I formed you in the womb I knew you,  before you were born I dedicated you,  a prophet to the nations I appointed you.    Ah, Lord  God ! I said,  I do not know how to speak. I am too young!   But the  Lord  answered me, Do not say, I am too young.  To whomever I send you, you shall go;  whatever I command you, you shall speak.  Do not be afraid of them,  for I am with you to deliver you\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the  Lord .    Then the  Lord  extended his hand and touched my mouth, saying to me, See, I place my words in your mouth!    Today I appoint you  over nations and over kingdoms, To uproot and to tear down,  to destroy and to demolish,  to build and to plant.    The word of the  Lord  came to me: What do you see, Jeremiah? I see a branch of the almond tree,   I replied.     Then the  Lord  said to me: You have seen well, for I am watching over my word to carry it out.      A second time the word of the  Lord  came to me: What do you see? I replied, I see a boiling kettle whose mouth is tipped away from the north.     The  Lord  said to me, And from the north evil will pour out over all who dwell in the land.     Look, I am summoning  all the kingdoms of the north\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the  Lord \xe2\x80\x94 Each king shall come and set up his throne  in the gateways of Jerusalem, Against all its surrounding walls  and against all the cities of Judah.   I will pronounce my sentence against them  for all their wickedness in forsaking me, In burning incense to other gods,  in bowing down to the works of their hands.   But you, prepare yourself;  stand up and tell them  all that I command you. Do not be terrified on account of them,  or I will terrify you before them;  For I am the one who today  makes you a fortified city, A pillar of iron, a wall of bronze,  against the whole land: Against Judahs kings and princes,  its priests and the people of the land.   They will fight against you, but not prevail over you,  for I am with you to deliver you\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the  Lord .            '
