b'   Jacobs Descendants in Egypt.    These are the names of the sons of Israel   who, accompanied by their households, entered into Egypt with Jacob:      Reuben, Simeon, Levi and Judah;     Issachar, Zebulun and Benjamin;     Dan and Naphtali; Gad and Asher.     The total number of Jacobs direct descendants   was seventy.   Joseph was already in Egypt.    Now Joseph and all his brothers and that whole generation died.       But the Israelites were fruitful and prolific. They multiplied and became so very numerous that the land was filled with them.    The Oppression.     Then a new king, who knew nothing of Joseph,   rose to power in Egypt.     He said to his people, See! The Israelite people have multiplied and become more numerous than we are!     Come, let us deal shrewdly with them to stop their increase;   otherwise, in time of war they too may join our enemies to fight against us, and so leave the land.

The midwives, however, feared God; they did not do as the king of Egypt had ordered them, but let the boys live.     So the king of Egypt summoned the midwives and asked them, Why have you done this, allowing the boys to live?     The midwives answered Pharaoh, The Hebrew women are not like the Egyptian women. They are robust and give birth before the midwife arrives.     Therefore God dealt well with the midwives; and the people multiplied and grew very numerous.     And because the midwives feared God, God built up families for them.     Pharaoh then commanded all his people, Throw into the Nile every boy that is born,   but you may let all the girls live.            '
