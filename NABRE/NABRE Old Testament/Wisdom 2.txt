b'    For, not thinking rightly, they said among themselves:  Brief and troubled is our lifetime;   there is no remedy for our dying,  nor is anyone known to have come back from Hades.  For by mere chance were we born,  and hereafter we shall be as though we had not been; Because the breath in our nostrils is smoke,  and reason a spark from the beating of our hearts,  And when this is quenched, our body will be ashes  and our spirit will be poured abroad like empty air.   Even our name will be forgotten in time,  and no one will recall our deeds. So our life will pass away like the traces of a cloud,  and will be dispersed like a mist Pursued by the suns rays  and overpowered by its heat.  For our lifetime is the passing of a shadow;  and our dying cannot be deferred  because it is fixed with a seal; and no one returns.   Come, therefore, let us enjoy the good things that are here,  and make use of creation with youthful zest.   Let us have our fill of costly wine and perfumes,  and let no springtime blossom pass us by;   let us crown ourselves with rosebuds before they wither.  Let no meadow be free from our wantonness;  everywhere let us leave tokens of our merriment,  for this is our portion, and this our lot.   Let us oppress the righteous poor;  let us neither spare the widow  nor revere the aged for hair grown white with time.   But let our strength be our norm of righteousness;  for weakness proves itself useless.     Let us lie in wait for the righteous one, because he is annoying to us;  he opposes our actions, Reproaches us for transgressions of the law   and charges us with violations of our training.   He professes to have knowledge of God  and styles himself a child of the  Lord .   To us he is the censure of our thoughts;  merely to see him is a hardship for us,   Because his life is not like that of others,  and different are his ways.  He judges us debased;  he holds aloof from our paths as from things impure. He calls blest the destiny of the righteous  and boasts that God is his Father.     Let us see whether his words be true;  let us find out what will happen to him in the end.   For if the righteous one is the son of God, God will help him  and deliver him from the hand of his foes.   With violence and torture let us put him to the test  that we may have proof of his gentleness  and try his patience.  Let us condemn him to a shameful death;  for according to his own words, God will take care of him.     These were their thoughts, but they erred;  for their wickedness blinded them,    And they did not know the hidden counsels of God;  neither did they count on a recompense for holiness  nor discern the innocent souls reward.   For God formed us to be imperishable;  the image of his own nature he made us.   But by the envy   of the devil, death entered the world,  and they who are allied with him experience it.
