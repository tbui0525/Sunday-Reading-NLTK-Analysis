b'  Seven Oracles: Judah and Zion Restored.    Then the word of the  Lord  of hosts came:     Thus says the  Lord  of hosts: I am intensely jealous for Zion,   stirred to jealous wrath for her.    Thus says the  Lord : I have returned to Zion,  and I will dwell within Jerusalem; Jerusalem will be called the faithful city,    and the mountain of the  Lord  of hosts, the holy mountain.    Thus says the  Lord  of hosts: Old men and old women will again sit in the streets of Jerusalem, each with staff in hand because of old age.       The city will be filled with boys and girls playing in its streets.    Thus says the  Lord  of hosts: Even if this should seem impossible in the eyes of the remnant of this people in those days, should it seem impossible in my eyes also?  \xe2\x80\x94oracle of the  Lord  of hosts.    Thus says the  Lord  of hosts: I am going to rescue my people from the land of the rising sun, and from the land of the setting sun.     I will bring them back to dwell within Jerusalem. They will be my people, and I will be their God,   in faithfulness and justice.    Thus says the  Lord  of hosts: Let your hands be strong, you who now hear these words which were spoken by the prophets when the foundation of the house of the  Lord  of hosts was laid   for the building of the temple.       For before those days, there were no wages for people, nor hire for animals. Those who came and went were not safe from the enemy, for I set neighbor against neighbor.     But now I will not deal with the remnant of this people as in former days\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the  Lord  of hosts.    For there will be a sowing of peace:  the vine will yield its fruit,  the land will yield its crops,  and the heavens   will yield their dew. I will give all these things to the remnant of this people to possess.     Just as you became a curse among the nations, O house of Judah and house of Israel, so will I save you that you may be a blessing.   Do not fear; let your hands be strong.    Thus says the  Lord  of hosts: Just as I intended to harm you when your ancestors angered me\xe2\x80\x94says the  Lord  of hosts\xe2\x80\x94and I did not relent,     so again in these days I intend to favor Jerusalem and the house of Judah; do not fear!     These then are the things you must do: Speak the truth to one another;   judge with honesty and complete justice in your gates.        Let none of you plot evil against another in your heart, nor love a false oath. For all these things I hate\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the  Lord .   Three Oracles: Judah and the Nations.    The word of the  Lord  of hosts came to me:    Thus says the  Lord  of hosts: The fast days of the fourth, the fifth, the seventh, and the tenth months    will become occasions of joy and gladness, and happy festivals for the house of Judah.   So love faithfulness and peace!    Thus says the  Lord  of hosts: There will yet come peoples and inhabitants of many cities;       and the inhabitants of one city will approach those of another, and say, Come! let us go to implore the favor of the  Lord  and to seek the  Lord  of hosts. I too am going.     Many peoples and strong nations will come to seek the  Lord  of hosts in Jerusalem and to implore the favor of the  Lord .    Thus says the  Lord  of hosts: In those days ten people from nations of every language will take hold,   yes, will take hold of the cloak of every Judahite and say, Let us go with you, for we have heard that God is with you.
