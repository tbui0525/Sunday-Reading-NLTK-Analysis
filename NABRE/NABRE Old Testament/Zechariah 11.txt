b'  The Cry of Trees, Shepherds, and Lions  Open your doors, Lebanon,  that fire may devour your cedars!  Wail, cypress trees,  for the cedars are fallen,  the mighty are destroyed! Wail, oaks of Bashan,  for the dense forest is cut down!  Listen! the wailing of shepherds,  their glory has been destroyed. Listen! the roaring of young lions,  the thickets of the Jordan are destroyed. The Shepherd Narrative.        Thus says the  Lord , my God: Shepherd the flock to be slaughtered.       For they who buy them slay them and are not held accountable; while those who sell them say, Blessed be the  Lord , I have become rich! Even their own shepherds will not pity them.     For I will no longer pity the inhabitants of the earth\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the  Lord .\xe2\x80\x94Yes, I will deliver them into each others power, or into the power of their kings; they will crush the earth, and I will not deliver it out of their power.

And they counted out my wages,   thirty pieces of silver.     Then the  Lord  said to me, Throw it in the treasury\xe2\x80\x94the handsome price at which they valued me. So I took the thirty pieces of silver and threw them into the treasury in the house of the  Lord .     Then I snapped in two my second staff, Union, breaking the kinship between Judah and Israel.    The  Lord  said to me: This time take the gear of a foolish shepherd.       For I am raising up a shepherd in the land who will take no note of those that disappear, nor seek the strays, nor heal the injured,   nor feed the exhausted; but he will eat the flesh of the fat ones and tear off their hoofs!   Oracle to the Worthless Shepherd  Ah! my worthless shepherd  who forsakes the flock!
