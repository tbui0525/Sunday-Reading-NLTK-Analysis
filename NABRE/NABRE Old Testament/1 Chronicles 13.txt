b'  Transfer of the Ark.     After David had taken counsel with his commanders of thousands and of hundreds, that is, with every leader,     he said to the whole assembly of Israel: If it seems good to you, and is so decreed by the  Lord  our God, let us send to the rest of our kindred from all the districts of Israel, and also the priests and the Levites from their cities with pasture lands, that they may join us;       and let us bring the ark of our God here among us, for in the days of Saul we did not consult it.

Therefore he did not take the ark with him into the City of David, but deposited it instead at the house of Obed-edom the Gittite.     The ark of God remained in the house of Obed-edom with his family for three months, and the  Lord  blessed Obed-edoms household and all that he possessed.             '
