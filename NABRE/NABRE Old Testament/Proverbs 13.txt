b'   A wise son loves correction,  but the scoffer heeds no rebuke.   From the fruit of the mouth one enjoys good things,   but from the throat of the treacherous comes violence.   Those who guard their mouths preserve themselves;   those who open wide their lips bring ruin.   The appetite of the sluggard craves but has nothing,  but the appetite of the diligent is amply satisfied.  The just hate deceitful words,  but the wicked are odious and disgraceful.  Justice guards one who walks honestly,  but sin leads the wicked astray.   One acts rich but has nothing;  another acts poor but has great wealth.   Peoples riches serve as ransom for their lives,  but the poor do not even hear a threat.   The light of the just gives joy,  but the lamp   of the wicked goes out.

The tillage of the poor yields abundant food,  but possessions are swept away for lack of justice.   Whoever spares the rod hates the child,  but whoever loves will apply discipline.   When the just eat, their hunger is appeased;  but the belly of the wicked suffers want.            '
