When he saw Queen Esther standing in the courtyard, she won his favor and he extended toward her the golden scepter he held. She came up to him, and touched the top of the scepter.]    Then the king said to her, What is it, Queen Esther? What is your request? Even if it is half of my kingdom, it shall be granted you.
