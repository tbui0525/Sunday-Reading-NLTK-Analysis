b'   At that time\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the  Lord \xe2\x80\x94the bones of the kings and princes of Judah, the bones of the priests and the prophets, and the bones of the inhabitants of Jerusalem will be brought out of their graves       and spread out before the sun, the moon, and the whole host of heaven,   which they loved and served, which they followed, consulted, and worshiped. They will not be gathered up for burial, but will lie like dung upon the ground.       Death will be preferred to life by all the survivors of this wicked people who remain in any of the places to which I banish them\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the  Lord  of hosts.   Israels Conduct Incomprehensible   Tell them: Thus says the  Lord : When someone falls, do they not rise again?  if they turn away, do they not turn back?  Why then do these people resist  with persistent rebellion? Why do they cling to deception,  refuse to turn back?   I have listened closely:  they speak what is not true; No one regrets wickedness,  saying, What have I done? Everyone keeps on running their course,  like a horse dashing into battle.   Even the stork in the sky  knows its seasons; Turtledove, swift, and thrush  observe the time of their return, But my people do not know  the order of the  Lord .   How can you say, We are wise,   we have the law of the  Lord ? See, that has been changed into falsehood  by the lying pen of the scribes!   The wise are put to shame,  terrified, and trapped; Since they have rejected the word of the  Lord ,  what sort of wisdom do they have?    Shameless in Their Crimes  Therefore, I will give their wives to other men,  their fields to new owners. Small and great alike, all are greedy for gain,  prophet and priest, all practice fraud.   They have treated lightly  the injury to the daughter of my people:  Peace, peace! they say,  though there is no peace.   They have acted shamefully; they have done abominable things,  yet they are not at all ashamed,  they do not know how to blush. Hence they shall be among those who fall;  in their time of punishment they shall stumble,  says the  Lord .    Threats of Punishment  I will gather them all in\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the  Lord :  no grapes on the vine, No figs on the fig trees,  foliage withered! Whatever I have given them is gone.  Why do we remain here?  Let us assemble and flee to the fortified cities,  where we will meet our doom; For the  Lord  our God has doomed us,  he has given us poisoned water to drink,  because we have sinned against the  Lord .   We wait for peace to no avail;  for a time of healing, but terror comes instead.   From Dan is heard  the snorting of horses; The neighing of stallions  shakes the whole land. They come to devour the land and everything in it,  the city and its inhabitants.  Yes, I will send against you  poisonous snakes. Against them no charm will work  when they bite you\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the  Lord .    The Prophets Grief over the Peoples Suffering  My joy is gone,  grief is upon me,  my heart is sick.  Listen! the cry of the daughter of my people,  far and wide in the land! Is the  Lord  no longer in Zion,  is her King no longer in her midst? Why do they provoke me with their idols,  with their foreign nonentities?   The harvest is over, the summer ended,  but we have not yet been saved!  I am broken by the injury of the daughter of my people.  I am in mourning; horror has seized me.   Is there no balm in Gilead,   no healer there? Why does new flesh not grow  over the wound of the daughter of my people?   Oh, that my head were a spring of water,  my eyes a fountain of tears, That I might weep day and night  over the slain from the daughter of my people!            '
