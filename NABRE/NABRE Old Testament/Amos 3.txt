b'   First Summons  Hear this word, Israelites, that the  Lord  speaks concerning you,  concerning the whole family I brought up from the land of Egypt:  You alone I have known,   among all the families of the earth;  Therefore I will punish you  for all your iniquities.     Do two journey together  unless they have agreed?  Does a lion roar in the forest  when it has no prey? Does a young lion cry out from its den  unless it has seized something?  Does a bird swoop down on a trap on the ground  when there is no lure for it? Does a snare spring up from the ground  without catching anything?  Does the rams horn sound in a city  without the people becoming frightened? Does disaster befall a city  unless the  Lord  has caused it?     (Indeed, the Lord  God  does nothing without revealing his plan to his servants the prophets.)    The lion has roared,  who would not fear?  The Lord  God  has spoken,  who would not prophesy?    Proclaim this in the strongholds of Assyria,   in the strongholds of the land of Egypt: Gather on the mount of Samaria,  and see the great disorders within it,  the oppressions within its midst.   They do not know how to do what is right\xe2\x80\x94  oracle of the  Lord \xe2\x80\x94 Storing up in their strongholds  violence and destruction.  Therefore thus says the Lord  God : An enemy shall surround the land,  tear down your fortresses,  and pillage your strongholds.  Thus says the  Lord : As the shepherd rescues from the mouth of the lion  a pair of sheeps legs or the tip of an ear, So shall the Israelites escape,  those who dwell in Samaria, With the corner of a couch  or a piece of a cot.     Hear and bear witness against the house of Jacob\xe2\x80\x94  an oracle of the Lord  God , the God of hosts:  On the day when I punish Israel for its crimes,  I will also punish the altars of Bethel; The horns of the altar shall be broken off  and fall to the ground.    I will strike the winter house  and the summer house; The houses of ivory shall lie in ruin,  and their many rooms shall be no more\xe2\x80\x94  oracle of the  Lord .            '
