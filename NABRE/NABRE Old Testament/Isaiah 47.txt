b'  The Fall of Babylon   Come down, sit in the dust,  virgin daughter Babylon; Sit on the ground, dethroned,  daughter of the Chaldeans. No longer shall you be called  dainty and delicate.   Take the millstone and grind flour,  remove your veil; Strip off your skirt, bare your legs,  cross through the streams.  Your nakedness shall be uncovered,  and your shame be seen; I will take vengeance,  I will yield to no entreaty,  says     our redeemer, Whose name is the  Lord  of hosts,  the Holy One of Israel.    Go into darkness and sit in silence,  daughter of the Chaldeans, No longer shall you be called  sovereign mistress of kingdoms.  Angry at my people,  I profaned my heritage And gave them into your power;  but you showed them no mercy; Upon the aged  you laid a very heavy yoke.  You said, I shall remain always,  a sovereign mistress forever! You did not take these things to heart,  but disregarded their outcome.   Now hear this, voluptuous one,  enthroned securely, Saying in your heart,  I, and no one else!  I shall never be a widow,  bereft of my children\xe2\x80\x94   Both these things shall come to you  suddenly, in a single day: Complete bereavement and widowhood  shall come upon you Despite your many sorceries  and the full power of your spells;   Secure in your wickedness,  you said, No one sees me. Your wisdom and your knowledge  led you astray, And you said in your heart,  I, and no one else!  But upon you shall come an evil  you will not be able to charm away; Upon you shall fall a disaster  you cannot ward off. Upon you shall suddenly come  a ruin you cannot imagine.    Keep on with your spells  and your many sorceries,  at which you toiled from your youth. Perhaps you can prevail,  perhaps you can strike terror!  You wore yourself out with so many consultations!  Let the astrologers stand forth to save you, The stargazers who forecast at each new moon  what would happen to you.  See, they are like stubble,  fire consumes them; They cannot deliver themselves  from the spreading flames. This is no warming ember,  no fire to sit before!  Thus do your wizards serve you  with whom you have toiled from your youth; They wander their separate ways,  with none to save you.            '
