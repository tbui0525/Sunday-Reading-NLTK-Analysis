b' Thanksgiving for Deliverance  A psalm. A song for the dedication of the Temple.   Of David.   I  I praise you,  Lord , for you raised me up  and did not let my enemies rejoice over me.  O  Lord , my God,  I cried out to you for help and you healed   me.  Lord , you brought my soul up from Sheol;  you let me live, from going down to the pit.     II  Sing praise to the  Lord , you faithful;  give thanks to his holy memory.  For his anger lasts but a moment;  his favor a lifetime. At dusk weeping comes for the night;  but at dawn there is rejoicing.   III  Complacent,   I once said,  I shall never be shaken.  Lord , you showed me favor,  established for me mountains of virtue. But when you hid your face  I was struck with terror.   To you,  Lord , I cried out;  with the Lord I pleaded for mercy:   What gain is there from my lifeblood,  from my going down to the grave? Does dust give you thanks  or declare your faithfulness?  Hear, O  Lord , have mercy on me;  Lord , be my helper.   IV  You changed my mourning into dancing;  you took off my sackcloth  and clothed me with gladness.   So that my glory may praise you  and not be silent. O  Lord , my God,  forever will I give you thanks.            '
