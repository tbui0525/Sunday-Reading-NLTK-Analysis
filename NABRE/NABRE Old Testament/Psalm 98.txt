b' The Coming of God  A psalm. I Sing a new song to the  Lord ,  for he has done marvelous deeds.  His right hand and holy arm  have won the victory.    The  Lord  has made his victory known;  has revealed his triumph in the sight of the nations,  He has remembered his mercy and faithfulness  toward the house of Israel. All the ends of the earth have seen  the victory of our God.   II  Shout with joy to the  Lord , all the earth;  break into song; sing praise.  Sing praise to the  Lord  with the lyre,  with the lyre and melodious song.  With trumpets and the sound of the horn  shout with joy to the King, the  Lord .    III  Let the sea and what fills it resound,   the world and those who dwell there.  Let the rivers clap their hands,  the mountains shout with them for joy,    Before the  Lord  who comes,  who comes to govern the earth,  To govern the world with justice  and the peoples with fairness.
