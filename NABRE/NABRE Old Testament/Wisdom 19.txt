b'   But merciless wrath assailed the wicked until the end,  for God knew beforehand what they were yet to do:   That though they themselves had agreed to the departure  and had anxiously sent them on their way,  they would regret it and pursue them.   For while they were still engaged in funeral rites  and mourning at the burials of the dead, They adopted another senseless plan:  those whom they had driven out with entreaties  they now pursued as fugitives.   For a compulsion appropriate to this ending drew them on,  and made them forget what had befallen them, That they might complete the torments of their punishment,   and your people might experience a glorious   journey  while those others met an extraordinary death.     For all creation, in its several kinds, was being made over anew,  serving your commands, that your children might be preserved unharmed.   The cloud overshadowed their camp;  and out of what had been water, dry land was seen emerging: Out of the Red Sea an unimpeded road,  and a grassy plain out of the mighty flood.   Over this crossed the whole nation sheltered by your hand,  and they beheld stupendous wonders.  For they ranged about like horses,  and leapt like lambs,  praising you,  Lord , their deliverer.   For they were still mindful of what had happened in their sojourn:  how instead of the young of animals the land brought forth gnats,  and instead of fishes the river swarmed with countless frogs.   And later they saw also a new kind of bird   when, prompted by desire, they asked for pleasant foods;  For to appease them quail came to them from the sea.

For they justly suffered for their own misdeeds,  since they treated their guests with the more grievous   hatred.   For those others   did not receive unfamiliar visitors,   but these were enslaving beneficent guests.  And not that only; but what punishment was to be theirs   since they received strangers unwillingly!  Yet these,   after welcoming them with festivities,  oppressed with awful toils  those who had shared with them the same rights.   And they were struck with blindness,   as those others had been at the doors of the righteous man\xe2\x80\x94 When, surrounded by yawning darkness,  each sought the entrance of his own door.     For the elements, in ever-changing harmony,  like strings of the harp, produce new melody,  while the flow of music steadily persists. And this can be perceived exactly from a review of what took place.  For land creatures were changed into water creatures,  and those that swam went over on land.  Fire in water maintained its own strength,   and water forgot its quenching nature;  Flames, by contrast, neither consumed the flesh  of the perishable animals that went about in them,  nor melted the icelike, quick-melting kind of ambrosial food.  For every way,  Lord ! you magnified and glorified your people;  unfailing, you stood by them in every time and circumstance.             '
