b'   Why are times not set by the Almighty,  and why do his friends not see his days?   People remove landmarks;  they steal herds and pasture them.  The donkeys of orphans they drive away;  they take the widows ox for a pledge.  They force the needy off the road;  all the poor of the land are driven into hiding.  Like wild donkeys in the wilderness,  they go forth to their task of seeking prey;  the steppe provides food for their young;  They harvest fodder in the field,  and glean in the vineyard of the wicked.  They pass the night naked, without clothing;  they have no covering against the cold;  They are drenched with rain from the mountains,  and for want of shelter they cling to the rock.  Orphans are snatched from the breast,  infants of the needy are taken in pledge.   They go about naked, without clothing,  and famished, they carry the sheaves.   Between the rows they press out the oil;  they tread the wine presses, yet are thirsty.  In the city the dying groan,  and the souls of the wounded cry out.  Yet God does not treat it as a disgrace!  They are rebels against the light:   they do not recognize its ways;  they do not stay in its paths.  When there is no light the murderer rises,  to kill the poor and needy;  in the night he acts like a thief.  The eye of the adulterer watches for the twilight;   he says, No eye will see me. He puts a mask over his face;   in the dark he breaks into houses; By day they shut themselves in;  they do not know the light.  Indeed, for all of them morning is deep darkness;  then they recognize the terrors of deep darkness.  He is swift on the surface of the water:   their portion in the land is accursed,  they do not turn aside by way of the vineyards.  Drought and heat snatch away the snow waters,  Sheol, those who have sinned.  May the womb forget him,  may the worm find him sweet,  may he no longer be remembered; And may wickedness be broken like a tree.  May his companion be barren, unable to give birth,  may his widow not prosper!  He   sustains the mighty by his strength,  to him who rises without assurance of his life   he gives safety and support,  and his eyes are on their ways.  They are exalted for a while, and then are no more;  laid low, like everyone else they are gathered up;  like ears of grain they shrivel.  If this be not so, who can make me a liar,  and reduce my words to nothing?            '
