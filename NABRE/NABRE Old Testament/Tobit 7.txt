b'   At the House of Raguel.    When they entered Ecbatana, Tobiah said, Brother Azariah, bring me straight to the house of our kinsman Raguel. So he did, and they came to the house of Raguel, whom they found seated by his courtyard gate. They greeted him first, and he answered, Many greetings to you, brothers! Welcome! You have come in peace! Now enter in peace! And he brought them into his house.     He said to his wife Edna, How this young man resembles Tobit, the son of my uncle!     So Edna asked them, saying, Where are you from, brothers? They answered, We are descendants of Naphtali, now captives in Nineveh.     She said to them, Do you know our kinsman Tobit? They answered her, Indeed, we do know him! She asked, Is he well?     They answered, Yes, he is alive and well. Then Tobiah said, He is my father!     Raguel jumped up, kissed him, and broke into tears.     Then, finding words, he said, A blessing upon you, son! You are the son of a good and noble father. What a terrible misfortune that a man so righteous and charitable has been afflicted with blindness! He embraced his kinsman Tobiah and continued to weep.     His wife Edna also wept for Tobit; and their daughter Sarah also began to weep.   Marriage of Tobiah and Sarah.    Afterward, Raguel slaughtered a ram from the flock and gave them a warm reception. When they had washed, bathed, and reclined to eat and drink, Tobiah said to Raphael, Brother Azariah, ask Raguel to give me my kinswoman Sarah.     Raguel overheard the words; so he said to the young man: Eat and drink and be merry tonight, for no man has a greater right to marry my daughter Sarah than you, brother. Besides, not even I have the right to give her to anyone but you, because you are my closest relative. However, son, I must frankly tell you the truth.     I have given her in marriage to seven husbands who were kinsmen of ours, and all died on the very night they approached her. But now, son, eat and drink. The Lord will look after you both. Tobiah answered, I will neither eat nor drink anything here until you settle what concerns me. Raguel said to him: I will do it. She is yours as decreed by the Book of Moses. It has been decided in heaven that she be given to you! Take your kinswoman; from now on you are her brother, and she is your sister.   She is given to you today and here ever after. May the Lord of heaven prosper you both tonight, son, and grant you mercy and peace.     Then Raguel called his daughter Sarah, and she came to him. He took her by the hand and gave her to Tobiah with these words: Take her according to the law. According to the decree written in the Book of Moses I give her to be your wife. Take her and bring her safely to your father. And may the God of heaven grant both of you a safe journey in peace!       He then called her mother and told her to bring writing materials. He wrote out a copy of a marriage contract stating that he gave Sarah to Tobiah as his wife as decreed by the law of Moses. Her mother brought the material, and he drew up the contract, to which he affixed his seal.     Afterward they began to eat and drink.     Later Raguel called his wife Edna and said, My sister, prepare the other bedroom and bring Sarah there.     She went, made the bed in the room, as he had told her, and brought Sarah there. After she had cried over her, she wiped away her tears and said,     Take courage, my daughter! May the Lord of heaven grant you joy in place of your grief! Courage, my daughter! Then she left.            '
