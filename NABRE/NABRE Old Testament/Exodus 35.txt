Moses assembled the whole Israelite community and said to them,   These are the words the  Lord  has commanded to be observed.     On six days work may be done, but the seventh day shall be holy to you as the sabbath of complete rest to the  Lord . Anyone who does work on that day shall be put to death.     You shall not even light a fire in any of your dwellings on the sabbath day.   Collection of Materials.    Moses said to the whole Israelite community, This is what the  Lord  has commanded:      Receive from among you contributions for the  Lord . Everyone, as his heart prompts him, shall bring, as a contribution to the  Lord , gold, silver, and bronze;     violet, purple, and scarlet yarn; fine linen and goat hair;     rams skins dyed red, and tahash skins; acacia wood;     oil for the light; spices for the anointing oil and for the fragrant incense;     onyx stones and other gems for mounting on the ephod and on the breastpiece.   Call for Artisans.     Let every artisan among you come and make all that the  Lord  has commanded:     the tabernacle, with its tent, its covering, its clasps, its frames, its bars, its columns, and its pedestals;     the ark, with its poles, the cover, and the curtain veil;     the table, with its poles and all its utensils, and the showbread;     the menorah, with its utensils, the lamps, and the oil for the light;     the altar of incense, with its poles; the anointing oil, and the fragrant incense; the entrance curtain for the entrance of the tabernacle;     the altar for burnt offerings, with its bronze grating, its poles, and all its utensils; the basin, with its stand;     the hangings of the court, with their columns and pedestals; the curtain for the gate of the court;     the tent pegs for the tabernacle and for the court, with their ropes;     the service cloths for use in the sanctuary; the sacred vestments for Aaron, the priest, and the vestments for his sons in their ministry.   The Contribution.    When the whole Israelite community left Moses presence,     all, as their hearts moved them and their spirit prompted, brought a contribution to the  Lord  for the work of the tent of meeting, for all its services, and for the sacred vestments.     Both the men and the women, all as their heart prompted them, brought brooches, earrings, rings, necklaces, and various other gold articles.   Everyone who could presented an offering of gold to the  Lord .     Everyone who happened to have violet, purple, or scarlet yarn, fine linen or goat hair, rams skins dyed red or tahash skins, brought them.     Whoever could make a contribution of silver or bronze offered it to the  Lord ; and everyone who happened to have acacia wood for any part of the work, brought it.     All the women who were expert spinners brought hand-spun violet, purple, and scarlet yarn and fine linen thread.     All the women, as their hearts and skills moved them, spun goat hair.     The tribal leaders brought onyx stones and other gems for mounting on the ephod and on the breastpiece;     as well as spices, and oil for the light, anointing oil, and fragrant incense.     Every Israelite man and woman brought to the  Lord  such voluntary offerings as they thought best, for the various kinds of work which the  Lord , through Moses, had commanded to be done.   The Artisans.    Moses said to the Israelites:   See, the  Lord  has singled out Bezalel, son of Uri, son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah,     and has filled him with a divine spirit of skill and understanding and knowledge in every craft:     in the production of embroidery, in making things of gold, silver, or bronze,     in cutting and mounting precious stones, in carving wood, and in every other craft.     He has also given both him and Oholiab, son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, the ability to teach others.     He has endowed them with skill to execute all types of work: engraving, embroidering, the making of variegated cloth of violet, purple, and scarlet yarn and fine linen thread, weaving, and all other arts and crafts.
