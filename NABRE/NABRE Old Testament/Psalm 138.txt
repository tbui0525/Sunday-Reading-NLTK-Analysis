b' Hymn of a Grateful Heart  Of David. I I thank you, Lord, with all my heart;   in the presence of the angels   to you I sing.  I bow low toward your holy temple;  I praise your name for your mercy and faithfulness. For you have exalted over all  your name and your promise.  On the day I cried out, you answered;  you strengthened my spirit.   II  All the kings of earth will praise you,  Lord ,  when they hear the words of your mouth.  They will sing of the ways of the  Lord :  How great is the glory of the  Lord !  The  Lord  is on high, but cares for the lowly   and knows the proud from afar.  Though I walk in the midst of dangers,  you guard my life when my enemies rage. You stretch out your hand;  your right hand saves me.  The  Lord  is with me to the end.  Lord , your mercy endures forever.  Never forsake the work of your hands!            '
