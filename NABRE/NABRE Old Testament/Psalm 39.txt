b' The Vanity of Life  For the leader, for Jeduthun.   A psalm of David.   I  I said, I will watch my ways,  lest I sin with my tongue;  I will keep a muzzle on my mouth.  Mute and silent before the wicked,  I refrain from good things. But my sorrow increases;   my heart smolders within me.  In my sighing a fire blazes up,  and I break into speech:   II  Lord , let me know my end, the number of my days,  that I may learn how frail I am.  To be sure, you establish the expanse of my days;  indeed, my life is as nothing before you.  Every man is but a breath.  Selah   III  Man goes about as a mere phantom;  they hurry about, although in vain;  he heaps up stores without knowing for whom.  And now,  Lord , for what do I wait?  You are my only hope.  From all my sins deliver me;  let me not be the taunt of fools.    I am silent and do not open my mouth  because you are the one who did this.  Take your plague away from me;  I am ravaged by the touch of your hand.  You chastise man with rebukes for sin;  like a moth you consume his treasures.  Every man is but a breath. Selah  Listen to my prayer,  Lord , hear my cry;  do not be deaf to my weeping! For I am with you like a foreigner,  a refugee, like my ancestors.   Turn your gaze from me, that I may smile  before I depart to be no more.            '
