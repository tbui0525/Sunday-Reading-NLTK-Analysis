b'  Collection of Materials.    The  Lord  spoke to Moses:       Speak to the Israelites: Let them receive contributions for me. From each you shall receive the contribution that their hearts prompt them to give me.     These are the contributions you shall accept from them: gold, silver, and bronze;       violet, purple, and scarlet yarn; fine linen and goat hair;     rams skins dyed red, and tahash   skins; acacia wood;     oil for the light; spices for the anointing oil and for the fragrant incense;     onyx stones and other gems for mounting on the ephod and the breastpiece.     They are to make a sanctuary for me, that I may dwell in their midst.       According to all that I show you regarding the pattern of the tabernacle and the pattern of its furnishings, so you are to make it.    Plan of the Ark.    You shall make an ark of acacia wood,   two and a half cubits   long, one and a half cubits wide, and one and a half cubits high.     Plate it inside and outside with pure gold, and put a molding of gold around the top of it.     Cast four gold rings and put them on the four supports of the ark, two rings on one side and two on the opposite side.     Then make poles of acacia wood and plate them with gold.     These poles you are to put through the rings on the sides of the ark, for carrying it;     they must remain in the rings of the ark and never be withdrawn.     In the ark you are to put the covenant which I will give you.    You shall then make a cover   of pure gold, two and a half cubits long, and one and a half cubits wide.     Make two cherubim   of beaten gold for the two ends of the cover;     make one cherub at one end, and the other at the other end, of one piece with the cover, at each end.     The cherubim shall have their wings spread out above, sheltering the cover with them; they shall face each other, with their faces looking toward the cover.     This cover you shall then place on top of the ark. In the ark itself you are to put the covenant which I will give you.     There I will meet you and there, from above the cover, between the two cherubim on the ark of the covenant, I will tell you all that I command you regarding the Israelites.   The Table.    You shall also make a table of acacia   wood, two cubits long, a cubit wide, and a cubit and a half high.     Plate it with pure gold and make a molding of gold around it.     Make a frame   for it, a handbreadth high, and make a molding of gold around the frame.     You shall also make four rings of gold for it and fasten them at the four corners, one at each leg.     The rings shall be alongside the frame as holders for the poles to carry the table.     These poles for carrying the table you shall make of acacia wood and plate with gold.     You shall make its plates   and cups, as well as its pitchers and bowls for pouring libations; make them of pure gold.     On the table you shall always keep showbread set before me.    The Menorah.    You shall make a menorah   of pure beaten gold  \xe2\x80\x94its shaft and branches\xe2\x80\x94with its cups and knobs and petals springing directly from it.     Six branches are to extend from its sides, three branches on one side, and three on the other.      On one branch there are to be three cups, shaped like almond blossoms, each with its knob and petals; on the opposite branch there are to be three cups, shaped like almond blossoms, each with its knob and petals; and so for the six branches that extend from the menorah.     On the menorah there are to be four cups,   shaped like almond blossoms, with their knobs and petals.     The six branches that go out from the menorah are to have a knob under each pair.     Their knobs and branches shall so spring from it that the whole will form a single piece of pure beaten gold.      You shall then make seven lamps   for it and so set up the lamps that they give their light on the space in front of the menorah.     These, as well as the trimming shears and trays,   must be of pure gold.     Use a talent   of pure gold for the menorah and all these utensils.     See that you make them according to the pattern shown you on the mountain.             '
