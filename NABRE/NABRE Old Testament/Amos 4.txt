b'  Second Summons  Hear this word, you cows of Bashan,   who live on the mount of Samaria: Who oppress the destitute  and abuse the needy; Who say to your husbands,  Bring us a drink!  The Lord  God  has sworn by his holiness: Truly days are coming upon you  when they shall drag you away with ropes,  your children with fishhooks;  You shall go out through the breached walls  one in front of the other, And you shall be exiled to Harmon\xe2\x80\x94   oracle of the  Lord .    Come to Bethel   and sin,  to Gilgal and sin all the more! Each morning bring your sacrifices,  every third day your tithes;  Burn leavened bread as a thanksgiving sacrifice,  proclaim publicly your voluntary offerings, For so you love to do, Israelites\xe2\x80\x94  oracle of the Lord  God .    Though I made your teeth  clean of food in all your cities,  and made bread scarce in all your dwellings, Yet you did not return to me\xe2\x80\x94  oracle of the  Lord .    And I withheld the rain from you  when the harvest was still three months away; I sent rain upon one city  but not upon another; One field was watered by rain,  but the one I did not water dried up;  Two or three cities staggered to another to drink water  but were not satisfied; Yet you did not return to me\xe2\x80\x94  oracle of the  Lord .  I struck you with blight and mildew;  locusts devoured your gardens and vineyards,  the caterpillar consumed your fig trees and olive trees; Yet you did not return to me\xe2\x80\x94  oracle of the  Lord .   I sent upon you pestilence like that of Egypt;   with the sword I killed your young men and your captured horses,  and to your nostrils I brought the stench of your camps; Yet you did not return to me\xe2\x80\x94  oracle of the  Lord .  I overthrew you  as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah;  you were like a brand plucked from the fire,  Yet you did not return to me\xe2\x80\x94  oracle of the  Lord .  Therefore thus I will do to you,   Israel:  and since I will deal thus with you,  prepare to meet your God, O Israel!  The one who forms mountains and creates winds,  and declares to mortals their thoughts; Who makes dawn into darkness  and strides upon the heights of the earth,  the  Lord , the God of hosts, is his name!
