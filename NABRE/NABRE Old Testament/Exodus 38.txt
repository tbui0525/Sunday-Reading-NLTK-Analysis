b'  The Altar for Burnt Offerings.    The altar for burnt offerings   was made of acacia wood, on a square, five cubits long and five cubits wide; its height was three cubits.     At the four corners horns were made that sprang directly from the altar. It was then plated with bronze.     All the utensils of the altar, the pots, shovels, basins, forks and fire pans, were likewise made of bronze.     A grating, a bronze network, was made for the altar and placed around it, on the ground, half as high as the altar itself.     Four rings were cast for the four corners of the bronze grating, as holders for the poles,     which were made of acacia wood and plated with bronze.     The poles were put through the rings on the sides of the altar for carrying it. The altar was made in the form of a hollow box.    The bronze basin,   with its bronze stand, was made from the mirrors of the women who served   at the entrance of the tent of meeting.   The Court of the Tabernacle.     The court was made as follows. On the south side the hangings of the court were of fine linen twined, a hundred cubits long,     with twenty columns and twenty pedestals of bronze, the hooks and bands of the columns being of silver.     On the north side there were similar hangings, a hundred cubits long, with twenty columns and twenty pedestals of bronze; the hooks and bands of the columns were of silver.     On the west side there were hangings, fifty cubits long, with ten columns and ten pedestals; the hooks and bands of the columns were of silver.     On the east side the court was fifty cubits.     On one side there were hangings to the extent of fifteen cubits, with three columns and three pedestals;     on the other side, beyond the gate of the court, there were likewise hangings to the extent of fifteen cubits, with three columns and three pedestals.     The hangings on all sides of the court were woven of fine linen twined.     The pedestals of the columns were of bronze, while the hooks and bands of the columns were of silver; the capitals were silver-plated, and all the columns of the court were banded with silver.    At the gate of the court there was a variegated curtain, woven of violet, purple, and scarlet yarn and of fine linen twined, twenty cubits long and five cubits wide, in keeping with the hangings of the court.     There were four columns and four pedestals of bronze for it, while their hooks were of silver, and their capitals and their bands silver-plated.     All the tent pegs for the tabernacle and for the court around it were of bronze.   Amount of Metal Used.    The following is an account of the various amounts used on the tabernacle, the tabernacle of the covenant, drawn up at the command of Moses by the Levites under the direction of Ithamar, son of Aaron the priest.     However, it was Bezalel, son of Uri,   son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, who made all that the  Lord  commanded Moses,     and he was assisted by Oholiab, son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, who was an engraver, an embroiderer, and a weaver of variegated cloth of violet, purple, and scarlet yarn and of fine linen.    All the gold used in the entire construction of the sanctuary, having previously been given as an offering, amounted to twenty-nine talents and seven hundred and thirty shekels, according to the standard of the sanctuary shekel.     The silver of those of the community who were enrolled was one hundred talents and one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five shekels, according to the standard of the sanctuary shekel;     one bekah apiece, that is, a half-shekel, according to the standard of the sanctuary shekel, was received from everyone who was enrolled, of twenty years or more, namely, six hundred and three thousand five hundred and fifty men.       One hundred talents of silver were used for casting the pedestals of the sanctuary and the pedestals of the veil, one talent for each pedestal, or one hundred talents for the one hundred pedestals.     The remaining one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five shekels were used for making the hooks on the columns, for plating the capitals, and for banding them with silver.     The bronze, given as an offering, amounted to seventy talents and two thousand four hundred shekels.     With this were made the pedestals at the entrance of the tent of meeting, the bronze altar with its bronze gratings, and all the utensils of the altar,     the pedestals around the court, the pedestals at the gate of the court, and all the tent pegs for the tabernacle and for the court around it.
