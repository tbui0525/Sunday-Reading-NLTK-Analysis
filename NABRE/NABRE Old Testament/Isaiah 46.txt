b'  The Gods of Babylon  Bel bows down, Nebo   stoops,  their idols set upon beasts and cattle; They must be borne upon shoulders,  a load for weary animals.  They stoop and bow down together;  unable to deliver those who bear them,  they too go into captivity.    Hear me, O house of Jacob,  all the remnant of the house of Israel, My burden from the womb,  whom I have carried since birth.   Even to your old age I am he,  even when your hair is gray I will carry you; I have done this, and I will lift you up,  I will carry you to safety.    To whom would you liken me as an equal,  compare me, as though we were alike?  There are those who pour out gold from a purse  and weigh out silver on the scales; They hire a goldsmith to make it into a god  before which they bow down in worship.  They lift it to their shoulders to carry;  when they set it down, it stays,  and does not move from the place. They cry out to it, but it cannot answer;  it delivers no one from distress.    Remember this and be firm,  take it to heart, you rebels;   remember the former things, those long ago: I am God, there is no other;  I am God, there is none like me.  At the beginning I declare the outcome;  from of old, things not yet done. I say that my plan shall stand,  I accomplish my every desire.    I summon from the east a bird of prey,   from a distant land, one to carry out my plan. Yes, I have spoken, I will accomplish it;  I have planned it, and I will do it.  Listen to me, you fainthearted,  far from the victory of justice:  I am bringing on that victory, it is not far off,  my salvation shall not tarry; I will put salvation within Zion,  give to Israel my glory.
