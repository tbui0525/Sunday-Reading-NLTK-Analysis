b'   No evil can harm the one who fears the  Lord ;  through trials, again and again he is rescued.   Whoever hates the law is without wisdom,  and is tossed about like a boat in a storm.  The prudent trust in the word of the  Lord ,  and the law is dependable for them as a divine oracle.   Prepare your words and then you will be listened to;  draw upon your training, and give your answer.    Like the wheel of a cart is the mind of a fool,  and his thoughts like a turning axle.  A mocking friend is like a stallion  that neighs, no matter who the rider may be.     Why is one day more important than another,  when the same sun lights up every day of the year?  By the  Lord s knowledge they are kept distinct;  and he designates the seasons and feasts.   Some he exalts and sanctifies,  and others he lists as ordinary days.   Likewise, all people are of clay,  and from earth humankind was formed;   In the fullness of his knowledge the Lord distinguished them,  and he designated their different ways.  Some he blessed and exalted,  and some he sanctified and drew to himself. Others he cursed and brought low,  and expelled them from their place.  Like clay in the hands of a potter,  to be molded according to his pleasure, So are people in the hands of their Maker,  to be dealt with as he decides.   As evil contrasts with good, and death with life,  so are sinners in contrast with the godly.   See now all the works of the Most High:  they come in pairs, one the opposite of the other.

Make a slave work, and he will look for rest;  let his hands be idle and he will seek to be free.   The yoke and harness will bow the neck;  and for a wicked slave, punishment in the stocks.  Force him to work that he be not idle,   for idleness teaches much mischief.  Put him to work, as is fitting for him;  and if he does not obey, load him with chains. But never lord it over any human being,  and do nothing unjust.
