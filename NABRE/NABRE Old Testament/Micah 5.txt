b'    But you, Bethlehem-Ephrathah   least among the clans of Judah, From you shall come forth for me  one who is to be ruler in Israel; Whose origin is from of old,  from ancient times.  Therefore the Lord will give them up, until the time  when she who is to give birth has borne,  Then the rest of his kindred shall return  to the children of Israel.   He shall take his place as shepherd  by the strength of the  Lord ,  by the majestic name of the  Lord , his God; And they shall dwell securely, for now his greatness  shall reach to the ends of the earth:   he shall be peace.  If Assyria invades our country  and treads upon our land, We shall raise against it seven shepherds,  eight of royal standing;  They shall tend the land of Assyria with the sword,  and the land of Nimrod   with the drawn sword; They will deliver us from Assyria,  when it invades our land,  when it treads upon our borders.    The remnant of Jacob shall be  in the midst of many peoples, Like dew coming from the  Lord ,  like showers on the grass, Which wait for no one,  delay for no human being.  And the remnant of Jacob shall be among the nations,  in the midst of many peoples, Like a lion among beasts of the forest,  like a young lion among flocks of sheep; When it passes through it tramples;  it tears and no one can rescue.  Your hand shall be lifted above your foes,  and all your enemies shall be cut down.      On that day\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the  Lord \xe2\x80\x94 I will destroy the horses from your midst  and ruin your chariots;  I will destroy the cities of your land  and tear down all your fortresses.  I will destroy the sorcery you practice,  and there shall no longer be soothsayers among you.  I will destroy your carved figures  and the sacred stones   from your midst; And you shall no longer worship  the works of your hands.   I will tear out the asherahs from your midst,  and destroy your cities.  I will wreak vengeance in anger and wrath  upon the nations that have not listened.            '
