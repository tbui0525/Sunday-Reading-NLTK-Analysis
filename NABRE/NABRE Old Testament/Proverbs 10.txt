b'   The Proverbs of Solomon: A wise son gives his father joy,  but a foolish son is a grief to his mother.    Ill-gotten treasures profit nothing,  but justice saves from death.    The  Lord  does not let the just go hungry,  but the craving of the wicked he thwarts.   The slack hand impoverishes,  but the busy hand brings riches.   A son who gathers in summer is a credit;  a son who slumbers during harvest, a disgrace.  Blessings are for the head of the just;  but the mouth of the wicked conceals violence.   The memory of the just serves as blessing,  but the name of the wicked will rot.   A wise heart accepts commands,  but a babbling fool will be overthrown.   Whoever walks honestly walks securely,  but one whose ways are crooked will fare badly.  One who winks at a fault causes trouble,  but one who frankly reproves promotes peace.  The mouth of the just is a fountain of life,  but the mouth of the wicked conceals violence.  Hatred stirs up disputes,    but love covers all offenses.   On the lips of the intelligent is found wisdom,  but a rod for the back of one without sense.   The wise store up knowledge,  but the mouth of a fool is imminent ruin.  The wealth of the rich is their strong city;  the ruin of the poor is their poverty.   The labor of the just leads to life,  the gains of the wicked, to futility.    Whoever follows instruction is in the path to life,  but whoever disregards reproof goes astray.   Whoever conceals hatred has lying lips,  and whoever spreads slander is a fool.  Where words are many, sin is not wanting;  but those who restrain their lips do well.   Choice silver is the tongue of the just;  the heart of the wicked is of little worth.  The lips of the just nourish many,  but fools die for want of sense.   It is the  Lord s blessing that brings wealth,   and no effort can substitute for it.   Crime is the entertainment of the fool;  but wisdom is for the person of understanding.  What the wicked fear will befall them,  but the desire of the just will be granted.  When the tempest passes, the wicked are no more;  but the just are established forever.  As vinegar to the teeth, and smoke to the eyes,  are sluggards to those who send them.  Fear of the  Lord  prolongs life,  but the years of the wicked are cut short.   The hope of the just brings joy,  but the expectation of the wicked perishes.   The  Lord  is a stronghold to those who walk honestly,  downfall for evildoers.  The just will never be disturbed,  but the wicked will not abide in the land.  The mouth of the just yields wisdom,  but the perverse tongue will be cut off.  The lips of the just know favor,  but the mouth of the wicked, perversion.             '
