b'  Exhortation to Seek Wisdom   Hear, therefore, kings, and understand;   learn, you magistrates   of the earths expanse!  Give ear, you who have power over multitudes  and lord it over throngs of peoples!  Because authority was given you by the Lord  and sovereignty by the Most High,  who shall probe your works and scrutinize your counsels!   Because, though you were ministers of his kingdom, you did not judge rightly,  and did not keep the law,   nor walk according to the will of God,  Terribly and swiftly he shall come against you,  because severe judgment awaits the exalted\xe2\x80\x94  For the lowly may be pardoned out of mercy   but the mighty shall be mightily put to the test.  For the Ruler of all shows no partiality,  nor does he fear greatness,  Because he himself made the great as well as the small,  and provides for all alike;   but for those in power a rigorous scrutiny impends.    To you, therefore, O princes, are my words addressed   that you may learn wisdom and that you may not fall away.  For those who keep the holy precepts hallowed will be found holy,  and those learned in them will have ready a response.   Desire therefore my words;  long for them and you will be instructed.    Resplendent and unfading is Wisdom,  and she is readily perceived by those who love her,  and found by those who seek her.   She hastens to make herself known to those who desire her;    one who watches for her at dawn will not be disappointed,  for she will be found sitting at the gate.  For setting your heart on her is the perfection of prudence,  and whoever keeps vigil for her is quickly free from care;  Because she makes her rounds, seeking those worthy of her,  and graciously appears to them on the way,  and goes to meet them with full attention.      For the first step toward Wisdom is an earnest desire for discipline;    then, care for discipline is love of her;  love means the keeping of her laws; To observe her laws is the basis for incorruptibility;   and incorruptibility makes one close to God;   thus the desire for Wisdom leads to a kingdom.  If, then, you find pleasure in throne and scepter, you princes of peoples,  honor Wisdom, that you may reign as kings forever.   Introduction  Now what wisdom is, and how she came to be I shall proclaim;  and I shall conceal no secrets from you, But from the very beginning I shall search out  and bring to light knowledge of her;  I shall not diverge from the truth.   Neither shall I admit consuming jealousy to my company,  because that can have no fellowship with Wisdom.   A multitude of the wise is the safety of the world,  and a prudent king, the stability of the people;    so take instruction from my words, to your profit.            '
