b'  Reign of Hoshea of Israel.    In the twelfth year of Ahaz, king of Judah, Hoshea, son of Elah, became king in Samaria over Israel for nine years.    He did what was evil in the  Lord s sight, yet not to the extent of the kings of Israel before him.     Shalmaneser,   king of Assyria, advanced against him, and Hoshea became his vassal and paid him tribute.       But the king of Assyria found Hoshea guilty of conspiracy for sending messengers to the king of Egypt at Sais, and for failure to pay the annual tribute to the king of Assyria. So the king of Assyria arrested and imprisoned him.     Then the king of Assyria   occupied the whole land and attacked Samaria, which he besieged for three years.   Israelites Deported.    In Hosheas ninth year, the king of Assyria took Samaria, deported the Israelites to Assyria, and settled them in Halah, and at the Habor, a river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes.       This came about because the Israelites sinned against the  Lord , their God, who had brought them up from the land of Egypt, from under the hand of Pharaoh, king of Egypt. They venerated other gods,      they followed the rites of the nations whom the  Lord  had dispossessed before the Israelites and those that the kings of Israel had practiced.     They adopted unlawful practices toward the  Lord , their God. They built high places in all their cities, from guard post to garrisoned town.     They set up pillars and asherahs   for themselves on every high hill and under every green tree.     They burned incense there, on all the high places, like the nations whom the  Lord  had sent into exile at their coming. They did evil things that provoked the  Lord ,     and served idols, although the  Lord  had told them: You must not do this.     The  Lord  warned Israel and Judah by every prophet and seer: Give up your evil ways and keep my commandments and statutes, in accordance with the entire law which I enjoined on your ancestors and which I sent you by my servants the prophets.     But they did not listen. They grew as stiff-necked as their ancestors, who had not believed in the  Lord , their God.       They rejected his statutes, the covenant he had made with their ancestors, and the warnings he had given them. They followed emptiness and became empty; they followed the surrounding nations whom the  Lord  had commanded them not to imitate.       They abandoned all the commandments of the  Lord , their God: they made for themselves two molten calves; they made an asherah; they bowed down to all the host of heaven; they served Baal.        They immolated their sons and daughters by fire. They practiced augury and divination. They surrendered themselves to doing what was evil in the  Lord s sight, and provoked him.     The  Lord  became enraged, and removed them from his presence. Only the tribe of Judah was left.     Even the people of Judah did not keep the commandments of the  Lord , their God, but followed the rites practiced by Israel.     So the  Lord  rejected the entire people of Israel: he afflicted them and delivered them over to plunderers, finally casting them from his presence.       When he tore Israel away from the house of David, they made Jeroboam, son of Nebat, king; but Jeroboam lured the Israelites away from the  Lord , causing them to commit a great sin.       The Israelites imitated Jeroboam in all the sins he committed; they would not depart from them.    Finally, the  Lord  removed Israel from his presence, just as he had declared through all his servants, the prophets. Thus Israel went into exile from their native soil to Assyria until this very day.   Foreigners Deported to Israel.    The king of Assyria brought people from Babylon, Cuthah, Avva, Hamath, and Sepharvaim, and settled them in the cities of Samaria in place of the Israelites. They took possession of Samaria and dwelt in its cities.     When they first settled there, they did not venerate the  Lord , so he sent lions among them that killed some of them.     A report reached the king of Assyria: The nations you deported and settled in the cities of Samaria do not know the proper worship of the god of the land, so he has sent lions among them that are killing them, since they do not know the law of the god of the land.     The king of Assyria gave the order, Send back some of the priests you deported, to go there and settle, to teach them the proper worship of the god of the land.     So one of the priests who had been deported from Samaria returned and settled in Bethel, and began to teach them how to venerate the  Lord .    Thus each of these nations continued to make its own gods, setting them up in the shrines of the high places the Samarians had made: each nation in the cities in which they dwelt.     The Babylonians made Sukkot-Benot;   the people of Cuth made Nergal; those from Hamath made Ashima;     those from Avva made Nibhaz and Tartak; and those from Sepharvaim immolated their children by fire to their city gods, King Hadad and King Anu.     At the same time, they were venerating the  Lord , appointing from their own number priests for the high places to officiate for them in the shrines on the high places.     They were both venerating the  Lord  and serving their own gods. They followed the custom of the nations from among whom they had been deported.    To this very day they continue to act according to their former customs, not venerating the  Lord  nor observing the statutes and regulations, the law and commandment, that the  Lord  enjoined on the descendants of Jacob, whom he had named Israel.       When the  Lord  made a covenant with them, he commanded them: You must not venerate other gods, nor bow down to them, nor serve them, nor offer sacrifice to them,       but only to the  Lord , who brought you up from the land of Egypt with great power and outstretched arm. Him shall you venerate, to him shall you bow down, and to him shall you offer sacrifice.     You must be careful always to observe the statutes and ordinances, the law and commandment, which he wrote for you; you must not venerate other gods.     The covenant I made with you, you must not forget; you must not venerate other gods.     You must venerate only the  Lord , your God; it is he who will deliver you from the power of all your enemies.     But they did not listen; they continued to act according to their former customs.    But these nations were both venerating the  Lord  and serving their own idols. Their children and childrens children are still acting like their ancestors, to this very day.            '
