b' God of the Universe I  Sing to the  Lord  a new song;   sing to the  Lord , all the earth.  Sing to the  Lord , bless his name;  proclaim his salvation day after day.  Tell his glory among the nations;  among all peoples, his marvelous deeds.    II   For great is the  Lord  and highly to be praised,  to be feared above all gods.   For the gods of the nations are idols,  but the  Lord  made the heavens.   Splendor and power go before him;  power and grandeur are in his holy place.   III  Give to the  Lord , you families of nations,  give to the  Lord  glory and might;   give to the  Lord  the glory due his name!  Bring gifts and enter his courts;   bow down to the  Lord , splendid in holiness. Tremble before him, all the earth;    declare among the nations: The  Lord  is king. The world will surely stand fast, never to be shaken.  He rules the peoples with fairness.   IV  Let the heavens be glad and the earth rejoice;  let the sea and what fills it resound;    let the plains be joyful and all that is in them. Then let all the trees of the forest rejoice   before the  Lord  who comes,  who comes to govern the earth,  To govern the world with justice  and the peoples with faithfulness.            '
