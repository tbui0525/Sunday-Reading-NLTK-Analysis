b' The Ruler of All the Nations  For the leader. A psalm of the Korahites.   I  All you peoples, clap your hands;  shout to God with joyful cries.   For the  Lord , the Most High, is to be feared,  the great king over all the earth,   Who made people subject to us,  nations under our feet,    Who chose our heritage for us,  the glory of Jacob, whom he loves.  Selah   II   God has gone up with a shout;  the  Lord , amid trumpet blasts.   Sing praise to God, sing praise;  sing praise to our king, sing praise.   III  For God is king over all the earth;   sing hymns of praise.  God rules over the nations;  God sits upon his holy throne.  The princes of the peoples assemble  with the people of the God of Abraham. For the shields of the earth belong to God,  highly exalted.             '
