b'  Against Edom.     The word of the  Lord  came to me:     Son of man, set your face against Mount Seir and prophesy against it.     Say to it: Thus says the Lord  God : Watch out! I am against you, Mount Seir. I will stretch out my hand against you and turn you into a desolate waste.       Your cities I will turn into ruins, and you shall be a desolation; then you shall know that I am the  Lord .     Because you nursed a long-standing hatred and handed the Israelites over to the sword at the time of their collapse, at the time of their final punishment,        therefore, as I live\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the Lord  God \xe2\x80\x94you are guilty of blood, and blood, I swear, shall pursue you.     I will make Mount Seir a desolate waste and cut off from it anyone who travels across it and back.       I will fill its mountains with the slain; those slain by the sword shall fall on your hills, into your valleys and all your ravines.    I will make you a desolation forever,  your cities will not be inhabited,  and you shall know that I am the  Lord .     Because you said: The two nations and the two lands   belong to me; let us take possession of them\xe2\x80\x94although the  Lord  was there\xe2\x80\x94     therefore, as I live\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the Lord  God \xe2\x80\x94I will deal with you according to the anger and envy you dealt out to them in your hatred, and I will make myself known to them when I execute judgment on you,       then you shall know that I am the  Lord . I have heard all the insults you spoke against the mountains of Israel, saying: They are desolate; they have been given to us to devour.     You boasted against me with your mouths and used insolent words against me. I heard everything!     Thus says the Lord  God : Because you rejoiced that the whole land was desolate, so I will do to you.     As you rejoiced over the devastation of the heritage of the house of Israel, the same I will do to you: you will become a ruin, Mount Seir, and the whole of Edom, all of it! Then they shall know that I am the  Lord .             '
