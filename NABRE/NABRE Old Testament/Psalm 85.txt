b' Prayer for Divine Favor  For the leader. A psalm of the Korahites.   I  You once favored,  Lord , your land,  restored the captives of Jacob.   You forgave the guilt of your people,  pardoned all their sins. Selah  You withdrew all your wrath,  turned back from your burning anger.    II  Restore us, God of our salvation;  let go of your displeasure with us.   Will you be angry with us forever,  prolong your anger for all generations?   Certainly you will again restore our life,  that your people may rejoice in you.  Show us,  Lord , your mercy;  grant us your salvation.   III   I will listen for what God, the  Lord , has to say;  surely he will speak of peace To his people and to his faithful.  May they not turn to foolishness!  Near indeed is his salvation for those who fear him;  glory will dwell in our land.   Love and truth will meet;  justice and peace will kiss.   Truth will spring from the earth;  justice will look down from heaven.   Yes, the  Lord  will grant his bounty;  our land will yield its produce.   Justice will march before him,  and make a way for his footsteps.            '
