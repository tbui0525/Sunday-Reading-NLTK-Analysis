b' Prayer of Innocence  Of David. I Judge me,  Lord !  For I have walked in my integrity.  In the  Lord  I trust;  I do not falter.  Examine me, Lord, and test me;  search my heart and mind.   Your mercy is before my eyes;  I walk guided by your faithfulness.    II  I do not sit with worthless men,  nor with hypocrites do I mingle.  I hate an evil assembly;  with the wicked I do not sit.  I will wash my hands   in innocence   so that I may process around your altar, Lord,  To hear the sound of thanksgiving,  and recount all your wondrous deeds.  Lord, I love the refuge of your house,  the site of the dwelling-place of your glory.    III  Do not take me away with sinners,  nor my life with the men of blood,   In whose hands there is a plot,  their right hands full of bribery.  But I walk in my integrity;   redeem me, be gracious to me!   My foot stands on level ground;   in assemblies I will bless the  Lord .             '
