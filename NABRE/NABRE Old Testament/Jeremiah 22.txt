b'   Thus says the  Lord : Go down to the palace of the king of Judah and there deliver this word:     You shall say: Listen to the word of the  Lord , king of Judah, who sit on the throne of David, you, your ministers, and your people who enter by these gates!       Thus says the  Lord : Do what is right and just. Rescue the victims from the hand of their oppressors. Do not wrong or oppress the resident alien, the orphan, or the widow, and do not shed innocent blood in this place.       If you carry out these commands, kings who succeed to the throne of David will continue to enter the gates of this house, riding in chariots or mounted on horses, with their ministers, and their people.     But if you do not obey these commands, I swear by myself\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the  Lord : this house shall become rubble.     For thus says the  Lord  concerning the house of the king of Judah: Though you be to me like Gilead,  like the peak of Lebanon, I swear I shall turn you into a waste,  with cities uninhabited.  Against you I will send destroyers,  each with their tools: They shall cut down your choice cedars,  and cast them into the fire.     Many nations will pass by this city and ask one another: Why has the  Lord  done this to so great a city?       And they will be told: Because they have deserted their covenant with the  Lord , their God, by worshiping and serving other gods.    Jehoahaz  Do not weep for him who is dead,   nor mourn for him! Weep rather for him who is going away;  never again to see  the land of his birth.     Thus says the  Lord  concerning Shallum,   son of Josiah, king of Judah, his fathers successor, who left this place: He shall never return,     but in the place where they exiled him, there he shall die; he shall never see this land again.   Jehoiakim  Woe to him who builds his house on wrongdoing,  his roof-chambers on injustice; Who works his neighbors without pay,   and gives them no wages.   Who says, I will build myself a spacious house,  with airy rooms, Who cuts out windows for it,  panels it with cedar,  and paints it with vermilion.  Must you prove your rank among kings   by competing with them in cedar? Did not your father eat and drink,  And act justly and righteously?  Then he prospered.   Because he dispensed justice to the weak and the poor,  he prospered. Is this not to know me?\xe2\x80\x94  oracle of the  Lord .   But your eyes and heart are set on nothing  except your own gain, On shedding innocent blood  and practicing oppression and extortion.     Therefore, thus says the  Lord  concerning Jehoiakim, son of Josiah, king of Judah: They shall not lament him,  Alas! my brother; Alas! sister.  They shall not lament him,  Alas, Lord! alas, Majesty!   The burial of a donkey   he shall be given,  dragged forth and cast out  beyond the gates of Jerusalem.    Jeconiah  Climb Lebanon and cry out,   in Bashan lift up your voice; Cry out from Abarim,  for all your lovers are crushed.   I spoke to you when you were secure,  but you answered, I will not listen. This has been your way from your youth,  not to listen to my voice.  The wind shall shepherd all your shepherds,  your lovers shall go into exile. Surely then you shall be ashamed and confounded  because of all your wickedness.  You who dwell on Lebanon,  who nest in the cedars, How you shall groan when pains come upon you,  like the pangs of a woman in childbirth!    As I live\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the  Lord \xe2\x80\x94even if you, Coniah,   son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, were a signet ring   on my right hand, I would snatch you off.     I will hand you over to those who seek your life, to those you dread: Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, and the Chaldeans.       I will cast you out, you and the mother who bore you,   into a land different from the land of your birth; and there you will die;       Neither shall return to the land for which they yearn.     Is this man Coniah a thing despised, to be broken,  a vessel that no one wants? Why are he and his offspring cast out?  why thrown into a land they do not know?  O land, land, land,  hear the word of the  Lord \xe2\x80\x94   Thus says the  Lord :   Write this man down as childless,   a man who will never prosper in his life! Nor shall any of his descendants prosper,  to sit upon the throne of David,  to rule again over Judah.            '
