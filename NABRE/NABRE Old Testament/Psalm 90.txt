b'  Gods Eternity and Human Frailty  A prayer of Moses, the man of God. I Lord, you have been our refuge  through all generations.  Before the mountains were born,  the earth and the world brought forth,  from eternity to eternity you are God.   You turn humanity back into dust,   saying, Return, you children of Adam!   A thousand years in your eyes  are merely a day gone by,  Before a watch passes in the night,    you wash them away;  They sleep,  and in the morning they sprout again like an herb.  In the morning it blooms only to pass away;  in the evening it is wilted and withered.     II  Truly we are consumed by your anger,  filled with terror by your wrath.  You have kept our faults before you,  our hidden sins in the light of your face.   Our life ebbs away under your wrath;   our years end like a sigh.  Seventy is the sum of our years,  or eighty, if we are strong; Most of them are toil and sorrow;  they pass quickly, and we are gone.  Who comprehends the strength of your anger?  Your wrath matches the fear it inspires.  Teach us to count our days aright,  that we may gain wisdom of heart.   III  Relent, O  Lord ! How long?  Have pity on your servants!  Fill us at daybreak with your mercy,   that all our days we may sing for joy.  Make us glad as many days as you humbled us,  for as many years as we have seen trouble.   Show your deeds to your servants,  your glory to their children.  May the favor of the Lord our God be ours.   Prosper the work of our hands!  Prosper the work of our hands!            '
