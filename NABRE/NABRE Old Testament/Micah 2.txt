b'    Ah! you plotters of iniquity,  who work out evil on your beds! In the morning light you carry it out  for it lies within your power.   You covet fields, and seize them;  houses, and take them; You cheat owners of their houses,  people of their inheritance.     Therefore thus says the  Lord : Look, I am planning against this family an evil  from which you cannot free your necks; Nor shall you walk with head held high,  for it will be an evil time.  On that day you shall be mocked,  and there will be bitter lament: Our ruin is complete,  our fields are divided among our captors, The fields of my people are measured out,  and no one can get them back!   Thus you shall have no one  in the assembly of the  Lord  to allot to you a share of land.     Do not preach, they preach,  no one should preach of these things!  Shame will not overtake us.  How can it be said, house of Jacob,  Is the  Lord  short of patience;  are these the Lords deeds? Do not my words promise good  to the one who walks in justice?  But you rise up against my people as an enemy:  you have stripped off the garment from the peaceful, From those who go their way in confidence,  as though it were spoils of war.  The women of my people you drive out  from their pleasant houses; From their children you take away  forever the honor I gave them.     Get up! Leave,  this is no place to rest; Because of uncleanness that destroys  with terrible destruction.  If one possessed of a lying spirit   speaks deceitfully, saying, I will preach to you wine and strong drink,  that one would be the preacher for this people.     I will gather you, Jacob, each and every one,  I will assemble all the remnant of Israel; I will group them like a flock in the fold,  like a herd in its pasture;  the noise of the people will resound.    The one who makes a breach goes up before them;  they make a breach and pass through the gate; Their king shall go through before them,  the  Lord  at their head.            '
