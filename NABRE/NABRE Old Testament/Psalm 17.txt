b' Prayer for Rescue from Persecutors  A prayer of David. I Hear,  Lord , my plea for justice;  pay heed to my cry; Listen to my prayer  from lips without guile.  From you let my vindication come;  your eyes see what is right.  You have tested my heart,  searched it in the night.  You have tried me by fire,  but find no malice in me. My mouth has not transgressed   as others often do. As your lips have instructed me,  I have kept from the way of the lawless.  My steps have kept to your paths;  my feet have not faltered.    II  I call upon you; answer me, O God.  Turn your ear to me; hear my speech.  Show your wonderful mercy,  you who deliver with your right arm  those who seek refuge from their foes.   Keep me as the apple of your eye;  hide me in the shadow of your wings   from the wicked who despoil me.  III My ravenous enemies press upon me;     they close their hearts,  they fill their mouths with proud roaring.  Their steps even now encircle me;  they watch closely, keeping low to the ground,  Like lions eager for prey,  like a young lion lurking in ambush.  Rise, O  Lord , confront and cast them down;  rescue my soul from the wicked.  Slay them with your sword;  with your hand,  Lord , slay them;  snatch them from the world in their prime. Their bellies are being filled with your friends;  their children are satisfied too,  for they share what is left with their young.
