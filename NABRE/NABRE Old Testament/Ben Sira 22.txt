b'  On Laziness and Foolishness   The sluggard is like a filthy stone;   everyone hisses at his disgrace.  The sluggard is like a lump of dung;  whoever touches it shakes it off the hands.    An undisciplined child is a disgrace to its father;  if it be a daughter, she brings him to poverty.   A thoughtful daughter obtains a husband of her own;  a shameless one is her fathers grief.  A hussy shames her father and her husband;  she is despised by both.    Like music at the time of mourning is ill-timed talk,   but lashes and discipline are at all times wisdom.   Teaching a fool is like gluing a broken pot,   or rousing another from deep sleep.  Whoever talks with a fool talks to someone asleep;  when it is over, he says, What was that?    Weep over the dead, for their light has gone out;  weep over the fool, for sense has left him. Weep but less bitterly over the dead, for they are at rest;  worse than death is the life of a fool.  Mourning for the dead, seven days\xe2\x80\x94   but for the wicked fool, a whole lifetime.    Do not talk much with the stupid,  or visit the unintelligent. Beware of them lest you have trouble  and be spattered when they shake themselves off. Avoid them and you will find rest  and not be wearied by their lack of sense.  What is heavier than lead?  What is its name but Fool?  Sand, salt, and an iron weight  are easier to bear than the stupid person.     A wooden beam firmly bonded into a building   is not loosened by an earthquake; So the mind firmly resolved after careful deliberation  will not be afraid at any time.  The mind solidly backed by intelligent thought  is like a stucco decoration on a smooth wall.  Small stones lying on an open height  will not remain when the wind blows; So a timid mind based on foolish plans  cannot stand up to fear of any kind.   The Preservation of Friendship   Whoever jabs the eye brings tears;  whoever pierces the heart bares its feelings.  Whoever throws a stone at birds drives them away;  whoever insults a friend breaks up the friendship.  Should you draw a sword against a friend,  do not despair, for it can be undone.  Should you open your mouth against a friend,  do not worry, for you can be reconciled. But a contemptuous insult, a confidence broken,  or a treacherous attack will drive any friend away.    Win your neighbors trust while he is poor,  so that you may rejoice with him in his prosperity. In time of trouble remain true to him,  so that you may share in his inheritance when it comes.  The billowing smoke of a furnace precedes the fire,  so insults precede bloodshed.  I am not ashamed to shelter a friend,  and I will not hide from him.  But if harm should come to me because of him,  all who hear of it will beware of him.   Prayer   Who will set a guard over my mouth,  an effective seal on my lips, That I may not fail through them,  and my tongue may not destroy me?             '
