b' God the Judge of the World  For the leader. Do not destroy! A psalm of Asaph; a song.   I  We thank you, God, we give thanks;  we call upon your name,  we declare your wonderful deeds. [You said:]   I will choose the time;  I will judge fairly.  Though the earth and all its inhabitants quake,  I make steady its pillars.  Selah   II  So I say to the boastful: Do not boast!   to the wicked: Do not raise your horns!   Do not raise your horns against heaven!  Do not speak with a stiff neck!   For judgment comes not from east or from west,  not from the wilderness or the mountains,   But from God who decides,  who brings some low and raises others high.   Yes, a cup   is in the  Lord s hand,  foaming wine, fully spiced. When God pours it out,  they will drain it even to the dregs;  all the wicked of the earth will drink.   But I will rejoice forever;  I will sing praise to the God of Jacob,   [Who has said:] I will cut off all the horns of the wicked,  but the horns of the righteous will be exalted.            '
