b'  Choice of Artisans.     The  Lord  said to Moses:     See, I have singled out   Bezalel, son of Uri, son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah,     and I have filled him with a divine spirit of skill and understanding and knowledge in every craft:     in the production of embroidery, in making things of gold, silver, or bronze,     in cutting and mounting precious stones, in carving wood, and in every other craft.
