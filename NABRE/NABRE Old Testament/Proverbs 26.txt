b'  Like snow in summer, like rain in harvest,  honor for a fool is out of place.   Like the sparrow in its flitting, like the swallow in its flight,  a curse uncalled-for never lands.   The whip for the horse, the bridle for the ass,  and the rod for the back of fools.    Do not answer fools according to their folly,  lest you too become like them.  Answer fools according to their folly,  lest they become wise in their own eyes.  Those who send messages by a fool  cut off their feet; they drink down violence.   A proverb in the mouth of a fool  hangs limp, like crippled legs.  Giving honor to a fool  is like entangling a stone in the sling.  A thorn stuck in the hand of a drunkard  is a proverb in the mouth of fools.  An archer wounding all who pass by  is anyone who hires a drunken fool.  As dogs return to their vomit,  so fools repeat their folly.   You see those who are wise in their own eyes?  There is more hope for fools than for them.

The words of a talebearer are like dainty morsels:  they sink into ones inmost being.    Like a glazed finish on earthenware  are smooth lips and a wicked heart.   With their lips enemies pretend,  but inwardly they maintain deceit;  When they speak graciously, do not trust them,   for seven abominations   are in their hearts.  Hatred can be concealed by pretense,  but malice will be revealed in the assembly.   Whoever digs a pit falls into it;  and a stone comes back upon the one who rolls it.   The lying tongue is its owners enemy,  and the flattering mouth works ruin.            '
