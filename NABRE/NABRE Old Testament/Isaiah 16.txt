b'   Send them forth,   hugging the earth like reptiles,  from Sela across the desert,  to the mount of daughter Zion.  Like flushed birds,  like scattered nestlings, Are the daughters of Moab  at the fords of the Arnon.     Offer counsel, take their part;  at high noon make your shade like the night; Hide the outcasts,  do not betray the fugitives.  Let the outcasts of Moab live with you,  be their shelter from the destroyer. When there is an end to the oppressor,  when destruction has ceased,  and the marauders have vanished from the land,  A throne shall be set up in mercy,  and on it shall sit in fidelity,  in Davids tent, A judge upholding right,  prompt to do justice.   We have heard of the pride of Moab,  how very proud he is, Of his haughtiness, pride, and arrogance  that his empty words do not match.    Therefore let Moab wail,  let everyone wail for Moab; For the raisin cakes   of Kir-hareseth  let them sigh, stricken with grief.  The terraced slopes of Heshbon languish,  the vines of Sibmah, Whose clusters once overpowered  the lords of nations, Reaching as far as Jazer  winding through the wilderness,  Whose branches spread forth,  crossing over the sea.  Therefore I weep with Jazer  for the vines of Sibmah; I drench you with my tears,  Heshbon and Elealeh; For on your summer fruits and harvests  the battle cry   has fallen.   From the orchards are taken away  joy and gladness, In the vineyards there is no singing,  no shout of joy; In the wine presses no one treads grapes,  the vintage shout is stilled.   Therefore for Moab  my heart moans like a lyre,  my inmost being for Kir-hareseth.    When Moab wears himself out on the high places,  and enters his sanctuary to pray,  it shall avail him nothing.      That is the word the  Lord  spoke against Moab in times past.     But now the  Lord  speaks: In three years, like the years of a hired laborer, the glory of Moab shall be empty despite all its great multitude; and the remnant shall be very small and weak.
