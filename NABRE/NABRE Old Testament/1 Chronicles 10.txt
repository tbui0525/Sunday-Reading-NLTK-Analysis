b'  Death of Saul and His Sons.     Now the Philistines went to war against Israel, and Israel fled before them, and they fell, slain on Mount Gilboa.     The Philistines pressed hard after Saul and his sons. When the Philistines had struck down Jonathan, Abinadab, and Malchishua, sons of Saul,     the fury of the battle converged on Saul. Then the archers hit him, and he was severely wounded.    Saul said to his armor-bearer, Draw your sword and run me through; otherwise these uncircumcised will come and abuse me.
