b' The Acceptable Sacrifice  A psalm of Asaph. I The God of gods, the  Lord ,  has spoken and summoned the earth  from the rising of the sun to its setting.   From Zion, the perfection of beauty, God shines forth.   Our God comes and will not be silent!  Devouring fire precedes him,  it rages strongly around him.   He calls to the heavens above  and to the earth to judge his people:  Gather my loyal ones to me,  those who made a covenant with me by sacrifice.  The heavens proclaim his righteousness,  for God himself is the judge.  Selah   II  Listen, my people, I will speak;  Israel, I will testify against you;  God, your God, am I.  Not for your sacrifices do I rebuke you,  your burnt offerings are always before me.  I will not take a bullock from your house,  or he-goats from your folds.   For every animal of the forest is mine,  beasts by the thousands on my mountains.  I know every bird in the heights;  whatever moves in the wild is mine.  Were I hungry, I would not tell you,  for mine is the world and all that fills it.   Do I eat the flesh of bulls  or drink the blood of he-goats?  Offer praise as your sacrifice to God;   fulfill your vows to the Most High.  Then call on me on the day of distress;   I will rescue you, and you shall honor me.   III  But to the wicked God says:  Why do you recite my commandments  and profess my covenant with your mouth?  You hate discipline;  you cast my words behind you!  If you see a thief, you run with him;  with adulterers you throw in your lot.  You give your mouth free rein for evil;  you yoke your tongue to deceit.  You sit and speak against your brother,  slandering your mothers son.  When you do these things should I be silent?  Do you think that I am like you?  I accuse you, I lay out the matter before your eyes.   IV  Now understand this, you who forget God,  lest I start ripping apart and there be no rescuer.  Those who offer praise as a sacrifice honor me;  I will let him whose way is steadfast  look upon the salvation of God.             '
