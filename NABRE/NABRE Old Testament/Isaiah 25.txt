b'  Praise for Gods Deliverance and the Celebration in Zion   O  Lord , you are my God,  I extol you, I praise your name; For you have carried out your wonderful plans of old,  faithful and true.   For you have made the city a heap,  the fortified city a ruin, The castle of the insolent, a city no more,  not ever to be rebuilt.   Therefore a strong people will honor you,  ruthless nations will fear you.  For you have been a refuge to the poor,  a refuge to the needy in their distress; Shelter from the rain,  shade from the heat.  When the blast of the ruthless was like a winter rain,   the roar of strangers like heat in the desert, You subdued the heat with the shade of a cloud,  the rain of the tyrants was vanquished.  On this mountain   the  Lord  of hosts  will provide for all peoples A feast of rich food and choice wines,  juicy, rich food and pure, choice wines.  On this mountain he will destroy  the veil that veils all peoples, The web that is woven over all nations.   He will destroy death forever. The Lord  God  will wipe away  the tears from all faces; The reproach of his people he will remove  from the whole earth; for the  Lord  has spoken.    On that day it will be said: Indeed, this is our God; we looked to him, and he saved us!  This is the  Lord  to whom we looked;  let us rejoice and be glad that he has saved us!    Judgment on Moab   For the hand of the  Lord  will rest on this mountain,  but Moab will be trodden down  as straw is trodden down in the mire.   He will spread out his hands in its midst,  as a swimmer spreads out his hands to swim; His pride will be brought low  despite his strokes.   The high-walled fortress he will raze,  bringing it low, leveling it to the ground, to the very dust.             '
