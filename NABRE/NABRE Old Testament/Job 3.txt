b'   Jobs Complaint.    After this, Job opened his mouth and cursed his day.       Job spoke out and said:    Perish the day on which I was born,   the night when they said, The child is a boy!  May that day be darkness:  may God   above not care for it,  may light not shine upon it!  May darkness and gloom claim it,  clouds settle upon it,  blackness of day   affright it!  May obscurity seize that night;  may it not be counted among the days of the year,  nor enter into the number of the months!  May that night be barren;  let no joyful outcry greet it!

They wait for death and it does not come;  they search for it more than for hidden treasures.  They rejoice in it exultingly,  and are glad when they find the grave:  A man whose path is hidden from him,  one whom God has hemmed in!   For to me sighing comes more readily than food;  my groans well forth like water.  For what I feared overtakes me;  what I dreaded comes upon me.  I have no peace nor ease;  I have no rest, for trouble has come!            '
