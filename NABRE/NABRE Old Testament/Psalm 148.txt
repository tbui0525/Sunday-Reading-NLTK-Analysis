b' All Creation Summoned to Praise  Hallelujah! I Praise the  Lord  from the heavens;  praise him in the heights.  Praise him, all you his angels;  give praise, all you his hosts.   Praise him, sun and moon;  praise him, all shining stars.  Praise him, highest heavens,   you waters above the heavens.  Let them all praise the  Lord s name;  for he commanded and they were created,   Assigned them their station forever,  set an order that will never change.   II  Praise the  Lord  from the earth,  you sea monsters and all the deeps of the sea;   Lightning and hail, snow and thick clouds,  storm wind that fulfills his command;  Mountains and all hills,  fruit trees and all cedars;   Animals wild and tame,  creatures that crawl and birds that fly;   Kings of the earth and all peoples,  princes and all who govern on earth;  Young men and women too,  old and young alike.  Let them all praise the  Lord s name,  for his name alone is exalted,  His majesty above earth and heaven.    He has lifted high the horn of his people;  to the praise of all his faithful,  the Israelites, the people near to him. Hallelujah!            '
