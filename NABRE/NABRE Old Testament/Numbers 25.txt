b'  Worship of Baal of Peor.    While Israel was living at Shittim,   the people profaned themselves by prostituting themselves with the Moabite women.       These then invited the people to the sacrifices of their god, and the people ate of the sacrifices   and bowed down to their god.     Israel thereby attached itself to the Baal of Peor,   and the  Lord s anger flared up against Israel.      The  Lord  said to Moses: Gather all the leaders of the people, and publicly execute them   before the  Lord , that the blazing wrath of the  Lord  may turn away from Israel.     So Moses told the Israelite judges, Each of you kill those of his men who have attached themselves to the Baal of Peor.    Zeal of Phinehas.    At this a certain Israelite came and brought in a Midianite woman   to his kindred in the view of Moses and of the whole Israelite community, while they were weeping at the entrance of the tent of meeting.

The  Lord  then said to Moses:      Treat the Midianites as enemies and strike them,     for they have been your enemies by the deceitful dealings they had with you regarding Peor and their kinswoman Cozbi, the daughter of a Midianite prince, who was slain at the time of the plague because of Peor.
