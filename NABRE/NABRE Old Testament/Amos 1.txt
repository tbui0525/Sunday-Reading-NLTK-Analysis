b'    The words of Amos, who was one of the sheepbreeders from Tekoa,   which he received in a vision concerning Israel in the days of Uzziah, king of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam, son of Joash, king of Israel, two years before the earthquake.       He said: The  Lord  roars from Zion,   and raises his voice from Jerusalem; The pastures of the shepherds languish,  and the summit of Carmel withers.    II. Oracles Against the Nations  Aram  Thus says the  Lord : For three crimes of Damascus, and now four\xe2\x80\x94   I will not take it back\xe2\x80\x94 Because they threshed Gilead  with sledges of iron,  I will send fire upon the house of Hazael,  and it will devour the strongholds of Ben-hadad.    I will break the barred gate of Damascus;  From the Valley of Aven   I will cut off the one enthroned, And the sceptered ruler from Beth-eden;  the people of Aram shall be exiled to Kir,   says the  Lord .   Philistia  Thus says the  Lord : For three crimes of Gaza, and now four\xe2\x80\x94  I will not take it back\xe2\x80\x94 Because they exiled an entire population,  handing them over to Edom,  I will send fire upon the wall of Gaza,  and it will devour its strongholds;  From Ashdod I will cut off the one enthroned  and the sceptered ruler from Ashkelon; I will turn my hand against Ekron,  and the last of the Philistines shall perish,  says the Lord  God .

Edom  Thus says the  Lord : For three crimes of Edom, and now four\xe2\x80\x94  I will not take it back\xe2\x80\x94 Because he pursued his brother   with the sword,  suppressing all pity, Persisting in his anger,  his wrath raging without end,  I will send fire upon Teman,  and it will devour the strongholds of Bozrah.    Ammon  Thus says the  Lord : For three crimes of the Ammonites, and now four\xe2\x80\x94  I will not take it back\xe2\x80\x94 Because they ripped open pregnant women in Gilead,   in order to extend their territory,  I will kindle a fire upon the wall of Rabbah,   and it will devour its strongholds Amid war cries on the day of battle,  amid stormwind on the day of tempest.  Their king shall go into exile,  he and his princes with him, says the  Lord .            '
