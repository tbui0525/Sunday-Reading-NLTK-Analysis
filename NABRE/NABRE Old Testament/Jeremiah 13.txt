b'  Judahs Corruption.     The  Lord  said to me: Go buy yourself a linen loincloth; wear it on your loins, but do not put it in water.     I bought the loincloth, as the  Lord  commanded, and put it on.     A second time the word of the  Lord  came to me thus:     Take the loincloth which you bought and are wearing, and go at once to the Perath; hide it there in a cleft of the rock.     Obedient to the  Lord s command, I went to the Perath and buried the loincloth.     After a long time, the  Lord  said to me: Go now to the Perath and fetch the loincloth which I told you to hide there.     So I went to the Perath, looked for the loincloth and took it from the place I had hidden it. But it was rotted, good for nothing!     Then the word came to me from the  Lord :     Thus says the  Lord : So also I will allow the pride of Judah to rot, the great pride of Jerusalem.       This wicked people who refuse to obey my words, who walk in the stubbornness of their hearts and follow other gods, serving and worshiping them, will be like this loincloth, good for nothing.       For, as the loincloth clings to a mans loins, so I made the whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah cling to me\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the  Lord \xe2\x80\x94to be my people, my fame, my praise, my glory. But they did not listen.    The Broken Wineflask.    Now speak to them this word: Thus says the  Lord , the God of Israel: Every wineflask should be filled with wine. If they reply, Do we not know that every wineflask should be filled with wine?     say to them: Thus says the  Lord : Beware! I am making all the inhabitants of this land drunk, the kings who sit on Davids throne, the priests and prophets, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem.       I will smash them against each other, parents and children together\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the  Lord \xe2\x80\x94showing no compassion, I will neither spare nor pity, but I will destroy them.    A Last Warning  Listen and give ear, do not be arrogant,  for the  Lord  speaks.  Give glory to the  Lord , your God,  before he brings darkness; Before your feet stumble  on mountains at twilight; Before the light you look for turns to darkness,  changes into black clouds.   If you do not listen to this in your pride,  I will weep many tears in secret; My eyes will run with tears  for the  Lord s flock, led away to exile.    Exile  Say to the king and to the queen mother:  come down from your throne; From your heads  your splendid crowns will fall.   The cities of the Negeb are besieged,  with no one to relieve them; Judah is taken into exile\xe2\x80\x94all of it\xe2\x80\x94  in total exile.   Jerusalems Disgrace  Lift up your eyes and see  those coming in from the north. Where is the flock entrusted to you,  your splendid sheep?   What will you say when rulers are appointed over you,  those you taught to be allies? Will not pains seize you  like those of a woman giving birth?   If you say to yourself:  Why have these things happened to me? For your great guilt your skirts are stripped away  and you are violated.   Can Ethiopians change their skin,  leopards their spots? As easily would you be able to do good,  accustomed to evil as you are.   I will scatter them like chaff that flies  on the desert wind.   This is your lot, the portion I have measured out to you\xe2\x80\x94  oracle of the  Lord . Because you have forgotten me,  and trusted in deception,    I now will strip away your skirts,  so that your shame is visible.   Your adulteries, your neighings,  your shameless prostitutions: On the hills, in the fields  I see your detestable crimes. Woe to you, Jerusalem! How long will it be  before you are clean?             '
