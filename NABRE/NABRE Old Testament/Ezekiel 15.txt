b'  Parable of the Vine.     The word of the  Lord  came to me:    Son of man,  what makes the wood of the vine Better than the wood of branches  found on the trees in the forest?   Can wood be taken from it  to make something useful? Can someone make even a peg out of it  on which to hang a vessel?  Of course not! If it is fed to the fire for fuel,  and the fire devours both ends of it, Leaving the middle charred,  is it useful for anything then?  Even when it is whole  it cannot be used for anything; So when fire has devoured and charred it,  how useful can it be?  Therefore, thus says the Lord  God : Like vine wood among forest trees,  which I have given as fuel for fire, So I will give the inhabitants of Jerusalem.  I will set my face against them: Although they have escaped the fire,  the fire will still devour them; You shall know that I am the  Lord ,  when I set my face against them.   Yes, I will make the land desolate,  because they are so unfaithful\xe2\x80\x94  oracle of the Lord  God .            '
