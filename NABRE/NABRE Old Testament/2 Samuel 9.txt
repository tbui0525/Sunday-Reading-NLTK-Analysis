b'  David and Meribbaal.    David asked, Is there any survivor of Sauls house to whom I may show kindness for the sake of Jonathan?       Now there was an official of the house of Saul named Ziba. He was summoned to David, and the king asked him, Are you Ziba? He replied, Your servant.       Then the king asked, Is there any survivor of Sauls house to whom I may show Gods kindness? Ziba answered the king, There is still Jonathans son, the one whose feet are crippled.       The king asked him, Where is he? and Ziba answered the king, He is in the house of Machir, son of Ammiel, in Lodebar.

But Meribbaal, your lords son, shall always eat at my table. Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants.     Ziba answered the king, Whatever my lord the king commands his servant, so shall your servant do. And so Meribbaal ate at Davids table like one of the kings sons.       Meribbaal had a young son whose name was Mica; and all the tenants of Zibas household worked for Meribbaal.       But Meribbaal lived in Jerusalem, because he always ate at the kings table. He was lame in both feet.         '
