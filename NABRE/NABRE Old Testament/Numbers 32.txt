b'  Request of Gad and Reuben.    Now the Reubenites and Gadites had a very large number of livestock. Noticing that the land of Jazer and of Gilead   was a place suited to livestock,     the Gadites and Reubenites came to Moses and Eleazar the priest and to the leaders of the community and said,      The region of Ataroth, Dibon, Jazer, Nimrah, Heshbon, Elealeh, Sebam, Nebo and Baal-meon\xe2\x80\x94     the land which the  Lord  has laid low before the community of Israel, is a land for livestock, and your servants have livestock.     They continued, If we find favor with you, let this land be given to your servants as their possession. Do not make us cross the Jordan.   Moses Rebuke.    But Moses answered the Gadites and Reubenites: Are your kindred, then, to go to war, while you remain here?     Why do you wish to discourage the Israelites from crossing to the land the  Lord  has given them?     That is just what your ancestors did when I sent them from Kadesh-barnea to reconnoiter the land.       They went up to the Wadi Eshcol and reconnoitered the land, then so discouraged the Israelites that they would not enter the land the  Lord  had given them.      At that time the anger of the  Lord  flared up, and he swore:     None of the men twenty years old or more who have come up from Egypt will see the land I promised under oath to Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, because they have not followed me unreservedly\xe2\x80\x94      except the Kenizzite   Caleb, son of Jephunneh, the Kenizzite, and Joshua, son of Nun, since they have followed the  Lord  unreservedly.     So the anger of the  Lord  flared up against the Israelites and he made them wander in the wilderness forty years, until the whole generation that had done evil in the sight of the  Lord  had disappeared.     And now here you are, offspring of sinful stock, rising up in your ancestors place to add still more to the  Lord s blazing anger against the Israelites.     If you turn away from following him, he will again abandon them in the wilderness, and you will bring about the ruin of this entire people.   Counter Proposal.    But they approached him and said: We will only build sheepfolds here for our flocks and towns for our families;     but we ourselves will march as troops in the vanguard before the Israelites,   until we have led them to their destination. Meanwhile our families will remain in the fortified towns because of the lands inhabitants.     We will not return to our homes until all the Israelites have taken possession of their heritage.      But we will not claim any heritage with them across the Jordan and beyond, because we have received a heritage for ourselves on the eastern side of the Jordan.   Agreement Reached.     Moses said to them in reply: If you do this\xe2\x80\x94if you march as troops before the  Lord  into battle     and cross the Jordan in full force before the  Lord  until he has driven his enemies out of his way     and the land is subdued before the  Lord , then you may return here, free from every obligation to the  Lord  and to Israel, and this land will be your possession before the  Lord .       But if you do not do this, you will have sinned against the  Lord , and you can be sure that the consequences of your sin will overtake you.     Build the towns, then, for your families, and the folds for your flocks, but fulfill what you have promised.    The Gadites and Reubenites answered Moses, Your servants will do as my lord commands.      While our wives and children, our livestock and other animals remain there in the towns of Gilead,     all your servants will go across as armed troops before the  Lord  to battle, just as my lord says.    So Moses gave this command in their regard to Eleazar the priest, to Joshua, son of Nun, and to the heads of the ancestral houses of the Israelite tribes:     He said to them, If all the Gadites and Reubenites cross the Jordan with you in full force before the  Lord  into battle, the land will be subdued before you, and you will give them Gilead as a possession.     But if they will not go across in force with you before the  Lord , you will bring their wives and children and livestock across before you into Canaan, and they will possess a holding among you in the land of Canaan.    To this the Gadites and Reubenites replied, We will do what the  Lord  has ordered your servants.     We ourselves will go across in force before the  Lord  into the land of Canaan, but we will retain our hereditary property on this side of the Jordan.       So Moses gave them\xe2\x80\x94  the Gadites and Reubenites, as well as half the tribe of Manasseh, son of Joseph\xe2\x80\x94the kingdom of Sihon, king of the Amorites, and the kingdom of Og, king of Bashan, the land with its towns, and the districts of the surrounding towns.     The Gadites rebuilt the cities of Dibon, Ataroth, Aroer,     Atroth-shophan, Jazer, Jogbehah,     Beth-nimrah and Beth-haran\xe2\x80\x94fortified cities\xe2\x80\x94and sheepfolds.     The Reubenites rebuilt Heshbon, Elealeh, Kiriathaim,     Nebo, Baal-meon (names to be changed!),   and Sibmah. These towns, which they rebuilt, they called by their old names.   Other Conquests.    The descendants of Machir, son of Manasseh, went to Gilead and captured it, dispossessing the Amorites who were there.     (Moses gave Gilead to Machir,   son of Manasseh, and he settled there.)     Jair,   a descendant of Manasseh, went and captured their tent villages, and called them Havvoth-jair.       Nobah went and captured Kenath with its dependencies and called it Nobah after his own name.            '
