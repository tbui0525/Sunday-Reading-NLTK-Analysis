b' Prayer at the Destruction of the Temple  A  maskil  of Asaph. I Why, God, have you cast us off forever?    Why does your anger burn against the sheep of your pasture?   Remember your people, whom you acquired of old,  the tribe you redeemed as your own heritage,  Mount Zion where you dwell.   Direct your steps toward the utter destruction,  everything the enemy laid waste in the sanctuary.  Your foes roared triumphantly in the place of your assembly;  they set up their own tokens of victory.  They hacked away like a forester gathering boughs,  swinging his ax in a thicket of trees.  They smashed all its engraved work,  struck it with ax and pick.  They set your sanctuary on fire,  profaned your names abode by razing it to the ground.   They said in their hearts, We will destroy them all!  Burn all the assembly-places of God in the land!   Even so we have seen no signs for us,  there is no prophet any more,   no one among us who knows for how long.  How long, O God, will the enemy jeer?   Will the enemy revile your name forever?  Why draw back your hand,  why hold back your right hand within your bosom?    II   Yet you, God, are my king from of old,  winning victories throughout the earth.  You stirred up the sea by your might;   you smashed the heads of the dragons on the waters.   You crushed the heads of Leviathan,   gave him as food to the sharks.  You opened up springs and torrents,  brought dry land out of the primeval waters.   Yours the day and yours the night too;  you set the moon and sun in place.  You fixed all the limits of the earth;  summer and winter you made.   Remember how the enemy has jeered,  Lord ,  how a foolish people has reviled your name.  Do not surrender to wild animals those who praise you;  do not forget forever the life of your afflicted.  Look to your covenant,  for the recesses of the land  are full of the haunts of violence.  Let not the oppressed turn back in shame;  may the poor and needy praise your name.  Arise, God, defend your cause;  remember the constant jeering of the fools.  Do not forget the clamor of your foes,  the unceasing uproar of your enemies.            '
