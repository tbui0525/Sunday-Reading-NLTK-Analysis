b' Prayer of a Pilgrim to Jerusalem  For the leader; upon the  gittith . A psalm of the Korahites.   I  How lovely your dwelling,  O  Lord  of hosts!   My soul yearns and pines  for the courts of the  Lord .  My heart and flesh cry out  for the living God.   As the sparrow finds a home  and the swallow a nest to settle her young, My home is by your altars,  Lord  of hosts, my king and my God!   Blessed are those who dwell in your house!  They never cease to praise you. Selah   II  Blessed the man who finds refuge in you,  in their hearts are pilgrim roads.  As they pass through the Baca valley,   they find spring water to drink.  The early rain covers it with blessings.  They will go from strength to strength   and see the God of gods on Zion.   III  Lord  God of hosts, hear my prayer;  listen, God of Jacob. Selah   O God, watch over our shield;  look upon the face of your anointed.    IV  Better one day in your courts  than a thousand elsewhere. Better the threshold of the house of my God  than a home in the tents of the wicked.  For a sun and shield is the  Lord  God,  bestowing all grace and glory. The  Lord  withholds no good thing  from those who walk without reproach.  O  Lord  of hosts,  blessed the man who trusts in you!            '
