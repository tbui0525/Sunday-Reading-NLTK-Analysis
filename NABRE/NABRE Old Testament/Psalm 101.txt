b' Norm of Life for Rulers  A psalm of David. I I sing of mercy and justice;  to you,  Lord , I sing praise.  I study the way of integrity;   when will you come to me? I act with integrity of heart  within my household.    I do not allow into my presence anything base.  I hate wrongdoing;  I will have no part of it.   May the devious heart keep far from me;  the wicked I will not acknowledge.  Whoever slanders a neighbor in secret  I will reduce to silence.  Haughty eyes and arrogant hearts   I cannot endure.   II  I look to the faithful of the land   to sit at my side. Whoever follows the way of integrity   is the one to enter my service.  No one who practices deceit  can remain within my house. No one who speaks falsely  can last in my presence.    Morning after morning I clear all the wicked from the land,  to rid the city of the  Lord  of all doers of evil.            '
