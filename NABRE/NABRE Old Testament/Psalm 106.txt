b' sraels Confession of Sin  Hallelujah! A Give thanks to the  Lord , who is good,  whose mercy endures forever.   Who can recount the mighty deeds of the  Lord ,  proclaim in full Gods praise?  Blessed those who do what is right,  whose deeds are always just.   Remember me,  Lord , as you favor your people;  come to me with your saving help,   That  may see the prosperity of your chosen ones,  rejoice in the joy of your people,  and glory with your heritage.   B  We have sinned like our ancestors;   we have done wrong and are guilty.     Our ancestors in Egypt  did not attend to your wonders. They did not remember your manifold mercy;  they defied the Most High at the Red Sea.  Yet he saved them for his names sake  to make his power known.   He roared at the Red Sea and it dried up.  He led them through the deep as through a desert.   He rescued them from hostile hands,  freed them from the power of the enemy.  The waters covered their oppressors;  not one of them survived.  Then they believed his words  and sang his praise.      But they soon forgot all he had done;  they had no patience for his plan.  n the desert they gave in to their cravings,  tempted God in the wasteland.   So he gave them what they asked  and sent a wasting disease against them.      n the camp they challenged Moses   and Aaron, the holy one of the  Lord .  The earth opened and swallowed Dathan,  it closed on the followers of Abiram.  Against their company the fire blazed;  flames consumed the wicked.   V  At Horeb they fashioned a calf,   worshiped a metal statue.  They exchanged their glory   for the image of a grass-eating bull.  They forgot the God who had saved them,  who had done great deeds in Egypt,   Amazing deeds in the land of Ham,  fearsome deeds at the Red Sea.  He would have decreed their destruction,  had not Moses, his chosen one, Withstood him in the breach   to turn back his destroying anger.    V  Next they despised the beautiful land;   they did not believe the promise.  n their tents they complained;  they did not heed the voice of the  Lord .  So with raised hand he swore  he would destroy them in the desert,  And scatter their descendants among the nations,  disperse them in foreign lands.   V  They joined in the rites of Baal of Peor,   ate food sacrificed to the dead.  They provoked him by their actions,  and a plague broke out among them.  Then Phinehas rose to intervene,  and the plague was brought to a halt.  This was counted for him as a righteous deed  for all generations to come.   V  At the waters of Meribah they angered God,   and Moses suffered because of them.   They so embittered his spirit  that rash words crossed his lips.   V  They did not destroy the peoples  as the  Lord  had commanded them,   But mingled with the nations  and imitated their ways.   They served their idols  and were ensnared by them.   They sacrificed to demons   their own sons and daughters,  Shedding innocent blood,  the blood of their own sons and daughters, Whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan,  desecrating the land with bloodshed.  They defiled themselves by their actions,  became adulterers by their conduct.  So the  Lord  grew angry with his people,  abhorred his own heritage.  He handed them over to the nations,  and their adversaries ruled over them.   Their enemies oppressed them,  kept them under subjection.  Many times did he rescue them,  but they kept rebelling and scheming  and were brought low by their own guilt.   Still God had regard for their affliction  when he heard their wailing.  For their sake he remembered his covenant  and relented in his abundant mercy,   Winning for them compassion  from all who held them captive.   C  Save us,  Lord , our God;  gather us from among the nations That we may give thanks to your holy name  and glory in praising you.    Blessed be the  Lord , the God of srael,  from everlasting to everlasting!  Let all the people say, Amen!  Hallelujah!            '
