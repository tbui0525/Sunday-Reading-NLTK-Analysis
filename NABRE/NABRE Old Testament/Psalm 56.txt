b' Trust in God  For the director. According to  Yonath elem rehoqim .   A  miktam  of David, when the Philistines seized him at Gath.    I  Have mercy on me, God,  for I am treated harshly;  attackers press me all the day.  My foes treat me harshly all the day;  yes, many are my attackers. O Most High,     when I am afraid,  in you I place my trust.  I praise the word of God;  I trust in God, I do not fear.   What can mere flesh do to me?    II  All the day they foil my plans;  their every thought is of evil against me.  They hide together in ambush;  they watch my every step;  they lie in wait for my life.   They are evil; watch them, God!  Cast the nations down in your anger!  My wanderings you have noted;  are my tears not stored in your flask,   recorded in your book?   My foes turn back when I call on you.  This I know: God is on my side.  I praise the word of God,  I praise the word of the  Lord .  In God I trust, I do not fear.  What can man do to me?   III  I have made vows to you, God;  with offerings I will fulfill them,   For you have snatched me from death,  kept my feet from stumbling, That I may walk before God  in the light of the living.
