b'  Jonahs Disobedience and Flight.    The word of the  Lord  came to Jonah,   son of Amittai:       Set out for the great city   of Nineveh, and preach against it; for their wickedness has come before me.       But Jonah made ready to flee to Tarshish,   away from the  Lord . He went down to Joppa, found a ship going to Tarshish, paid the fare, and went down in it to go with them to Tarshish, away from the  Lord .     The  Lord , however, hurled a great wind upon the sea, and the storm was so great that the ship was about to break up.     Then the sailors were afraid and each one cried to his god. To lighten the ship for themselves, they threw its cargo into the sea. Meanwhile, Jonah had gone down into the hold of the ship, and lay there fast asleep.     The captain approached him and said, What are you doing asleep? Get up, call on your god! Perhaps this god will be mindful of us so that we will not perish.    Then they said to one another, Come, let us cast lots to discover on whose account this evil has come to us. So they cast lots, and the lot fell on Jonah.       They said to him, Tell us why this evil has come to us! What is your business? Where do you come from? What is your country, and to what people do you belong?

Now the men were seized with great fear and said to him, How could you do such a thing!\xe2\x80\x94They knew that he was fleeing from the  Lord , because he had told them.     They asked, What shall we do with you, that the sea may calm down for us? For the sea was growing more and more stormy.     Jonah responded, Pick me up and hurl me into the sea and then the sea will calm down for you. For I know that this great storm has come upon you because of me.    Still the men rowed hard to return to dry land, but they could not, for the sea grew more and more stormy.     Then they cried to the  Lord : Please, O  Lord , do not let us perish for taking this mans life; do not charge us with shedding innocent blood, for you,  Lord , have accomplished what you desired.       Then they picked up Jonah and hurled him into the sea, and the sea stopped raging.     Seized with great fear of the  Lord , the men offered sacrifice to the  Lord  and made vows.            '
