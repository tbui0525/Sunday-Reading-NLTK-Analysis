b' Petition and Thanksgiving  Of David. I To you,  Lord , I call;  my Rock, do not be deaf to me,  Do not be silent toward me,  so that I join those who go down to the pit.   Hear the sound of my pleading when I cry to you for help  when I lift up my hands toward your holy place.    Do not drag me off with the wicked,  with those who do wrong,  Who speak peace to their neighbors  though evil is in their hearts.   Repay them for their deeds,  for the evil that they do. For the work of their hands repay them;  give them what they deserve.   Because they do not understand the  Lord s works,  the work of his hands,  He will tear them down,  never to rebuild them.   II   Blessed be the  Lord ,  who has heard the sound of my pleading.  The  Lord  is my strength and my shield,  in whom my heart trusts. I am helped, so my heart rejoices;  with my song I praise him.   III   Lord , you are a strength for your people,  the saving refuge of your anointed.  Save your people, bless your inheritance;  pasture and carry them forever!            '
