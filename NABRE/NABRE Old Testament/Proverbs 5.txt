b'  Warning Against Adultery   My son, to my wisdom be attentive,  to understanding incline your ear,  That you may act discreetly,  and your lips guard what you know.  Indeed, the lips of the stranger drip honey,   and her mouth is smoother than oil;   But in the end she is as bitter as wormwood,  as sharp as a two-edged sword.  Her feet go down to death,  her steps reach Sheol;   Her paths ramble, you know not where,  lest you see before you the road to life.  So now, children, listen to me,  do not stray from the words of my mouth.  Keep your way far from her,   do not go near the door of her house,  Lest you give your honor   to others,   and your years to a merciless one;  Lest outsiders take their fill of your wealth,  and your hard-won earnings go to anothers house;  And you groan in the end,  when your flesh and your body are consumed;  And you say, Oh, why did I hate instruction,  and my heart spurn reproof!  Why did I not listen to the voice of my teachers,  incline my ear to my instructors!  I am all but ruined,  in the midst of the public assembly!  Drink water   from your own cistern,  running water from your own well.  Should your water sources be dispersed abroad,  streams of water in the streets?  Let them be yours alone,  not shared with outsiders;  Let your fountain be blessed and have joy of the wife of your youth,   your lovely hind, your graceful doe.  Of whose love you will ever have your fill,  and by her ardor always be intoxicated.  Why then, my son, should you be intoxicated with a stranger,  and embrace another woman?  Indeed, the ways of each person are plain to the  Lord s sight;  all their paths he surveys;   By their own iniquities the wicked will be caught,  in the meshes of their own sin they will be held fast;  They will die from lack of discipline,  lost because of their great folly.
