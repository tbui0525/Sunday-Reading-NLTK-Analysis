b'  The Anointed Bearer of Glad Tidings   The spirit of the Lord  God  is upon me,  because the  Lord  has anointed me; He has sent me to bring good news to the afflicted,  to bind up the brokenhearted, To proclaim liberty to the captives,  release to the prisoners,   To announce a year of favor from the  Lord  and a day of vindication by our God; To comfort all who mourn;    to place on those who mourn in Zion  a diadem instead of ashes, To give them oil of gladness instead of mourning,  a glorious mantle instead of a faint spirit. Restoration and Blessing They will be called oaks of justice,  the planting of the  Lord  to show his glory.  They shall rebuild the ancient ruins,  the former wastes they shall raise up And restore the desolate cities,  devastations of generation upon generation.   Strangers shall stand ready to pasture your flocks,  foreigners shall be your farmers and vinedressers.   You yourselves shall be called Priests of the  Lord ,  Ministers of our God you shall be called. You shall eat the wealth of the nations  and in their riches you will boast.   Because their shame was twofold   and disgrace was proclaimed their portion, They will possess twofold in their own land;  everlasting joy shall be theirs.    Gods Word of Promise  For I, the  Lord , love justice,  I hate robbery and wrongdoing; I will faithfully give them their recompense,  an everlasting covenant I will make with them.   Their offspring shall be renowned among the nations,  and their descendants in the midst of the peoples; All who see them shall acknowledge them:  They are offspring the  Lord  has blessed.   Thanksgiving for Gods Deliverance   I will rejoice heartily in the  Lord ,  my being exults in my God; For he has clothed me with garments of salvation,  and wrapped me in a robe of justice, Like a bridegroom adorned with a diadem,  as a bride adorns herself with her jewels.   As the earth brings forth its shoots,  and a garden makes its seeds spring up, So will the Lord  God  make justice spring up,  and praise before all the nations.            '
