b' Praise of Divine Goodness  Of David. I Bless the  Lord , my soul;  all my being, bless his holy name!  Bless the  Lord , my soul;  and do not forget all his gifts,  Who pardons all your sins,  and heals all your ills,  Who redeems your life from the pit,   and crowns you with mercy and compassion,  Who fills your days with good things,  so your youth is renewed like the eagles.    II  The  Lord  does righteous deeds,  brings justice to all the oppressed.   He made known his ways to Moses,  to the Israelites his deeds.  Merciful and gracious is the  Lord ,  slow to anger, abounding in mercy.   He will not always accuse,  and nurses no lasting anger;  He has not dealt with us as our sins merit,  nor requited us as our wrongs deserve.   III  For as the heavens tower over the earth,  so his mercy towers over those who fear him.   As far as the east is from the west,  so far has he removed our sins from us.  As a father has compassion on his children,  so the  Lord  has compassion on those who fear him.  For he knows how we are formed,  remembers that we are dust.   As for man, his days are like the grass;  he blossoms like a flower in the field.   A wind sweeps over it and it is gone;  its place knows it no more.  But the  Lord s mercy is from age to age,  toward those who fear him. His salvation is for the childrens children   of those who keep his covenant,  and remember to carry out his precepts.   IV  The  Lord  has set his throne in heaven;  his dominion extends over all.  Bless the  Lord , all you his angels,   mighty in strength, acting at his behest,  obedient to his command.  Bless the  Lord , all you his hosts,  his ministers who carry out his will.  Bless the  Lord , all his creatures,  everywhere in his domain.  Bless the  Lord , my soul!            '
