b'  Ratification of the Covenant.    Moses himself was told: Come up to the  Lord , you and Aaron, with Nadab, Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel. You shall bow down at a distance.     Moses alone is to come close to the  Lord ; the others shall not come close, and the people shall not come up with them.    When Moses came to the people and related all the words and ordinances of the  Lord , they all answered with one voice, We will do everything that the  Lord  has told us.       Moses then wrote down all the words of the  Lord  and, rising early in the morning, he built at the foot of the mountain an altar and twelve sacred stones   for the twelve tribes of Israel.      Then, having sent young men of the Israelites to offer burnt offerings and sacrifice young bulls as communion offerings to the  Lord ,     Moses took half of the blood and put it in large bowls; the other half he splashed on the altar.     Taking the book of the covenant, he read it aloud to the people, who answered, All that the  Lord  has said, we will hear and do.     Then he took the blood and splashed it on the people, saying, This is the blood of the covenant which the  Lord  has made with you according to all these words.

So Moses set out with Joshua, his assistant, and went up to the mountain of God.     He told the elders, Wait here for us until we return to you. Aaron and Hur are with you. Anyone with a complaint should approach them.     Moses went up the mountain. Then the cloud covered the mountain.     The glory of the  Lord  settled upon Mount Sinai. The cloud covered it for six days, and on the seventh day he called to Moses from the midst of the cloud.       To the Israelites the glory of the  Lord  was seen as a consuming fire on the top of the mountain.       But Moses entered into the midst of the cloud and went up on the mountain. He was on the mountain for forty days and forty nights.             '
