b'  The Lords Wrath and Zions Ruin   How the Lord in his wrath  has abhorred daughter Zion, Casting down from heaven to earth  the glory of Israel,  Not remembering his footstool  on the day of his wrath!    The Lord has devoured without pity  all of Jacobs dwellings; In his fury he has razed  daughter Judahs defenses, Has brought to the ground in dishonor  a kingdom and its princes.    In blazing wrath, he cut down entirely  the horn   of Israel; He withdrew the support of his right hand  when the enemy approached; He burned against Jacob like a blazing fire  that consumes everything in its path.    He bent his bow like an enemy;  the arrow in his right hand Like a foe, he killed  all those held precious; On the tent of daughter Zion  he poured out his wrath like fire.    The Lord has become the enemy,  he has devoured Israel: Devoured all its strongholds,  destroyed its defenses, Multiplied moaning and groaning  throughout daughter Judah.    He laid waste his booth like a garden,  destroyed his shrine;  The  Lord  has blotted out in Zion  feast day and sabbath, Has scorned in fierce wrath  king and priest.     The Lord has rejected his altar,  spurned his sanctuary; He has handed over to the enemy  the walls of its strongholds. They shout in the house of the  Lord  as on a feast day.     The  Lord  was bent on destroying  the wall of daughter Zion: He stretched out the measuring line;   did not hesitate to devour, Brought grief on rampart and wall  till both succumbed.     Her gates sank into the ground;  he smashed her bars to bits. Her king and her princes are among the nations;  instruction is wanting, Even her prophets do not obtain  any vision from the  Lord .     The elders of daughter Zion  sit silently on the ground; They cast dust   on their heads  and dress in sackcloth; The young women of Jerusalem  bow their heads to the ground.     My eyes are spent with tears,  my stomach churns;  My bile is poured out on the ground  at the brokenness of the daughter of my people, As children and infants collapse  in the streets of the town.     They cry out to their mothers,  Where is bread and wine? As they faint away like the wounded  in the streets of the city, As their life is poured out  in their mothers arms.    To what can I compare you  \xe2\x80\x94to what can I liken you\xe2\x80\x94  O daughter Jerusalem? What example can I give in order to comfort you,  virgin daughter Zion? For your breach is vast as the sea;  who could heal you?     Your prophets provided you visions  of whitewashed illusion; They did not lay bare your guilt,  in order to restore your fortunes; They saw for you only oracles  of empty deceit.     All who pass by on the road,  clap their hands at you; They hiss and wag their heads  over daughter Jerusalem: Is this the city they used to call  perfect in beauty and joy of all the earth?     They open their mouths against you,  all your enemies; They hiss and gnash their teeth,  saying, We have devoured her! How we have waited for this day\xe2\x80\x94  we have lived to see it!     The  Lord  has done what he planned.  He has fulfilled the threat Decreed from days of old,  destroying without pity! He let the enemy gloat over you  and exalted the horn of your foes.     Cry out to the Lord from your heart,  wall of daughter Zion! Let your tears flow like a torrent  day and night; Give yourself no rest,  no relief for your eyes.    Rise up! Wail in the night,  at the start of every watch; Pour out your heart like water  before the Lord; Lift up your hands to him  for the lives of your children, Who collapse from hunger  at the corner of every street.     Look, O  Lord , and pay attention:  to whom have you been so ruthless? Must women eat their own offspring,   the very children they have borne? Are priest and prophet to be slain  in the sanctuary of the Lord?     They lie on the ground in the streets,  young and old alike; Both my young women and young men  are cut down by the sword; You killed them on the day of your wrath,  slaughtered without pity.     You summoned as to a feast day  terrors on every side; On the day of the  Lord s wrath,  none survived or escaped. Those I have borne and nurtured,  my enemy has utterly destroyed.             '
