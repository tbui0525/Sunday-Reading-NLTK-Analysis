b' The Fate of Sinners and the Reward of the Just  Of David. Aleph Do not be provoked by evildoers;  do not envy those who do wrong.   Like grass they wither quickly;  like green plants they wilt away.    Beth  Trust in the  Lord  and do good  that you may dwell in the land   and live secure.   Find your delight in the  Lord  who will give you your hearts desire.    Gimel  Commit your way to the  Lord ;  trust in him and he will act   And make your righteousness shine like the dawn,  your justice like noonday.    Daleth  Be still before the  Lord ;  wait for him. Do not be provoked by the prosperous,  nor by malicious schemers.   He  Refrain from anger; abandon wrath;  do not be provoked; it brings only harm.  Those who do evil will be cut off,  but those who wait for the  Lord  will inherit the earth.    Waw  Wait a little, and the wicked will be no more;  look for them and they will not be there.  But the poor will inherit the earth,   will delight in great prosperity.   Zayin  The wicked plot against the righteous  and gnash their teeth at them;  But my Lord laughs at them,   because he sees that their day is coming.   Heth  The wicked unsheath their swords;  they string their bows To fell the poor and oppressed,  to slaughter those whose way is upright.   Their swords will pierce their own hearts;  their bows will be broken.   Teth  Better the meagerness of the righteous one  than the plenty of the wicked.   The arms of the wicked will be broken,  while the  Lord  will sustain the righteous.   Yodh  The  Lord  knows the days of the blameless;  their heritage lasts forever.  They will not be ashamed when times are bad;  in days of famine they will be satisfied.   Kaph  The wicked perish,  enemies of the  Lord ; They shall be consumed like fattened lambs;  like smoke they disappear.    Lamedh  The wicked one borrows but does not repay;  the righteous one is generous and gives.  For those blessed by the Lord will inherit the earth,  but those accursed will be cut off.   Mem  The valiant one whose steps are guided by the  Lord ,  who will delight in his way,   May stumble, but he will never fall,  for the  Lord  holds his hand.   Nun  Neither in my youth, nor now in old age  have I seen the righteous one abandoned   or his offspring begging for bread.  All day long he is gracious and lends,  and his offspring become a blessing.   Samekh  Turn from evil and do good,  that you may be settled forever.   For the  Lord  loves justice  and does not abandon the faithful. Ayin When the unjust are destroyed,  and the offspring of the wicked cut off,  The righteous will inherit the earth  and dwell in it forever.    Pe  The mouth of the righteous utters wisdom;   his tongue speaks what is right.  Gods teaching is in his heart;   his steps do not falter.   Sadhe  The wicked spies on the righteous  and seeks to kill him.  But the  Lord  does not abandon him in his power,  nor let him be condemned when tried.   Qoph  Wait eagerly for the  Lord ,  and keep his way;  He will raise you up to inherit the earth;  you will see when the wicked are cut off.   Resh  I have seen a ruthless scoundrel,  spreading out like a green cedar.   When I passed by again, he was gone;  though I searched, he could not be found.   Shin  Observe the person of integrity and mark the upright;  Because there is a future for a man of peace.   Sinners will be destroyed together;  the future of the wicked will be cut off.   Taw  The salvation of the righteous is from the  Lord ,  their refuge in a time of distress.   The  Lord  helps and rescues them,  rescues and saves them from the wicked,  because they take refuge in him.            '
