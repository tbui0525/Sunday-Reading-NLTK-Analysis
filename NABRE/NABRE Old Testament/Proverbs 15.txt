b'    A mild answer turns back wrath,   but a harsh word stirs up anger.   The tongue of the wise pours out knowledge,  but the mouth of fools spews folly.  The eyes of the  Lord  are in every place,  keeping watch on the evil and the good.  A soothing tongue is a tree of life,  but a perverse one breaks the spirit.  The fool spurns a fathers instruction,  but whoever heeds reproof is prudent.    In the house of the just there are ample resources,  but the harvest of the wicked is in peril.  The lips of the wise spread knowledge,  but the heart of fools is not steadfast.   The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the  Lord ,   but the prayer of the upright is his delight.  The way of the wicked is an abomination to the  Lord ,  but he loves one who pursues justice.   Discipline seems bad to those going astray;  one who hates reproof will die.   Sheol and Abaddon   lie open before the  Lord ;  how much more the hearts of mortals!  Scoffers do not love reproof;  to the wise they will not go.  A glad heart lights up the face,  but an anguished heart breaks the spirit.   The discerning heart seeks knowledge,  but the mouth of fools feeds on folly.   All the days of the poor are evil,  but a good heart is a continual feast.    Better a little with fear of the  Lord  than a great fortune with anxiety.  Better a dish of herbs where love is  than a fatted ox and hatred with it.  The ill-tempered stir up strife,   but the patient settle disputes.  The way of the sluggard is like a thorn hedge,  but the path of the diligent is a highway.  A wise son gives his father joy,  but a fool despises his mother.   Folly is joy   to the senseless,  but the person of understanding goes the straight way.  Plans fail when there is no counsel,  but they succeed when advisers are many.    One has joy from an apt response;  a word in season, how good it is!    The path of life leads upward for the prudent,  turning them from Sheol below.   The  Lord  pulls down the house of the proud,  but preserves intact the widows landmark.  The schemes of the wicked are an abomination to the  Lord ,   but gracious words are pure.   The greedy tear down their own house,  but those who hate bribes will live.   The heart of the just ponders a response,  but the mouth of the wicked spews evil.  The  Lord  is far from the wicked,  but hears the prayer of the just.  A cheerful glance brings joy to the heart;  good news invigorates the bones.  The ear that listens to salutary reproof   is at home among the wise.   Those who disregard discipline hate themselves,  but those who heed reproof acquire understanding.  The fear of the  Lord  is training for wisdom,  and humility goes before honors.             '
