b'   O death! How bitter is the thought of you   for the one at peace in his home, For the one who is serene and always successful,  who can still enjoy lifes pleasures.  O death! How welcome is your sentence  to the weak, failing in strength, Stumbling and tripping on everything,  with sight gone and hope lost.   Do not fear deaths decree for you;  remember, it embraces those before you and those to come.   This decree for all flesh is from God;  why then should you reject a law of the Most High? Whether one has lived a thousand years, a hundred, or ten,  in Sheol there are no arguments about life.    The children of sinners are a reprobate line,   and witless offspring are in the homes of the wicked.

Before father and mother be ashamed of immorality,  before prince and ruler, of falsehood;  Before master and mistress, of deceit;  before the public assembly, of crime; Before associate and friend, of disloyalty,   and in the place where you settle, of theft. Be ashamed of breaking an oath or a covenant,  and of stretching your elbow at dinner; Of refusing to give when asked,   of rebuffing your own relatives; Of defrauding another of his appointed share, 20a  of failing to return a greeting; 21c Of gazing at a mans wife, 20b  of entertaining thoughts about another woman;   Of trifling with a servant girl you have,  of violating her bed; Of using harsh words with friends,  of following up your gifts with insults;             '
