b' Prayer of the King in Time of Danger  For the leader; with stringed instruments. Of David.   I  Hear my cry, O God,  listen to my prayer!  From the ends of the earth   I call;  my heart grows faint. Raise me up, set me on a rock,   for you are my refuge,  a tower of strength against the foe.   Let me dwell in your tent forever,  take refuge in the shelter of your wings.  Selah   II   For you, O God, have heard my vows,  you have granted me the heritage of those who revere your name.  Add days to the life of the king;  may his years be as from generation to generation;    May he reign before God forever;  send your love and fidelity   to preserve him\xe2\x80\x94   I will duly sing to your name forever,  fulfill my vows day after day.
