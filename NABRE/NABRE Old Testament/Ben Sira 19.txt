b'   Whoever does this grows no richer;  those who waste the little they have will be stripped bare.  Wine and women make the heart lustful,  and the companion of prostitutes becomes reckless.   Rottenness and worms will possess him,  and the reckless will be snatched away.   Whoever trusts others too quickly has a shallow mind,  and those who sin wrong themselves.   The Proper Use of Speech   Whoever gloats over evil will be destroyed,   and whoever repeats gossip has no sense.  Never repeat gossip,  and no one will reproach you.   Tell nothing to friend or foe;  and unless it be a sin for you, do not reveal a thing.   For someone may have heard you and watched you,  and in time come to hate you.  Let anything you hear die with you;  never fear, it will not make you burst!  Having heard something, the fool goes into labor,  like a woman giving birth to a child.

Better are the God-fearing who have little understanding  than those of great intelligence who violate the Law.    There is a shrewdness keen but dishonest,  and there are those who are duplicitous to win a judgment.  There is the villain bowed in grief,  but full of deceit within.  He hides his face and pretends not to hear,  but when not observed, he will take advantage of you:  Even if his lack of strength keeps him from sinning,  when he finds the right time he will do harm.  People are known by their appearance;  the sensible are recognized as such when first met.  Ones attire, hearty laughter, and gait  proclaim him for what he is.            '
