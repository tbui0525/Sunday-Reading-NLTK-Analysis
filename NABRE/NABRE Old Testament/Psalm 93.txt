b' God Is a Mighty King  The  Lord  is king,   robed with majesty;  the  Lord  is robed, girded with might.  The world will surely stand in place,  never to be moved.   Your throne stands firm from of old;  you are from everlasting.    The flood has raised up,  Lord ;  the flood has raised up its roar;  the flood has raised its pounding waves.  More powerful than the roar of many waters,  more powerful than the breakers of the sea,  powerful in the heavens is the  Lord .  Your decrees are firmly established;  holiness befits your house,  Lord ,  for all the length of days.            '
