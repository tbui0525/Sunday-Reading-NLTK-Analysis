b'  True and False Worship    Thus says the  Lord : The heavens are my throne,  the earth, my footstool. What house can you build for me?  Where is the place of my rest?   My hand made all these things  when all of them came to be\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the  Lord . This is the one whom I approve:  the afflicted one, crushed in spirit,  who trembles at my word.    The one slaughtering an ox, striking a man,  sacrificing a lamb, breaking a dogs neck, Making an offering of pigs blood,  burning incense, honoring an idol\xe2\x80\x94 These have chosen their own ways,  and taken pleasure in their own abominations.   I in turn will choose affliction for them  and bring upon them what they fear. Because when I called, no one answered,  when I spoke, no one listened. Because they did what was evil in my sight,  and things I do not delight in they chose,   Hear the word of the  Lord ,  you who tremble at his word! Your kin who hate you  and cast you out because of my name say, May the  Lord  show his glory,  that we may see your joy;  but they shall be put to shame.  A voice roaring from the city,  a voice from the temple; The voice of the  Lord  rendering recompense to his enemies!    Blessings of Prosperity and Consolation   Before she is in labor,  she gives birth;  Before her pangs come upon her,  she delivers a male child.  Who ever heard of such a thing,  or who ever saw the like? Can a land be brought forth in one day,  or a nation be born in a single moment? Yet Zion was scarcely in labor  when she bore her children.  Shall I bring a mother to the point of birth,  and yet not let her child be born? says the  Lord . Or shall I who bring to birth  yet close her womb? says your God.   Rejoice with Jerusalem and be glad because of her,  all you who love her; Rejoice with her in her joy,  all you who mourn over her\xe2\x80\x94   So that you may nurse and be satisfied  from her consoling breast; That you may drink with delight  at her abundant breasts!   For thus says the  Lord : I will spread prosperity over her like a river,  like an overflowing torrent,  the wealth of nations. You shall nurse, carried in her arms,  cradled upon her knees;  As a mother comforts her child,  so I will comfort you;  in Jerusalem you shall find your comfort.   You will see and your heart shall exult,  and your bodies shall flourish like the grass; The  Lord s power shall be revealed to his servants,  but to his enemies, his wrath.  For see, the  Lord  will come in fire,  his chariots like the stormwind; To wreak his anger in burning rage  and his rebuke in fiery flames.  For with fire the  Lord  shall enter into judgment,  and, with his sword, against all flesh;  Those slain by the  Lord  shall be many.      Those who sanctify and purify themselves to go into the gardens, following one who stands within, eating pigs flesh, abominable things, and mice, shall all together come to an end, with their deeds and purposes\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the  Lord .   God Gathers the Nations.     I am coming to gather all nations and tongues; they shall come and see my glory.       I will place a sign among them; from them I will send survivors to the nations: to Tarshish, Put and Lud, Mosoch, Tubal and Javan, to the distant coastlands which have never heard of my fame, or seen my glory; and they shall proclaim my glory among the nations.     They shall bring all your kin from all the nations as an offering to the  Lord , on horses and in chariots, in carts, upon mules and dromedaries, to Jerusalem, my holy mountain, says the  Lord , just as the Israelites bring their grain offering in a clean vessel to the house of the  Lord .     Some of these I will take as priests and Levites, says the  Lord .    Just as the new heavens and the new earth  which I am making Shall endure before me\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the  Lord \xe2\x80\x94  so shall your descendants and your name endure.   From new moon to new moon,  and from sabbath to sabbath, All flesh shall come to worship  before me, says the  Lord .    They shall go out and see the corpses   of the people who rebelled against me; For their worm shall not die,  their fire shall not be extinguished;  and they shall be an abhorrence to all flesh.
