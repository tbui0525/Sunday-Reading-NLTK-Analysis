b'  Infidelity of Israel.     The word of the  Lord  came to me:     Go, cry out this message for Jerusalem to hear! I remember the devotion   of your youth,  how you loved me as a bride, Following me in the wilderness,  in a land unsown.   Israel was dedicated to the  Lord ,  the first fruits   of his harvest; All who ate of it were held guilty,  evil befell them\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the  Lord .   Listen to the word of the  Lord , house of Jacob!  All you clans of the house of Israel,   thus says the  Lord : What fault did your ancestors find in me  that they withdrew from me, Went after emptiness,  and became empty themselves?   They did not ask, Where is the  Lord  who brought us up from the land of Egypt, Who led us through the wilderness,  through a land of wastes and ravines, A land of drought and darkness,  a land which no one crosses,  where no one dwells?   I brought you into the garden land  to eat its fine fruits, But you entered and defiled my land,  you turned my heritage into an abomination.   The priests did not ask,  Where is the  Lord ? The experts in the law   did not know me:  the shepherds rebelled against me. The prophets prophesied by Baal,  and went after useless idols.   Therefore I will again accuse you\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the  Lord \xe2\x80\x94  even your childrens children I will accuse.   Cross to the coast of Cyprus and see,  send to Kedar   and carefully inquire:  Where has anything like this been done?  Does any other nation change its gods?\xe2\x80\x94  even though they are not gods at all! But my people have changed their glory  for useless things.   Be horrified at this, heavens;  shudder, be appalled\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the  Lord .  Two evils my people have done:  they have forsaken me, the source of living waters; They have dug themselves cisterns,  broken cisterns that cannot hold water.   Is Israel a slave, a house-born servant?   Why then has he become plunder?  Against him lions roar,  they raise their voices. They have turned his land into a waste;  his cities are charred ruins, without an inhabitant.   Yes, the people of Memphis   and Tahpanhes  shave the crown of your head.  Has not forsaking the  Lord , your God,  done this to you?   And now, why go to Egypt,   to drink the waters of the Nile? Why go to Assyria,  to drink the waters of the River?  Your own wickedness chastises you,  your own infidelities punish you. Know then, and see, how evil and bitter  is your forsaking the  Lord , your God, And your showing no fear of me,  oracle of the Lord, the  God  of hosts.   Long ago you broke your yoke,   you tore off your bonds.  You said, I will not serve. On every high hill, under every green tree,  you sprawled and served as a prostitute.   But I had planted you as a choice vine,  all pedigreed stock; How could you turn out so obnoxious to me,  a spurious vine?   Even if you scour it with lye,  and use much soap, The stain of your guilt is still before me,  oracle of the Lord  God .   How can you say, I am not defiled,  I have not pursued the Baals? Consider your conduct in the Valley,   recall what you have done: A skittish young camel,  running back and forth,   a wild donkey bred in the wilderness, Sniffing the wind in her desire\xe2\x80\x94  who can restrain her lust? None seeking her need tire themselves;  in her time they will find her.  Stop wearing out your feet  and parching your throat! But you say, No use! No!  How I love these strangers,  after them I must go.   As the thief is shamed when caught,  so shall the house of Israel be shamed: They, their kings, their princes,  their priests and their prophets;   They say to a piece of wood, You are my father,  and to a stone, You gave me birth. They turn their backs to me, not their faces;  yet in their time of trouble they cry out,  Rise up and save us!  Where are the gods you made for yourselves?  Let them rise up!  Will they save you in your time of trouble? For as numerous as your cities  are your gods, O Judah! And as many as the streets of Jerusalem  are the altars you have set up for Baal.   Why are you arguing with me?  You have all rebelled against me\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the  Lord .  In vain I struck your children;  correction they did not take. Your sword devoured your prophets  like a ravening lion.   You people of this generation,  consider the word of the Lord: Have I become a wilderness to Israel,  a land of gloom? Why then do my people say, We have moved on,  we will not come to you any more?  Does a young woman forget her jewelry,  a bride her sash? Yet my people have forgotten me  days without number.   How well you pick your way  when seeking love! In your wickedness,  you have gone by ways unclean!  On your clothing is  the life-blood of the innocent,  you did not find them committing burglary;  Nonetheless you say, I am innocent;  at least, his anger is turned away from me. Listen! I will judge you  on that word of yours, I have not sinned.  How frivolous you have become  in changing your course! By Egypt you will be shamed,  just as you were shamed by Assyria.   From there too you will go out,  your hands upon your head; For the  Lord  has rejected those in whom you trust,  with them you will have no success.             '
