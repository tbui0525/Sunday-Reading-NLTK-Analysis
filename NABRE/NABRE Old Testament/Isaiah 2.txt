b'    This is what Isaiah, son of Amoz, saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem.   Zion, the Royal City of God    In days to come, The mountain of the  Lord s house  shall be established as the highest mountain  and raised above the hills. All nations shall stream toward it.    Many peoples shall come and say: Come, let us go up to the  Lord s mountain,  to the house of the God of Jacob, That he may instruct us in his ways,  and we may walk in his paths.  For from Zion shall go forth instruction,  and the word of the  Lord  from Jerusalem.   He shall judge between the nations,  and set terms for many peoples. They shall beat their swords into plowshares  and their spears into pruning hooks;  One nation shall not raise the sword against another,  nor shall they train for war again.    House of Jacob, come,  let us walk in the light of the  Lord !   The Lords Day of Judgment on Pride  You have abandoned your people,  the house of Jacob! Because they are filled with diviners,  and soothsayers, like the Philistines;  with foreigners they clasp hands.   Their land is full of silver and gold,  there is no end to their treasures; Their land is full of horses,  there is no end to their chariots.  Their land is full of idols;  they bow down to the works of their hands,  what their fingers have made.   So all shall be abased,  each one brought low.   Do not pardon them!  Get behind the rocks,  hide in the dust, From the terror of the  Lord  and the splendor of his majesty!  The eyes of human pride shall be lowered,  the arrogance of mortals shall be abased,  and the  Lord  alone will be exalted, on that day.   For the  Lord  of hosts will have his day  against all that is proud and arrogant,  against all that is high, and it will be brought low;  Yes, against all the cedars of Lebanon   and against all the oaks of Bashan,  Against all the lofty mountains  and all the high hills,  Against every lofty tower  and every fortified wall,  Against all the ships of Tarshish  and all stately vessels.  Then human pride shall be abased,  the arrogance of mortals brought low, And the  Lord  alone will be exalted on that day.   The idols will vanish completely.  People will go into caves in the rocks  and into holes in the earth, At the terror of the  Lord  and the splendor of his majesty,  as he rises to overawe the earth.  On that day people shall throw to moles and bats  their idols of silver and their idols of gold  which they made for themselves to worship.  And they shall go into caverns in the rocks  and into crevices in the cliffs, At the terror of the  Lord  and the splendor of his majesty,  as he rises to overawe the earth.   As for you, stop worrying about mortals,  in whose nostrils is but a breath;  for of what worth are they?            '
