b' A Hymn of Thanksgiving for Gods Fidelity  A psalm. A sabbath song.   I  It is good to give thanks to the  Lord ,  to sing praise to your name, Most High,   To proclaim your love at daybreak,  your faithfulness in the night,  With the ten-stringed harp,  with melody upon the lyre.   For you make me jubilant,  Lord , by your deeds;  at the works of your hands I shout for joy.   II  How great are your works,  Lord !   How profound your designs!  A senseless person cannot know this;  a fool cannot comprehend.  Though the wicked flourish like grass   and all sinners thrive, They are destined for eternal destruction;   but you,  Lord , are forever on high.  Indeed your enemies,  Lord ,  indeed your enemies shall perish;  all sinners shall be scattered.    III  You have given me the strength of a wild ox;   you have poured rich oil upon me.   My eyes look with glee on my wicked enemies;  my ears shall hear what happens to my wicked foes.   The just shall flourish like the palm tree,  shall grow like a cedar of Lebanon.    Planted in the house of the  Lord ,  they shall flourish in the courts of our God.  They shall bear fruit even in old age,  they will stay fresh and green,  To proclaim: The  Lord  is just;  my rock, in whom there is no wrong.             '
