b' The Blessings of the Just  Hallelujah! Blessed the man who fears the  Lord ,  who greatly delights in his commands.   His descendants shall be mighty in the land,  a generation of the upright will be blessed.  Wealth and riches shall be in his house;  his righteousness   shall endure forever.  Light shines through the darkness for the upright;   gracious, compassionate, and righteous.  It is good for the man gracious in lending,  who conducts his affairs with justice.  For he shall never be shaken;  the righteous shall be remembered forever.   He shall not fear an ill report;  his heart is steadfast, trusting the  Lord .  His heart is tranquil, without fear,  till at last he looks down on his foes.  Lavishly he gives to the poor;  his righteousness shall endure forever;   his horn   shall be exalted in honor.  The wicked sees and is angry;  gnashes his teeth and wastes away;  the desire of the wicked come to nothing.            '
