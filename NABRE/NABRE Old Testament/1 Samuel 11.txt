b'  Defeat of the Ammonites.     About a month later, Nahash the Ammonite went up and besieged Jabesh-gilead. All the people of Jabesh begged Nahash, Make a treaty with us, and we will serve you.       But Nahash the Ammonite replied, This is my condition for making a treaty with you: I will gouge out the right eye of every man,   and thus bring shame on all Israel.     The elders of Jabesh said to him: Give us seven days to send messengers throughout the territory of Israel. If there is no one to save us, we will surrender to you.     When the messengers arrived at Gibeah of Saul and reported the news in the peoples hearing, they all wept aloud.     Just then Saul came in from the field, behind his oxen. Why are the people weeping? he asked. They repeated the message of the inhabitants of Jabesh for him.

The people then said to Samuel: Who questioned whether Saul should rule over us? Hand them over and we will put them to death.       But Saul objected, No one will be put to death this day, for today the  Lord  has rescued Israel.       Samuel said to the people, Come, let us go to Gilgal to renew the kingship there.     So all the people went to Gilgal, and there they made Saul king in the  Lord s presence.
