b'  Jotham.     Jotham was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. His mothers name was Jerusha, daughter of Zadok.     He did what was right in the  Lord s sight, just as his father Uzziah had done, though he did not enter the temple of the  Lord . The people, however, continued to act corruptly.    It was he who built the Upper Gate of the  Lord s house and did much construction on the wall of Ophel.     Moreover, he built cities in the hill country of Judah, and in the wooded areas he set up fortresses and towers.     He fought with the king of the Ammonites and conquered them. That year the Ammonites paid him one hundred talents of silver, together with ten thousand kors of wheat and ten thousand of barley. They brought the same to him also in the second and in the third year.     Thus Jotham continued to grow strong because he made sure to walk before the  Lord , his God.      The rest of the acts of Jotham, his wars and his activities, are recorded in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.     He was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem.     Jotham rested with his ancestors and was buried in the City of David, and his son Ahaz succeeded him as king.        '
