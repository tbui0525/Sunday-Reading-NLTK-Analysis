b'  An Invitation to Grace  All you who are thirsty,   come to the water! You who have no money,  come, buy grain and eat; Come, buy grain without money,  wine and milk without cost!   Why spend your money for what is not bread;  your wages for what does not satisfy? Only listen to me, and you shall eat well,  you shall delight in rich fare.  Pay attention and come to me;  listen, that you may have life. I will make with you an everlasting covenant,  the steadfast loyalty promised to David.   As I made him a witness to peoples,  a leader and commander of peoples,  So shall you summon a nation you knew not,  and a nation   that knew you not shall run to you, Because of the  Lord , your God,  the Holy One of Israel, who has glorified you.      Seek the  Lord  while he may be found,  call upon him while he is near.  Let the wicked forsake their way,  and sinners their thoughts; Let them turn to the  Lord  to find mercy;  to our God, who is generous in forgiving.  For my thoughts are not your thoughts,  nor are your ways my ways\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the  Lord .  For as the heavens are higher than the earth,  so are my ways higher than your ways,  my thoughts higher than your thoughts.     Yet just as from the heavens  the rain and snow come down And do not return there  till they have watered the earth,  making it fertile and fruitful, Giving seed to the one who sows  and bread to the one who eats,  So shall my word be  that goes forth from my mouth; It shall not return to me empty,  but shall do what pleases me,  achieving the end for which I sent it.    Yes, in joy you shall go forth,  in peace you shall be brought home; Mountains and hills shall break out in song before you,  all trees of the field shall clap their hands.  In place of the thornbush, the cypress shall grow,  instead of nettles,   the myrtle. This shall be to the  Lord s renown,  as an everlasting sign that shall not fail.            '
