In green pastures he makes me lie down;  to still waters he leads me;    he restores my soul. He guides me along right paths   for the sake of his name.  Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,   I will fear no evil, for you are with me;  your rod and your staff comfort me.   II   You set a table before me  in front of my enemies; You anoint my head with oil;   my cup overflows.   Indeed, goodness and mercy   will pursue me  all the days of my life; I will dwell in the house of the  Lord   for endless days.            '
