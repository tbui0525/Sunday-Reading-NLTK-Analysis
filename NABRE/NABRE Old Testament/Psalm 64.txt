b' Treacherous Conspirators Punished by God  For the leader. A psalm of David.   I  O God, hear my anguished voice;  from a dreadful foe protect my life.  Hide me from the malicious crowd,  the mob of evildoers.  They sharpen their tongues like swords,  bend their bows of poison words.   They shoot at the innocent from ambush,  they shoot him in a moment and do not fear.  They resolve on their wicked plan;  they conspire to set snares;  they say: Who will see us?  They devise wicked schemes,  conceal the schemes they devise;  the designs of their hearts are hidden.    II  God shoots an arrow at them;  in a moment they are struck down.   They are brought down by their own tongues;  all who see them flee.   Every person fears and proclaims Gods actions,  they ponder his deeds.  The righteous rejoices and takes refuge in the  Lord ;  all the upright give praise.             '
