b'   At this moment on the mountains  the footsteps of one bearing good news,  of one announcing peace!  Celebrate your feasts, Judah,  fulfill your vows! For never again will destroyers invade you;   they are completely cut off.   The Attack on Nineveh  One who scatters has come up against you;   guard the rampart, Watch the road, brace yourselves,  marshal all your strength!   The  Lord  will restore the vine of Jacob,  the honor of Israel, Because ravagers have ravaged them  and ruined their branches.  The shields of his warriors are crimsoned,  the soldiers clad in scarlet; Like fire are the trappings of the chariots  on the day he prepares for war;  the cavalry is agitated!  The chariots dash madly through the streets  and wheel in the squares, Looking like torches,  bolting like lightning.  His picked troops are called,  ranks break at their charge; To the wall they rush,  their screen   is set up.  The river gates   are opened,  the palace is washed away.  The mistress is led forth captive,  and her maidservants   led away, Moaning like doves,  beating their breasts.  Nineveh is like a pool  whose waters escape; Stop! Stop!  but none turns back.   Plunder the silver, plunder the gold!  There is no end to the treasure,  to wealth in every precious thing!    Emptiness, desolation, waste;  melting hearts and trembling knees, Churning in every stomach,  every face turning pale!   Where is the lionesses den,  the young lions cave, Where the lion   went in and out,  and the cub, with no one to disturb them?   The lion tore apart enough for his cubs,  and strangled for his lionesses; He filled his lairs with prey,  and his dens with torn flesh.  I now come against you\xe2\x80\x94  oracle of the  Lord  of hosts\xe2\x80\x94 I will consume your chariots in smoke,  and the sword will devour your young lions; Your preying on the land I will bring to an end,  the cry of your lionesses will be heard no more.
