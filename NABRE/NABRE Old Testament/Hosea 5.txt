b'  Guilt of the Religious and Political Leaders  Hear this, priests,  Pay attention, house of Israel, Household of the king, give ear!   For you are responsible for judgment.  But you have been a snare at Mizpah,   a net spread upon Tabor,  a pit dug deep in Shittim.  Now I will discipline them all.    I know Ephraim,  and Israel is not hidden from me: Now, Ephraim, you have practiced prostitution,  Israel is defiled.  Their deeds do not allow them  to return to their God;  For the spirit of prostitution is in them,  and they do not know the  Lord .    The arrogance of Israel bears witness against him;  Israel and Ephraim stumble because of their iniquity,  and Judah stumbles with them.  With their flocks and herds they will go  to seek the  Lord , but will not find him;   he has withdrawn from them.  They have betrayed the  Lord ,  for they have borne illegitimate children; Now the new moon   will devour them  together with their fields.   Political Upheavals   Blow the rams horn in Gibeah,  the trumpet in Ramah! Sound the alarm in Beth-aven:   Look behind you, Benjamin!   Ephraim shall become a wasteland  on the day of punishment: Among the tribes of Israel  I announce what is sure to be.  The princes of Judah have become  like those who move a boundary line;   Upon them I will pour out  my wrath like water.  Ephraim is oppressed, crushed by judgment,  for he has willingly gone after filth!   I am like a moth for Ephraim,   like rot for the house of Judah.  When Ephraim saw his infirmity,  and Judah his sore, Ephraim went to Assyria,  and sent to the great king.   But he cannot heal you,  nor take away your sore.  For I am like a lion to Ephraim,  like a young lion to the house of Judah;  It is I who tear the prey and depart,  I carry it away and no one can save it.    Insincere Conversion  I will go back to my place  until they make reparation  and seek my presence. In their affliction, they shall look for me.             '
