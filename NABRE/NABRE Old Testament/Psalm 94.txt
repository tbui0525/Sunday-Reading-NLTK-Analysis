b' A Prayer for Deliverance from the Wicked I  Lord , avenging God,  avenging God, shine forth!   Rise up, O judge of the earth;  give the proud what they deserve!    II  How long,  Lord , shall the wicked,  how long shall the wicked glory?   How long will they mouth haughty speeches,  go on boasting, all these evildoers?   They crush your people,  Lord ,  torment your very own.  They kill the widow and alien;  the orphan they murder.   They say, The  Lord  does not see;  the God of Jacob takes no notice.    III  Understand, you stupid people!  You fools, when will you be wise?   Does the one who shaped the ear not hear?  The one who formed the eye not see?   Does the one who guides nations not rebuke?  The one who teaches man not have knowledge?  The  Lord  knows the plans of man;  they are like a fleeting breath.    IV  Blessed the one whom you guide,  Lord ,   whom you teach by your instruction,  To give rest from evil days,  while a pit is being dug for the wicked.  For the  Lord  will not forsake his people,  nor abandon his inheritance.   Judgment shall again be just,  and all the upright of heart will follow it.   V  Who will rise up for me against the wicked?  Who will stand up for me against evildoers?  If the  Lord  were not my help,  I would long have been silent in the grave.   When I say, My foot is slipping,  your mercy,  Lord , holds me up.   When cares increase within me,  your comfort gives me joy.   VI  Can unjust judges be your allies,  those who create burdens by decree,  Those who conspire against the just  and condemn the innocent to death?  No, the  Lord  is my secure height,  my God, my rock of refuge,   Who will turn back their evil upon them   and destroy them for their wickedness.  Surely the  Lord  our God will destroy them!            '
