b'  Gods Punishment of Sinners   Do not yearn for worthless children,  or rejoice in wicked offspring.  Even if they be many, do not rejoice in them  if they do not have fear of the  Lord .  Do not count on long life for them,   or have any hope for their future. For one can be better than a thousand;  rather die childless than have impious children!  Through one wise person a city can be peopled;  but through a clan of rebels it becomes desolate.    Many such things my eye has seen,  and even more than these my ear has heard.  Against a sinful band fire is kindled,   upon a godless people wrath blazes.   He did not forgive the princes of old   who rebelled long ago in their might.   He did not spare the neighbors of Lot,    abominable in their pride.  He did not spare the doomed people,   dispossessed because of their sin;  Nor the six hundred thousand foot soldiers,    sent to their graves for the arrogance of their hearts.  Had there been but one stiff-necked   person,  it would be a wonder had he gone unpunished. For mercy and anger alike are with him;  he remits and forgives, but also pours out wrath.  Great as his mercy is his punishment;  he judges people, each according to their deeds.  Criminals do not escape with their plunder;  the hope of the righteous, God never leaves unfulfilled.

Among so many people I am unknown;  what am I in the world of spirits?  Look, the heavens and the highest heavens,  the abyss and the earth tremble at his visitation.  The roots of the mountains and the earths foundations\xe2\x80\x94  at his mere glance they quiver and quake.  Of me, therefore, he will take no notice;  with my ways who will be concerned?  If I sin, no eye will see me;  if all in secret I act deceitfully, who is to know?   Who tells him about just deeds?  What can I expect for doing my duty?  Such the thoughts of the senseless;  only the foolish entertain them.   Divine Wisdom Seen in Creation   Listen to me, my son, and take my advice,  and apply your mind to my words,  While I pour out my spirit by measure  and impart knowledge with care.  When at the first God created his works  and, as he made them, assigned their tasks,   He arranged for all time what they were to do,  their domains from generation to generation. They were not to go hungry or grow weary,  or ever cease from their tasks.  Never does a single one crowd its neighbor,  or do any ever disobey his word.  Then the Lord looked upon the earth,  and filled it with his blessings.   Its surface he covered with every kind of living creature  which must return into it again.            '
