b'   These also are proverbs of Solomon.   The servants of Hezekiah,   king of Judah, transmitted them.     It is the glory of God to conceal a matter,  and the glory of kings to fathom a matter.   Like the heavens in height, and the earth in depth,  the heart of kings is unfathomable.   Remove the dross from silver,  and it comes forth perfectly purified;  Remove the wicked from the presence of the king,  and his throne is made firm through justice.   Claim no honor in the kings presence,  nor occupy the place of superiors;  For it is better to be told, Come up closer!  than to be humbled before the prince.   What your eyes have seen  do not bring forth too quickly against an opponent; For what will you do later on  when your neighbor puts you to shame?   Argue your own case with your neighbor,  but the secrets of others do not disclose;  Lest, hearing it, they reproach you,  and your ill repute never ceases.  Golden apples in silver settings  are words spoken at the proper time.  A golden earring or a necklace of fine gold\xe2\x80\x94  one who gives wise reproof to a listening ear.  Like the coolness of snow in the heat of the harvest  are faithful messengers for those who send them,  lifting the spirits of their masters.  Clouds and wind but no rain\xe2\x80\x94  the one who boasts of a gift not given.  By patience is a ruler persuaded,   and a soft tongue can break a bone.   If you find honey, eat only what you need,  lest you have your fill and vomit it up.  Let your foot be seldom in your neighbors house,  lest they have their fill of you\xe2\x80\x94and hate you.  A club, sword, or sharp arrow\xe2\x80\x94  the one who bears false witness against a neighbor.   A bad tooth or an unsteady foot\xe2\x80\x94  a trust betrayed in time of trouble.   Like the removal of clothes on a cold day, or vinegar on soda,  is the one who sings to a troubled heart.   If your enemies are hungry, give them food to eat,  if thirsty, give something to drink;   For live coals you will heap on their heads,  and the  Lord  will vindicate you.  The north wind brings rain,  and a backbiting tongue, angry looks.  It is better to dwell in a corner of the housetop  than in a mansion with a quarrelsome wife.    Cool water to one faint from thirst  is good news from a far country.  A trampled fountain or a polluted spring\xe2\x80\x94   a just person fallen before the wicked.  To eat too much honey is not good;  nor to seek honor after honor.   A city breached and left defenseless  are those who do not control their temper.            '
