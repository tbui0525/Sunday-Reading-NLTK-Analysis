b'  The Altar on Mount Ebal.    Then Moses, with the elders of Israel, commanded the people, saying: Keep this whole commandment which I give you today.     On the day you cross the Jordan into the land which the  Lord , your God, is giving you, set up some large stones and coat them with plaster.     Write on them,   at the time you cross, all the words of this law, so that you may enter the land which the  Lord , your God, is giving you, a land flowing with milk and honey, just as the  Lord , the God of your ancestors, promised you.     When you cross the Jordan, on Mount Ebal you shall set up these stones concerning which I command you today, and coat them with plaster,      and you shall build there an altar to the  Lord , your God, an altar made of stones that no iron tool has touched.     You shall build this altar of the  Lord , your God, with unhewn stones, and shall offer on it burnt offerings to the  Lord , your God.     You shall also offer communion sacrifices   and eat them there, rejoicing in the presence of the  Lord , your God.     On the stones you shall inscribe all the words of this law very clearly.    Moses, with the levitical priests, then said to all Israel: Be silent, Israel, and listen! This day you have become the people of the  Lord , your God.       You shall obey the voice of the  Lord , your God, and keep his commandments and statutes which I am giving you today.   Preparation for Blessings and Curses.
