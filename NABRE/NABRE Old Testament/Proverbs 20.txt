b'   Wine is arrogant, strong drink is riotous;  none who are intoxicated by them are wise.    The terror of a king is like the roar of a lion;   those who incur his anger forfeit their lives.  A person gains honor by avoiding strife,  while every fool starts a quarrel.   In seedtime sluggards do not plow;  when they look for the harvest, it is not there.  The intention of the human heart is deep water,  but the intelligent draw it forth.    Many say, My loyal friend,  but who can find someone worthy of trust?  The just walk in integrity;  happy are their children after them!  A king seated on the throne of judgment  dispels all evil with his glance.   Who can say, I have made my heart clean,   I am cleansed of my sin?   Varying weights, varying measures,  are both an abomination to the  Lord .
