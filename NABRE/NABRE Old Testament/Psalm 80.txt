b' Prayer to Restore Gods Vineyard  For the leader; according to Lilies.  Eduth .   A psalm of Asaph.   I  O Shepherd of Israel, lend an ear,  you who guide Joseph like a flock! Seated upon the cherubim, shine forth    upon Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasseh. Stir up your power, and come to save us.    O God, restore us;  light up your face and we shall be saved.   II  Lord  of hosts,  how long will you smolder in anger  while your people pray?   You have fed them the bread of tears,  made them drink tears in great measure.    You have left us to be fought over by our neighbors;  our enemies deride us.   O God of hosts, restore us;  light up your face and we shall be saved.   III  You brought a vine   out of Egypt;  you drove out nations and planted it.  You cleared out what was before it;  it took deep root and filled the land.  The mountains were covered by its shadow,  the cedars of God by its branches.  It sent out its boughs as far as the sea,   its shoots as far as the river.  Why have you broken down its walls,  so that all who pass along the way pluck its fruit?   The boar from the forest strips the vine;  the beast of the field feeds upon it.   Turn back again, God of hosts;  look down from heaven and see; Visit this vine,   the stock your right hand has planted,  and the son   whom you made strong for yourself.  Those who would burn or cut it down\xe2\x80\x94  may they perish at your rebuke.  May your hand be with the man on your right,   with the son of man whom you made strong for yourself.  Then we will not withdraw from you;  revive us, and we will call on your name.  Lord  God of hosts, restore us;  light up your face and we shall be saved.            '
