b'  Against the Mountains of Israel.    The word of the  Lord  came to me:     Son of man, set your face toward the mountains of Israel and prophesy against them:       You shall say: Mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord  God . Thus says the Lord  God  to the mountains and hills, to the ravines and valleys:   Pay attention! I am bringing a sword against you, and I will destroy your high places.       Your altars shall be laid waste, your incense stands smashed, and I will throw your slain down in front of your idols.     Yes, I will lay the corpses of the Israelites in front of their idols, and scatter your bones around your altars.        Wherever you live, cities shall be ruined and high places laid waste, in order that your altars be laid waste and devastated, your idols broken and smashed, your incense altars hacked to pieces, and whatever you have made wiped out.       The slain shall fall in your midst, and you shall know that I am the  Lord .        But I will spare some of you from the sword to live as refugees among the nations when you are scattered to foreign lands.     Then your refugees will remember me among the nations to which they have been exiled, after I have broken their lusting hearts that turned away from me and their eyes that lusted after idols. They will loathe themselves for all the evil they have done, for all their abominations.       Then they shall know that I the  Lord  did not threaten in vain to inflict this evil on them.    Thus says the Lord  God : Clap your hands, stamp your feet,   and cry Alas! for all the evil abominations of the house of Israel! They shall fall by the sword, starvation, and disease.       Those far off shall die of disease, those nearby shall fall by the sword, and those who survive and are spared shall perish by starvation; thus will I spend my fury upon them.     They shall know that I am the  Lord , when their slain lie among their idols, all around their altars, on every high hill and mountaintop, beneath every green tree and leafy oak  \xe2\x80\x94any place they offer sweet-smelling oblations to all their idols.       I will stretch out my hand against them; I will make the land a desolate waste, from the wilderness to Riblah,   wherever they live. Thus they shall know that I am the  Lord .             '
