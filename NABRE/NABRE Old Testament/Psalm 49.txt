b' Confidence in God Rather than in Riches  For the leader. A psalm of the Korahites.     Hear this, all you peoples!  Give ear, all who inhabit the world,  You of lowly birth or high estate,  rich and poor together.  My mouth shall speak words of wisdom,  my heart shall offer insights.   I will turn my ear to a riddle,   expound my question on a lyre.   I  Why should I fear in evil days,  with the iniquity of my assailants surrounding me,  Of those who trust in their wealth  and boast of their abundant riches?    No man can ransom even a brother,  or pay to God his own ransom.   The redemption of his soul is costly;  and he will pass away forever.  Will he live on forever, then,  and never see the Pit of Corruption?  Indeed, he will see that the wise die,  and the fool will perish together with the senseless,   and they leave their wealth to others.   Their tombs are their homes forever,  their dwellings through all generations,  They named countries after themselves   \xe2\x80\x94but man does not abide in splendor.  He is like the beasts\xe2\x80\x94they perish.    II  This is the way of those who trust in themselves,  and the end of those who take pleasure in their own mouth. Selah  Like a herd of sheep they will be put into Sheol,  and Death will shepherd them. Straight to the grave they descend,  where their form will waste away,  Sheol will be their palace.  But God will redeem my life,  will take me   from the hand of Sheol.  Selah  Do not fear when a man becomes rich,  when the wealth of his house grows great.  At his death he will not take along anything,  his glory will not go down after him.   During his life his soul uttered blessings;  They will praise you, for you do well for yourself.  But he will join the company of his fathers,  never again to see the light.   In his prime, man does not understand.  He is like the beasts\xe2\x80\x94they perish.            '
