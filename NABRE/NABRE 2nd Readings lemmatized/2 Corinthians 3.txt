b '      be we begin to commend ourselves again ? or do we need , as some do , letter of recommendation to you or from you ?      you be our letter ,    write on our heart , know and read by all ,        show to be a letter of Christ administer by we , write not in ink but by the Spirit of the live God , not on tablet of stone but on tablet that be heart of flesh .      such confidence we have through Christ toward God .      not that of ourselves we be qualified to take credit for anything as come from we ; rather , our qualification come from God ,        who have indeed qualify we as minister of a new covenant , not of letter but of spirit ;    for the letter bring death , but the Spirit give life .     Contrast with the Old Covenant .      now if the ministry of death ,    carve in letter on stone , be so glorious that the Israelites could not look intently at the face of Moses because of its glory that be go to fade ,        how much more    will the ministry of the Spirit be glorious ?      for if the ministry of condemnation be glorious , the ministry of righteousness will abound much more in glory .      indeed , what be endow with glory have come to have no glory in this respect because of the glory that surpass it .      for if what be go to fade be glorious , how much more will what endure be glorious .     therefore , since we have such hope ,    we act very boldly      and not like Moses ,    who put a veil over his face so that the Israelites could not look intently at the cessation of what be fade .      rather , their thought be render dull , for to this present day    the same veil remain unlifted when they read the old covenant , because through Christ it be take away .      to this day , in fact , whenever Moses be read , a veil lie over their heart ,        but whenever a person turn to the Lord the veil be remove .        now the Lord be the Spirit ,    and where the Spirit of the Lord be , there be freedom .       all of we , gaze with unveil face on the glory of the Lord , be be transform into the same image from glory to glory , as from the Lord who be the Spirit .
