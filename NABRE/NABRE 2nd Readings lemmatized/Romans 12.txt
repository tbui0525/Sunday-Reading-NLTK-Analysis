b '   Sacrifice of body and mind .      I urge you therefore , brother , by the mercy of God , to offer your body as a living sacrifice , holy and pleasing to God , your spiritual worship .        do not conform yourself to this age but be transform by the renewal of your mind , that you may discern what be the will of God , what be good and pleasing and perfect .     many Parts in one body .      for by the grace give to I I tell everyone among you not to think of himself more highly than one ought to think , but to think soberly , each accord to the measure of faith that God have apportion .       for as in one body we have many part , and all the part do not have the same function ,      so we , though many , be one body in Christ    and individually part of one another .       since we have gift that differ accord to the grace give to we , let we exercise they :    if prophecy , in proportion to the faith ;      if ministry , in minister ; if one be a teacher , in teaching ;      if one exhort , in exhortation ; if one contribute , in generosity ; if one be over other ,    with diligence ; if one do act of mercy , with cheerfulness .    Mutual Love .     let love be sincere ; hate what be evil , hold on to what be good ;        love one another with mutual affection ; anticipate one another in show honor .        do not grow slack in zeal , be fervent in spirit , serve the Lord .        rejoice in hope , endure in affliction , persevere in prayer .        contribute to the need of the holy one ,    exercise hospitality .       bless those who persecute [ you ] ,    bless and do not curse they .        rejoice with those who rejoice , weep with those who weep .        have the same regard for one another ; do not be haughty but associate with the lowly ; do not be wise in your own estimation .        do not repay anyone evil for evil ; be concern for what be noble in the sight of all .        if possible , on your part , live at peace with all .        beloved , do not look for revenge but leave room for the wrath ; for it be write , Vengeance be mine , I will repay , say the Lord .        rather , if your enemy be hungry , feed he ; if he be thirsty , give he something to drink ; for by so do you will heap burn coal upon his head .        do not be conquer by evil but conquer evil with good .
