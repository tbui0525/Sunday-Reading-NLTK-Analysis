b '    for I decide not to come to you again in painful circumstance .      for if I inflict pain upon you , then who be there to cheer I except the one pain by I ?      and I write as I do    so that when I come I might not be pain by those in whom I should have rejoice , confident about all of you that my joy be that of all of you .      for out of much affliction and anguish of heart I write to you with many tear , not that you might be pain but that you might know the abundant love I have for you . the offender .        if anyone have cause pain , he have cause it not to I , but in some measure ( not to exaggerate ) to all of you .      this punishment by the majority be enough for such a person ,      so that on the contrary you should forgive and encourage he instead , or else the person may be overwhelm by excessive pain .        therefore , I urge you to reaffirm your love for he .      for this be why I write , to know your proven character , whether you be obedient in everything .        whomever you forgive anything , so do i. for indeed what I have forgive , if I have forgive anything , have be for you in the presence of Christ ,      so that we might not be take advantage of by Satan , for we be not unaware of his purpose .   Pauls Anxiety .        when I go to Troas for the gospel of Christ , although a door be open for I in the Lord ,         I have no relief in my spirit because I do not find my brother Titus .    so I take leave of they and go on to Macedonia .
