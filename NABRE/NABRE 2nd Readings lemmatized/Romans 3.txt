b '   answer to objection .      what advantage be there then in be a Jew ? or what be the value of circumcision ?      much , in every respect . [ for ] in the first place , they be entrust with the utterance of God .        what if some be unfaithful ? will their infidelity nullify the fidelity of God ?        of course not ! God must be true , though every human being be a liar ,    as it be write : that you may be justify in your word ,   and conquer when you be judge .      but if our wickedness provide proof of Gods righteousness , what can we say ? be God unjust , humanly speak , to inflict his wrath ?        of course not ! for how else be God to judge the world ?      but if Gods truth redound to his glory through my falsehood , why be I still be condemn as a sinner ?      and why not say\xe2\x80\x94as we be accuse and as some claim we say\xe2\x80\x94that we should do evil that good may come of it ? their penalty be what they deserve .   Universal Bondage to sin .        well , then , be we well off ? not entirely , for we have already bring the charge against Jews and Greeks alike that they be all under the domination of sin ,        as it be write :   there be no one just , not one ,    there be no one who understand ,   there be no one who seek God .   all have go astray ; all alike be worthless ;   there be not one who do good ,   [ there be not ] even one .   their throat be open grave ;   they deceive with their tongue ; the venom of asp be on their lip ;     their mouth be full of bitter cursing .    their foot be quick to shed blood ;     ruin and misery be in their way ,   and the way of peace they know not .    there be no fear of God before their eye .      now we know that what the law    say be address to those under the law , so that every mouth may be silence and the whole world stand accountable to God ,        since no human being will be justify in his sight    by observe the law ; for through the law come consciousness of sin .    Justification apart from the Law .        but now    the righteousness of God have be manifest apart from the law , though testify to by the law and the prophet ,        the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all who believe . for there be no distinction ;        all have sin and be deprive of the glory of God .        they be justify freely by his grace through the redemption in Christ Jesus ,        whom God set forth as an expiation ,    through faith , by his blood , to prove his righteousness because of the forgiveness of sin previously commit ,        through the forbearance of God\xe2\x80\x94to prove his righteousness in the present time , that he might be righteous and justify the one who have faith in Jesus .      what occasion be there then for boast ?    it be rule out . on what principle , that of work ? no , rather on the principle of faith .        for we consider that a person be justify by faith apart from work of the law .        do God belong to Jews alone ? do he not belong to Gentiles , too ? yes , also to Gentiles ,        for God be one and will justify the circumcise on the basis of faith and the uncircumcised through faith .        be we then annul the law by this faith ? of course not !    on the contrary , we be support the law .
