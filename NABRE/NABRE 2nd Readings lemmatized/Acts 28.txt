b '   Winter in Malta .     once we have reach safety we learn that the island be call Malta .      the native show we extraordinary hospitality ; they light a fire and welcome all of we because it have begin to rain and be cold .      Paul have gather a bundle of brushwood and be put it on the fire when a viper , escape from the heat , fasten on his hand .      when the native see the snake hang from his hand , they say to one another , this man must certainly be a murderer ; though he escape the sea , Justice    have not let he remain alive .      but he shake the snake off into the fire and suffer no harm .      they be expect he to swell up or suddenly to fall down dead but , after wait a long time and see nothing unusual happen to he , they change their mind and begin to say that he be a god .        in the vicinity of that place be land belong to a man name Publius , the chief of the island . he welcome we and receive we cordially as his guest for three day .      it so happen that the father of Publius be sick with a fever and dysentery . Paul visit he and , after pray , lay his hand on he and heal he .      after this have take place , the rest of the sick on the island come to Paul and be cure .      they pay we great honor and when we eventually set sail they bring we the provision we need .    Arrival in Rome .     three month later we set sail on a ship that have winter at the island . it be an Alexandrian ship with the Dioscuri    as its figurehead .      we put in at Syracuse and stay there three day ,      and from there we sail round the coast and arrive at Rhegium . after a day , a south wind come up and in two day we reach Puteoli .      there we find some brother and be urge to stay with they for seven day . and thus we come to Rome .      the brother from there hear about we and come as far as the Forum of Appius and three tavern to meet we . on see they , Paul give thank to God and take courage .      when he enter Rome ,    Paul be allow to live by himself , with the soldier who be guard he .    testimony to Jews in Rome .      three day later he call together the leader of the Jews . when they have gather he say to they , my brother , although I have do nothing against our people or our ancestral custom , I be hand over to the Romans as a prisoner from Jerusalem .        after try my case the Romans want to release I , because they find nothing against I deserve the death penalty .        but when the Jews object , I be oblige to appeal to Caesar , even though I have no accusation to make against my own nation .        this be the reason , then , I have request to see you and to speak with you , for it be on account of the hope of Israel    that I wear these chain .        they answer he , we have receive no letter from Judea about you , nor have any of the brother arrive with a damaging report or rumor about you .      but we should like to hear you present your view , for we know that this sect be denounce everywhere .      so they arrange a day with he and come to his lodging in great number . from early morning until evening , he expound his position to they , bear witness to the kingdom of God and try to convince they about Jesus from the law of Moses and the prophet .      some be convince by what he have say , while other do not believe .       without reach any agreement among themselves they begin to leave ; then Paul make one final statement . well do the holy Spirit speak to your ancestor through the prophet Isaiah , say :     go to this people and say :   you shall indeed hear but not understand .   you shall indeed look but never see .   Gross be the heart of this people ;   they will not hear with their ear ;   they have close their eye ,   so they may not see with their eye   and hear with their ear and understand with their heart and be convert ,   and I heal they .      let it be know to you that this salvation of God have be send to the Gentiles ; they will listen .     [   ]       he remain for two full year in his lodging . he receive all who come to he ,      and with complete assurance and without hindrance he proclaim the kingdom of God and teach about the Lord Jesus Christ .
