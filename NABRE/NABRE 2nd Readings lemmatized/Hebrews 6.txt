b '    therefore , let we leave behind the basic teaching about Christ and advance to maturity , without lay the foundation all over again : repentance from dead work and faith in God ,        instruction about baptism    and lay on of hand , resurrection of the dead and eternal judgment .        and we shall do this , if only God permit .      for it be impossible in the case of those who have once be enlighten and taste the heavenly gift    and share in the holy Spirit        and taste the good word of God and the power of the age to come ,        and then have fall away , to bring they to repentance again , since they be recrucifye the Son of God for themselves    and hold he up to contempt .        ground that have absorb the rain fall upon it repeatedly and bring forth crop useful to those for whom it be cultivate receive a blessing from God .        but if it produce thorn and thistle , it be reject ; it will soon be curse and finally burn .      but we be sure in your regard , beloved , of well thing relate to salvation , even though we speak in this way .      for God be not unjust so as to overlook your work and the love you have demonstrate for his name by having serve and continue to serve the holy one .      we earnestly desire each of you to demonstrate the same eagerness for the fulfillment of hope until the end ,        so that you may not become sluggish , but imitator of those who , through faith and patience ,    be inherit the promise .     Gods promise immutable .       when God make the promise to Abraham , since he have no one great by whom to swear , he swear by himself ,      and say , I will indeed bless you and multiply you .        and so , after patient waiting ,    he obtain the promise .        human being swear by someone great than themselves ; for they an oath serve as a guarantee and put an end to all argument .      so when God want to give the heir of his promise an even clear demonstration of the immutability of his purpose , he intervene with an oath ,        so that by two immutable thing ,    in which it be impossible for God to lie , we who have take refuge might be strongly encourage to hold fast to the hope that lie before we .        this we have as an anchor of the soul ,    sure and firm , which reach into the interior behind the veil ,        where Jesus have enter on our behalf as forerunner , become high priest forever accord to the order of Melchizedek .
