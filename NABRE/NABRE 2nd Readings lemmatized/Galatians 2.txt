b '   the Council of Jerusalem .      then after fourteen year I again go up to Jerusalem with Barnabas ,    take Titus along also .        I go up in accord with a revelation ,    and I present to they the gospel that I preach to the gentiles\xe2\x80\x94but privately to those of repute\xe2\x80\x94so that I might not be run , or have run , in vain .        moreover , not even    Titus , who be with I , although he be a Greek , be compel to be circumcise ,        but because of the false brother    secretly bring in , who slip in to spy on our freedom that we have in Christ Jesus ,    that they might enslave us\xe2\x80\x94      to they we do not submit even for a moment , so that the truth of the gospel    might remain intact for you .        but from those who be repute to be important ( what they once be make no difference to I ; God show no partiality)\xe2\x80\x94those of repute make I add nothing .         on the contrary , when they see that I have be entrust with the gospel to the uncircumcised , just as Peter to the circumcise ,        for the one who work in Peter for an apostolate to the circumcise work also in I for the Gentiles ,      and when they recognize the grace bestow upon I , James and Cephas and John ,    who be repute to be pillar , give I and Barnabas their right hand in partnership , that we should go to the Gentiles and they to the circumcise .        only , we be to be mindful of the poor ,    which be the very thing I be eager to do .   Peters Inconsistency at Antioch .         and when Cephas come to Antioch , I oppose he to his face because he clearly be wrong .        for , until some people come from James ,    he use to eat with the Gentiles ; but when they come , he begin to draw back and separate himself , because he be afraid of the circumcise .        and the rest of the Jews    [ also ] act hypocritically along with he , with the result that even Barnabas be carry away by their hypocrisy .        but when I see that they be not on the right road in line with the truth of the gospel , I say to Cephas in front of all ,    if you , though a Jew , be live like a gentile and not like a Jew , how can you compel the Gentiles to live like Jews ?   Faith and Works .        we , who be Jews by nature and not sinner from among the Gentiles ,       [ yet ] who know that a person be not justify by work of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ , even we have believe in Christ Jesus that we may be justify by faith in Christ and not by work of the law , because by work of the law no one will be justify .        but if , in seek to be justify in Christ , we ourselves be find to be sinner , be Christ then a minister of sin ?    of course not !      but if I be build up again those thing that I tear down , then I show myself to be a transgressor .        for through the law I die to the law ,    that I might live for God . I have be crucify with Christ ;        yet I live , no long I , but Christ live in I ; insofar as I now live in the flesh , I live by faith in the Son of God who have love I and give himself up for I .        I do not nullify the grace of God ; for if justification come through the law , then Christ die for nothing .              '
