b '     now there be in the church at Antioch prophet and teacher : Barnabas , Symeon who be call Niger , Lucius of Cyrene , Manaen who be a close friend of Herod the tetrarch , and Saul .      while they be worship the Lord and fast , the holy Spirit say , set apart for I Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have call they .      then , complete their fasting and prayer , they lay hand on they and send they off .    First Mission begin in Cyprus .      so they , send forth by the holy Spirit , go down to Seleucia and from there sail to Cyprus .      when they arrive in Salamis , they proclaim the word of God in the jewish synagogue . they have John    also as their assistant .      when they have travel through the whole island as far as Paphos , they meet a magician name Bar - Jesus who be a jewish false prophet .        he be with the proconsul Sergius Paulus , a man of intelligence , who have summon Barnabas and Saul and want to hear the word of God .      but Elymas the magician ( for that be what his name mean ) oppose they in an attempt to turn the proconsul away from the faith .      but Saul , also know as Paul ,    fill with the holy Spirit , look intently at he      and say , you son of the devil , you enemy of all that be right , full of every sort of deceit and fraud . will you not stop twist the straight path of [ the ] Lord ?      even now the hand of the Lord be upon you . you will be blind , and unable to see the sun for a time . immediately a dark mist fall upon he , and he go about seek people to lead he by the hand .      when the proconsul see what have happen , he come to believe , for he be astonish by the teaching about the Lord .    Pauls Arrival at Antioch in Pisidia .     from Paphos , Paul and his companion set sail and arrive at Perga in Pamphylia . but John leave they and return to Jerusalem .        they continue on from Perga and reach Antioch in Pisidia . on the sabbath they enter [ into ] the synagogue and take their seat .      after the reading of the law and the prophet , the synagogue official send word to they , my brother , if one of you have a word of exhortation for the people , please speak .    Pauls Address in the Synagogue .      so Paul get up , motion with his hand , and say , Fellow Israelites and you other who be God - fear ,    listen .      the God of this people Israel choose our ancestor and exalt the people during their sojourn in the land of Egypt .    with uplifted arm he lead they out of it      and for about forty year he put up with    they in the desert .        when he have destroy seven nation in the land of Canaan , he give they their land as an inheritance        at the end of about four hundred and fifty year .    after these thing he provide judge up to Samuel [ the ] prophet .        then they ask for a king . God give they Saul , son of Kish , a man from the tribe of Benjamin , for forty year .        then he remove he and raise up David as their king ; of he he testify , I have find David , son of Jesse , a man after my own heart ; he will carry out my every wish .        from this mans descendant God , accord to his promise , have bring to Israel a savior , Jesus .        John herald his come by proclaim a baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel ;        and as John be complete his course , he would say , what do you suppose that I be ? I be not he . behold , one be come after I ; I be not worthy to unfasten the sandal of his foot .      my brother , child of the family of Abraham , and those other among you who be God - fear , to we this word of salvation have be send .      the inhabitant of Jerusalem and their leader fail to recognize he , and by condemn he they fulfil the oracle of the prophet that be read sabbath after sabbath .      for even though they find no ground for a death sentence , they ask Pilate to have he put to death ,        and when they have accomplish all that be write about he , they take he down from the tree and place he in a tomb .        but God raise he from the dead ,        and for many day he appear to those who have come up with he from Galilee to Jerusalem .    these be [ now ] his witness before the people .        we ourselves be proclaim this good news to you that what God promise our ancestor      he have bring to fulfillment for we , [ their ] child , by raise up Jesus , as it be write in the second psalm , you be my son ; this day I have beget you .        and that he raise he from the dead never to return to corruption he declare in this way , I shall give you the benefit assure to David .        that be why he also say in another psalm , you will not suffer your holy one to see corruption .        now David , after he have serve the will of God in his lifetime , fall asleep , be gather to his ancestor , and do see corruption .        but the one whom God raise up do not see corruption .      you must know , my brother , that through he forgiveness of sin be be proclaim to you , [ and ] in regard to everything from which you could not be justify    under the law of Moses ,      in he every believer be justify .        be careful , then , that what be say in the prophet not come about :     look on , you scoffer ,   be amazed and disappear . for I be do a work in your day ,   a work that you will never believe   even if someone tell you .      as they be leave , they invite they to speak on these subject the follow sabbath .      after the congregation have disperse , many Jews and worshiper who be convert to Judaism follow Paul and Barnabas , who speak to they and urge they to remain faithful to the grace of God .    address to the Gentiles .     on the follow sabbath almost the whole city gather to hear the word of the Lord .      when the Jews see the crowd , they be fill with jealousy and with violent abuse contradict what Paul say .       both Paul and Barnabas speak out boldly and say , it be necessary that the word of God be speak to you first , but since you reject it and condemn yourself as unworthy of eternal life , we now turn to the Gentiles .        for so the Lord have command we , I have make you a light to the Gentiles , that you may be an instrument of salvation to the end of the earth .      the Gentiles be delighted when they hear this and glorify the word of the Lord . all who be destine for eternal life come to believe ,      and the word of the Lord continue to spread through the whole region .      the Jews , however , incite the woman of prominence who be worshiper and the lead man of the city , stir up a persecution against Paul and Barnabas , and expel they from their territory .       so they shake the dust from their foot in protest against they and go to Iconium .        the disciple be fill with joy and the holy Spirit .
