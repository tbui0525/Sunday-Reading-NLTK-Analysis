b '    Prayer and Conduct .      first of all , then , I ask that supplication , prayer , petition , and thanksgiving be offer for everyone ,        for king and for all in authority , that we may lead a quiet and tranquil life in all devotion and dignity .      this be good and pleasing to God our savior ,        who will everyone to be save and to come to knowledge of the truth .      for there be one God . there be also one mediator between God and the human race , Christ Jesus , himself human ,    who give himself as ransom for all . this be the testimony    at the proper time .        for this I be appoint preacher and apostle ( I be speak the truth , I be not lie ) , teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth .       it be my wish , then , that in every place the man should pray , lift up holy hand , without anger or argument .      similarly , [ too , ] woman should adorn themselves with proper conduct , with modesty and self - control , not with braid hairstyle and gold ornament , or pearl , or expensive clothe ,        but rather , as befits woman who profess reverence for God , with good deed .        a woman must receive instruction silently and under complete control .        I do not permit a woman to teach or to have authority over a man .    she must be quiet .      for Adam be form first , then Eve .        far , Adam be not deceive , but the woman be deceive and transgress .        but she will be save through motherhood , provide woman persevere in faith and love and holiness , with self - control .
