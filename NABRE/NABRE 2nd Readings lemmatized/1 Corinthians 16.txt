b '    the Collection .      now in regard to the collection    for the holy one , you also should do as I order the church of Galatia .        on the first day of the week each of you should set aside and save whatever he can afford , so that collection will not be go on when I come .      and when I arrive , I shall send those whom you have approve with letter of recommendation to take your gracious gift to Jerusalem .      if it seem fitting that I should go also ,    they will go with I . Pauls Travel Plans .        I shall come to you after I pass through Macedonia ( for I be go to pass through Macedonia ) ,        and perhaps I shall stay or even spend the winter with you , so that you may send I on my way wherever I may go .      for I do not wish to see you now just in pass , but I hope to spend some time with you , if the Lord permit .         I shall stay in Ephesus    until Pentecost ,      because a door have open for I wide and productive for work , but there be many opponent .      if Timothy come , see that he be without fear in your company , for he be do the work of the Lord just as I be .        therefore , no one should disdain he . rather , send he on his way in peace that he may come to I , for I be expect he with the brother .      now in regard to our brother Apollos , I urge he strongly to go to you with the brother , but it be not at all his will that he go now . he will go when he have an opportunity .
