b '   plea for Unity and Humility .      if there be any encouragement in Christ , any solace in love , any participation in the Spirit , any compassion and mercy ,      complete my joy by be of the same mind , with the same love , unite in heart , think one thing .        do nothing out of selfishness or out of vainglory ; rather , humbly regard other as more important than yourself ,        each look out not for his own interest , but [ also ] everyone for those of other .      have among yourself the same attitude that be also yours in Christ Jesus ,      who ,    though he be in the form of God ,    do not regard equality with God something to be grasp .     rather , he empty himself ,   take the form of a slave ,   come in human likeness ;    and find human in appearance ,     he humble himself ,    become obedient to death ,   even death on a cross .    because of this , God greatly exalt he   and bestow on he the name    that be above every name ,     that at the name of Jesus   every knee should bend ,    of those in heaven and on earth and under the earth ,     and every tongue confess that   Jesus Christ be Lord ,    to the glory of God the Father .   obedience and Service in the World .         so then , my beloved , obedient as you have always be , not only when I be present but all the more now when I be absent , work out your salvation with fear and trembling .        for God be the one who , for his good purpose , work in you both to desire and to work .        do everything without grumble or questioning ,        that you may be blameless and innocent , child of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation ,    among whom you shine like light in the world ,        as you hold on to the word of life , so that my boast for the day of Christ may be that I do not run in vain or labor in vain .        but , even if I be pour out as a libation    upon the sacrificial service of your faith , I rejoice and share my joy with all of you .        in the same way you also should rejoice and share your joy with I .     Timothy and Paul .     I hope , in the Lord Jesus , to send Timothy    to you soon , so that I too may be hearten by hear news of you .        for I have no one comparable to he for genuine interest in whatever concern you .      for they all seek their own interest , not those of Jesus Christ .        but you know his worth , how as a child with a father he serve along with I in the cause of the gospel .      he it be , then , whom I hope to send as soon as I see how thing go with I ,      but I be confident in the Lord that I myself will also come soon .     Epaphroditus .     with regard to Epaphroditus ,    my brother and co - worker and fellow soldier , your messenger and minister in my need , I consider it necessary to send he to you .        for he have be long for all of you and be distressed because you hear that he be ill .      he be indeed ill , close to death ; but God have mercy on he , not just on he but also on I , so that I might not have sorrow upon sorrow .      I send he therefore with the great eagerness , so that , on see he , you may rejoice again , and I may have less anxiety .      welcome he then in the Lord with all joy and hold such people in esteem ,        because for the sake of the work of Christ he come close to death , risk his life to make up for those service to I that you could not perform .
