b '   to Ephesus .      to the angel of the church    in Ephesus ,    write this : the one who hold the seven star in his right hand and walk in the midst of the seven gold lampstand say this :      I know your work , your labor , and your endurance , and that you can not tolerate the wicked ; you have test those who call themselves apostle but be not , and discover that they be impostor .        moreover , you have endurance and have suffer for my name , and you have not grow weary .      yet I hold this against you : you have lose the love you have at first .      realize how far you have fall . repent , and do the work you do at first . otherwise , I will come to you and remove your lampstand from its place , unless you repent .      but you have this in your favor : you hate the work of the Nicolaitans ,    which I also hate .     whoever have ear ought to hear what the Spirit say to the church . to the victor    I will give the right to eat from the tree of life that be in the garden of God .   to Smyrna .        to the angel of the church in Smyrna ,    write this : the first and the last , who once die but come to life , say this :      I know your tribulation and poverty , but you be rich .    I know the slander of those who claim to be Jews and be not , but rather be member of the assembly of Satan .        do not be afraid of anything that you be go to suffer . indeed , the devil will throw some of you into prison , that you may be test , and you will face an ordeal for ten day . remain faithful until death , and I will give you the crown of life .     whoever have ear ought to hear what the Spirit say to the church .    the victor shall not be harm by the second death .   to Pergamum .        to the angel of the church in Pergamum ,    write this : the one with the sharp two - edge sword say this :      I know that you live where Satans throne    be , and yet you hold fast to my name and have not deny your faith in I , not even in the day of Antipas , my faithful witness , who be martyr among you , where Satan live .       yet I have a few thing against you . you have some people there who hold to the teaching of Balaam , who instruct Balak to put a stumble block before the Israelites : to eat food sacrifice to idol and to play the harlot .        likewise , you also have some people who hold to the teaching of [ the ] Nicolaitans .      therefore , repent . otherwise , I will come to you quickly and wage war against they with the sword of my mouth .     whoever have ear ought to hear what the Spirit say to the church . to the victor I shall give some of the hide manna ;    I shall also give a white amulet upon which be inscribe a new name , which no one know except the one who receive it .   to Thyatira .        to the angel of the church in Thyatira ,    write this : the Son of God , whose eye be like a fiery flame and whose foot be like polished brass , say this :      I know your work , your love , faith , service , and endurance , and that your last work be great than the first .      yet I hold this against you , that you tolerate the woman Jezebel , who call herself a prophetess , who teach and mislead my servant to play the harlot and to eat food sacrifice to idol .        I have give her time to repent , but she refuse to repent of her harlotry .      so I will cast she on a sickbed and plunge those who commit adultery with she into intense suffering unless they repent of her work .      I will also put her child    to death . thus shall all the church come to know that I be the searcher of heart and mind and that I will give each of you what your work deserve .        but I say to the rest of you in Thyatira , who do not uphold this teaching and know nothing of the so - call deep secret of Satan :    on you I will place no further burden ,      except that you must hold fast to what you have until I come .     to the victor ,    who keep to my way    until the end ,   I will give authority over the nation .    he will rule they with an iron rod .   like clay vessel will they be smash ,     just as I receive authority from my Father . and to he I will give the morning star .     whoever have ear ought to hear what the Spirit say to the church .
