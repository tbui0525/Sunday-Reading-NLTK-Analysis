b '   Faith , Hope , and Love .      therefore , since we have be justify by faith , we have peace    with God through our Lord Jesus Christ ,        through whom we have gain access [ by faith ] to this grace in which we stand , and we boast in hope of the glory of God .        not only that , but we even boast of our affliction , know that affliction produce endurance ,      and endurance , prove character , and prove character , hope ,        and hope do not disappoint , because the love of God have be pour out into our heart through the holy Spirit that have be give to we .        for Christ , while we be still helpless , yet die at the appoint time for the ungodly .      indeed , only with difficulty do one die for a just person , though perhaps for a good person one might even find courage to die .        but God prove his love for we in that while we be still sinner Christ die for we .        how much more then , since we be now justify by his blood , will we be save through he from the wrath .        indeed , if , while we be enemy , we be reconcile to God through the death of his Son , how much more , once reconcile , will we be save by his life .        not only that , but we also boast of God through our Lord Jesus Christ , through whom we have now receive reconciliation .    Humanitys Sin through Adam .      therefore , just as through one person sin enter the world ,    and through sin , death , and thus death come to all , inasmuch as all sin   \xe2\x80\x94      for up to the time of the law , sin be in the world , though sin be not account when there be no law .        but death reign from Adam to Moses , even over those who do not sin after the pattern of the trespass of Adam , who be the type of the one who be to come .     Grace and life through Christ .     but the gift be not like the transgression . for if by that one person transgression the many die , how much more do the grace of God and the gracious gift of the one person Jesus Christ overflow for the many .      and the gift be not like the result of the one person sin . for after one sin there be the judgment that bring condemnation ; but the gift , after many transgression , bring acquittal .      for if , by the transgression of one person , death come to reign through that one , how much more will those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of justification come to reign in life through the one person Jesus Christ .      in conclusion , just as through one transgression condemnation come upon all , so through one righteous act acquittal and life come to all .        for just as through the disobedience of one person the many be make sinner , so through the obedience of one the many will be make righteous .        the law enter in    so that transgression might increase but , where sin increase , grace overflow all the more ,        so that , as sin reign in death , grace also might reign through justification for eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord .
