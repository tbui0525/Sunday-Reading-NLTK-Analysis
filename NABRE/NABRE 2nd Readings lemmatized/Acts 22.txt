b '   Pauls Defense before the Jerusalem Jews .      my brother and father , listen to what I be about to say to you in my defense .      when they hear he address they in Hebrew they become all the more quiet . and he continue ,      I be a Jew , bear in Tarsus in Cilicia , but bring up in this city . at the foot of Gamaliel I be educate strictly in our ancestral law and be zealous for God , just as all of you be today .        I persecute this way to death , bind both man and woman and deliver they to prison .        even the high priest and the whole council of elder can testify on my behalf . for from they I even receive letter to the brother and set out for Damascus to bring back to Jerusalem in chain for punishment those there as well .     on that journey as I draw near to Damascus , about noon a great light from the sky suddenly shine around I .        I fall to the ground and hear a voice say to I , Saul , Saul , why be you persecute I ?        I reply , who be you , sir ? and he say to I , I be Jesus the Nazorean whom you be persecute .        my companion see the light but do not hear the voice of the one who speak to I .        I ask , what shall I do , sir ? the Lord answer I , get up and go into Damascus , and there you will be tell about everything appoint for you to do .        since I could see nothing because of the brightness of that light , I be lead by hand by my companion and enter Damascus .       a certain Ananias , a devout observer of the law , and highly speak of by all the Jews who live there ,      come to I and stand there and say , Saul , my brother , regain your sight . and at that very moment I regain my sight and see he .      then he say , the God of our ancestor designate you to know his will , to see the Righteous One , and to hear the sound of his voice ;      for you will be his witness    before all to what you have see and hear .      now , why delay ? get up and have yourself baptize and your sin wash away , call upon his name .     after I have return to Jerusalem and while I be pray in the temple , I fall into a trance      and see the Lord say to I , hurry , leave Jerusalem at once , because they will not accept your testimony about I .      but I reply , Lord , they themselves know that from synagogue to synagogue I use to imprison and beat those who believe in you .        and when the blood of your witness Stephen be be shed , I myself stand by give my approval and keep guard over the cloak of his murderer .        then he say to I ,    go , I shall send you far away to the Gentiles .     Paul Imprisoned .      they listen to he until he say this , but then they raise their voice and shout , take such a one as this away from the earth . it be not right that he should live .        and as they be yell and throw off their cloak and fling dust into the air ,      the cohort commander order he to be bring into the compound and give instruction that he be interrogate under the lash to determine the reason why they be make such an outcry against he .       but when they have stretch he out for the whip , Paul say to the centurion on duty , be it lawful for you to scourge a man who be a roman citizen and have not be try ?        when the centurion hear this , he go to the cohort commander and report it , say , what be you go to do ? this man be a roman citizen .      then the commander come and say to he , tell I , be you a roman citizen ? yes , he answer .      the commander reply , I acquire this citizenship for a large sum of money . Paul say , but I be bear one .      at once those who be go to interrogate he back away from he , and the commander become alarmed when he realize that he be a roman citizen and that he have have he bind .    Paul before the Sanhedrin .     the next day , wish to determine the truth about why he be be accuse by the Jews , he free he and order the chief priest and the whole Sanhedrin to convene . then he bring Paul down and make he stand before they .
