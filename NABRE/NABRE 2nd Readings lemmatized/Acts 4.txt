b '    while they be still speak to the people , the priest , the captain of the temple guard , and the Sadducees    confront they ,      disturb that they be teach the people and proclaim in Jesus the resurrection of the dead .        they lay hand on they and put they in custody until the next day , since it be already evening .      but many of those who hear the word come to believe and [ the ] number of man grow to [ about ] five thousand .    before the Sanhedrin .     on the next day , their leader , elder , and scribe be assemble in Jerusalem ,      with Annas the high priest , Caiaphas , John , Alexander , and all who be of the high - priestly class .      they bring they into their presence and question they , by what power or by what name have you do this ?      then Peter , fill with the holy Spirit , answer they , leader of the people and elder :        if we be be examine today about a good deed do to a cripple , namely , by what mean he be save ,      then all of you and all the people of Israel should know that it be in the name of Jesus Christ the Nazorean whom you crucify , whom God raise from the dead ; in his name this man stand before you heal .       he be the stone reject by you ,    the builder , which have become the cornerstone .        there be no salvation through anyone else , nor be there any other name under heaven give to the human race by which we be to be save .     observe the boldness of Peter and John and perceive they to be uneducated , ordinary man , they be amazed , and they recognize they as the companion of Jesus .      then when they see the man who have be cure stand there with they , they could say nothing in reply .      so they order they to leave the Sanhedrin , and confer with one another , say ,      what be we to do with these man ? everyone live in Jerusalem know that a remarkable sign be do through they , and we can not deny it .      but so that it may not be spread any far among the people , let we give they a stern warning never again to speak to anyone in this name .      so they call they back and order they not to speak or teach at all in the name of Jesus .      Peter and John , however , say to they in reply , whether it be right in the sight of God for we to obey you rather than God , you be the judge .        it be impossible for we not to speak about what we have see and hear .      after threaten they far , they release they , find no way to punish they , on account of the people who be all praise God for what have happen .      for the man on whom this sign of healing have be do be over forty year old .    prayer of the Community .     after their release they go back to their own people and report what the chief priest and elder have tell they .      and when they hear it , they raise their voice to God with one accord and say , Sovereign Lord , maker of heaven and earth and the sea and all that be in they ,      you say by the holy Spirit through the mouth of our father David , your servant : why do the Gentiles rage    and the people entertain folly ?   the king of the earth take their stand   and the prince gather together   against the Lord and against his anoint .     indeed they gather in this city against your holy servant Jesus whom you anoint , Herod    and Pontius Pilate , together with the Gentiles and the people of Israel ,        to do what your hand and [ your ] will have long ago plan to take place .      and now , Lord , take note of their threat , and enable your servant to speak your word with all boldness ,      as you stretch forth [ your ] hand to heal , and sign and wonder be do through the name of your holy servant Jesus .       as they pray , the place where they be gather shake , and they be all fill with the holy Spirit and continue to speak the word of God with boldness .   Life in the Christian Community .        the community of believer be of one heart and mind , and no one claim that any of his possession be his own , but they have everything in common .      with great power the apostle bear witness to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus , and great favor be accord they all .       there be no needy person among they , for those who own property or house would sell they , bring the proceed of the sale ,      and put they at the foot of the apostle , and they be distribute to each accord to need .      thus Joseph , also name by the apostle Barnabas ( which be translate son of encouragement ) , a Levite , a Cypriot by birth ,      sell a piece of property that he own , then bring the money and put it at the foot of the apostle .
