b ' the First Six seal .      then I watch while the Lamb break open the first of the seven seal , and I hear one of the four live creature cry out in a voice like thunder , come forward .      I look , and there be a white horse , and its rider have a bow .    he be give a crown , and he ride forth victorious to further his victory .      when he break open the second seal , I hear the second live creature cry out , come forward .        another horse come out , a red one . its rider be give power to take peace away from the earth , so that people would slaughter one another . and he be give a huge sword .     when he break open the third seal , I hear the third live creature cry out , come forward . I look , and there be a black horse ,    and its rider hold a scale in his hand .      I hear what seem to be a voice in the midst of the four living creature . it say , a ration of wheat cost a day pay ,    and three ration of barley cost a day pay . but do not damage the olive oil or the wine .      when he break open the fourth seal , I hear the voice of the fourth live creature cry out , come forward .      I look , and there be a pale green    horse . its rider be name death , and Hades accompany he . they be give authority over a quarter of the earth , to kill with sword , famine , and plague , and by mean of the beast of the earth .      when he break open the fifth seal , I see underneath the altar    the soul of those who have be slaughter because of the witness they bear to the word of God .      they cry out in a loud voice , how long will it be , holy and true master ,    before you sit in judgment and avenge our blood on the inhabitant of the earth ?      each of they be give a white robe , and they be tell to be patient a little while long until the number be fill of their fellow servant and brother who be go to be kill as they have be .      then I watch while he break open the sixth seal , and there be a great earthquake ; the sun turn as black as dark sackcloth    and the whole moon become like blood .        the star in the sky fall to the earth like unripe fig    shake loose from the tree in a strong wind .      then the sky be divide    like a torn scroll curl up , and every mountain and island be move from its place .        the king of the earth , the noble ,    the military officer , the rich , the powerful , and every slave and free person hide themselves in cave and among mountain crag .      they cry out to the mountain and the rock , fall on we and hide we from the face of the one who sit on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb ,        because the great day of their    wrath have come and who can withstand it ?
