b '       in the first book ,    Theophilus , I deal with all that Jesus do and teach      until the day he be take up , after give instruction through the holy Spirit to the apostle whom he have choose .        he present himself alive to they by many proof after he have suffer , appear to they during forty day    and speak about the kingdom of God .        while meet with they , he enjoin they not to depart from Jerusalem , but to wait for the promise of the Father    about which you have hear I speak ;        for John baptize with water , but in a few day you will be baptize with the holy Spirit .         when they have gather together they ask he , Lord , be you at this time go    to restore the kingdom to Israel ?       he answer they ,    it be not for you to know the time or season that the Father have establish by his own authority .       but you will receive power when the holy Spirit come upon you ,    and you will be my witness in Jerusalem , throughout Judea and Samaria , and to the end of the earth .      when he have say this , as they be look on , he be lift up , and a cloud take he from their sight .        while they be look intently at the sky as he be go , suddenly two man dress in white garment stand beside they .        they say , man of Galilee , why be you stand there look at the sky ? this Jesus who have be take up from you into heaven will return in the same way as you have see he go into heaven .         then they return to Jerusalem from the mount call Olivet , which be near Jerusalem , a sabbath day journey away .        when they enter the city they go to the upper room where they be stay , Peter and John and James and Andrew , Philip and Thomas , Bartholomew and Matthew , James son of Alphaeus , Simon the Zealot , and Judas son of James .      all these devote themselves with one accord to prayer , together with some woman , and Mary the mother of Jesus , and his brother .     the Choice of Judass Successor .     during those day Peter stand up in the midst of the brother ( there be a group of about one hundred and twenty person in the one place ) . he say ,      my brother , the scripture have to be fulfil which the holy Spirit speak beforehand through the mouth of David , concern Judas , who be the guide for those who arrest Jesus .        he be number among we and be allot a share in this ministry .       he buy a parcel of land with the wage of his iniquity , and fall headlong , he burst open in the middle , and all his inside spill out .        this become known to everyone who live in Jerusalem , so that the parcel of land be call in their language Akeldama , that is , Field of blood .      for it be write in the Book of Psalms : let his encampment become desolate ,   and may no one dwell in it . and : may another take his office .      therefore , it be necessary that one of the man who accompany we the whole time the Lord Jesus come and go among we ,      begin from the baptism of John until the day on which he be take up from we , become with we a witness to his resurrection .        so they propose two , Joseph call Barsabbas , who be also know as Justus , and Matthias .      then they pray , you , Lord , who know the heart of all , show which one of these two you have choose      to take the place in this apostolic ministry from which Judas turn away to go to his own place .        then they give lot to they , and the lot fall upon Matthias , and he be count with the eleven apostle .
