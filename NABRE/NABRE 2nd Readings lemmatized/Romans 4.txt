b ' Abraham justify by Faith .     what then can we say that Abraham find , our ancestor accord to the flesh ?         indeed , if Abraham be justify on the basis of his work , he have reason to boast ; but this be not so in the sight of God .       for what do the scripture say ? Abraham believe God , and it be credit to he as righteousness .        a worker wage be credit not as a gift , but as something due .        but when one do not work , yet believe in the one who justify the ungodly , his faith be credit as righteousness .      so also David declare the blessedness of the person to whom God credit righteousness apart from work :     bless be they whose iniquity be forgive    and whose sin be cover .   bless be the man whose sin the Lord do not record .     do this blessedness    apply only to the circumcise , or to the uncircumcised as well ? now we assert that faith be credit to Abraham as righteousness .        under what circumstance be it credit ? be he circumcise or not ? he be not circumcise , but uncircumcised .      and he receive the sign of circumcision as a seal on the righteousness receive through faith while he be uncircumcised . thus he be to be the father of all the uncircumcised who believe , so that to they [ also ] righteousness might be credit ,        as well as the father of the circumcise who not only be circumcise but also follow the path of faith that our father Abraham walk while still uncircumcised .    Inheritance through Faith .     it be not through the law that the promise be make to Abraham and his descendant that he would inherit the world , but through the righteousness that come from faith .        for if those who adhere to the law be the heir , faith be null and the promise be void .        for the law produce wrath ;    but where there be no law , neither be there violation .        for this reason , it depend on faith , so that it may be a gift , and the promise may be guarantee to all his descendant , not to those who only adhere to the law but to those who follow the faith of Abraham , who be the father of all of we ,        as it be write , I have make you father of many nation . he be our father in the sight of God , in whom he believe , who give life to the dead and call into be what do not exist .        he believe , hope against hope ,    that he would become the father of many nation , accord to what be say , thus shall your descendant be .       he do not weaken in faith when he consider his own body as [ already ] dead ( for he be almost a hundred year old ) and the dead womb of Sarah .      he do not doubt Gods promise in unbelief ;    rather , he be empower by faith and give glory to God      and be fully convinced that what he have promise he be also able to do .        that be why it be credit to he as righteousness .        but it be not for he alone that it be write that it be credit to he ;      it be also for we , to whom it will be credit , who believe in the one who raise Jesus our Lord from the dead ,        who be hand over for our transgression and be raise for our justification .
