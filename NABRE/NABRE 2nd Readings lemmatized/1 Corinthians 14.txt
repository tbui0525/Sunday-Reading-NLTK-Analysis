b '   Prophecy Greater than Tongues .      pursue love , but strive eagerly for the spiritual gift , above all that you may prophesy .         for one who speak in a tongue do not speak to human being but to God , for no one listen ; he utter mystery in spirit .      on the other hand , one who prophesy do speak to human being , for their building up ,    encouragement , and solace .        whoever speak in a tongue build himself up , but whoever prophesy build up the church .      now I should like all of you to speak in tongue , but even more to prophesy . one who prophesy be great than one who speak in tongue , unless he interpret , so that the church may be build up .      now , brother , if I should come to you speak in tongue , what good will I do you if I do not speak to you by way of revelation , or knowledge , or prophecy , or instruction ?      likewise , if inanimate thing that produce sound , such as flute or harp , do not give out the tone distinctly , how will what be be play on flute or harp be recognize ?      and if the bugle give an indistinct sound , who will get ready for battle ?      similarly , if you , because of speak in tongue , do not utter intelligible speech , how will anyone know what be be say ? for you will be talk to the air .      it happen that there be many different language in the world , and none be meaningless ;      but if I do not know the meaning of a language , I shall be a foreigner to one who speak it , and one who speak it a foreigner to I .      so with yourself : since you strive eagerly for spirit , seek to have an abundance of they for build up the church . need for Interpretation .        therefore , one who speak in a tongue should pray to be able to interpret .      [ for ] if I pray in a tongue , my spirit    be at prayer but my mind be unproductive .      so what be to be do ? I will pray with the spirit , but I will also pray with the mind . I will sing praise with the spirit , but I will also sing praise with the mind .        otherwise , if you pronounce a blessing [ with ] the spirit , how shall one who hold the place of the uninstructed say the amen to your thanksgiving , since he do not know what you be say ?      for you may be give thank very well , but the other be not build up .      I give thank to God that I speak in tongue more than any of you ,      but in the church I would rather speak five word with my mind , so as to instruct other also , than ten thousand word in a tongue .    function of these gift .      brother , stop be childish in your thinking . in respect to evil be like infant , but in your thinking be mature .        it be write in the law : by people speak strange tongue   and by the lip of foreigner I will speak to this people ,   and even so they will not listen to I ,   say the Lord .      thus , tongue be a sign not for those who believe but for unbeliever , whereas prophecy be not for unbeliever but for those who believe .      so if the whole church meet in one place and everyone speak in tongue , and then uninstructed people or unbeliever should come in , will they not say that you be out of your mind ?        but if everyone be prophesy , and an unbeliever or uninstructed person should come in , he will be convince by everyone and judge by everyone ,      and the secret of his heart will be disclose , and so he will fall down and worship God , declare , God be really in your midst .     Rules of Order .      so what be to be do , brother ? when you assemble , one have a psalm , another an instruction , a revelation , a tongue , or an interpretation . everything should be do for build up .        if anyone speak in a tongue , let it be two or at most three , and each in turn , and one should interpret .      but if there be no interpreter , the person should keep silent in the church and speak to himself and to God .     two or three prophet should speak , and the other discern .      but if a revelation be give to another person sit there , the first one should be silent .      for you can all prophesy one by one , so that all may learn and all be encourage .      indeed , the spirit of prophet be under the prophet control ,      since he be not the God of disorder but of peace . as in all the church of the holy one ,        woman should keep silent in the church , for they be not allow to speak , but should be subordinate , as even the law say .        but if they want to learn anything , they should ask their husband at home . for it be improper for a woman to speak in the church .      do the word of God go forth from you ? or have it come to you alone ?     if anyone think that he be a prophet or a spiritual person , he should recognize that what I be write to you be a commandment of the Lord .      if anyone do not acknowledge this , he be not acknowledge .      so , [ my ] brother , strive eagerly to prophesy , and do not forbid speak in tongue ,      but everything must be do properly and in order .
