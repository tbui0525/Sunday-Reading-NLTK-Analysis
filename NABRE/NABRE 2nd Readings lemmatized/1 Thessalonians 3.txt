b '    that be why , when we could bear it no long , we decide to remain alone in Athens        and send Timothy , our brother and co - worker for God in the gospel of Christ , to strengthen and encourage you in your faith ,        so that no one be disturb in these affliction . for you yourself know that we be destine    for this .      for even when we be among you , we use to warn you in advance that we would undergo affliction , just as have happen , as you know .        for this reason , when I too could bear it no long , I send to learn about your faith , for fear that somehow the tempter have put you to the test and our toil might come to nothing .     but just now Timothy have return to we from you , bring we the good news of your faith and love , and that you always think kindly of we and long to see we as we long to see you .      because of this , we have be reassure about you , brother , in our every distress and affliction , through your faith .      for we now live , if you stand firm in the Lord .    conclude Thanksgiving and Prayer .      what thanksgiving , then , can we render to God for you , for all the joy we feel on your account before our God ?      night and day we pray beyond measure to see you in person and to remedy the deficiency of your faith .      now may God himself , our Father , and our Lord Jesus direct our way to you ,      and may the Lord make you increase and abound in love for one another and for all , just as we have for you ,        so as to strengthen your heart , to be blameless in holiness before our God and Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his holy one . [ amen . ]              '
