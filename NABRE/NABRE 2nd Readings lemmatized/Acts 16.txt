Imprisonment at Philippi .     as we be go to the place of prayer , we meet a slave girl with an oracular spirit ,    who use to bring a large profit to her owner through her fortune - telling .      she begin to follow Paul and we , shout , these people be slave of the most high God , who proclaim to you a way of salvation .      she do this for many day . Paul become annoyed , turn , and say to the spirit , I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of she . then it come out at that moment .     when her owner see that their hope of profit be go , they seize Paul and Silas and drag they to the public square before the local authority .      they bring they before the magistrate    and say , these people be Jews and be disturb our city      and be advocate custom that be not lawful for we Romans to adopt or practice .       the crowd join in the attack on they , and the magistrate have they strip and order they to be beat with rod .      after inflict many blow on they , they throw they into prison and instruct the jailer to guard they securely .      when he receive these instruction , he put they in the innermost cell and secure their foot to a stake .    Deliverance from prison .     about midnight , while Paul and Silas be pray and singe hymn to God as the prisoner listen ,      there be suddenly such a severe earthquake that the foundation of the jail shake ; all the door fly open , and the chain of all be pull loose .      when the jailer wake up and see the prison door wide open , he draw [ his ] sword and be about to kill himself , think that the prisoner have escape .      but Paul shout out in a loud voice , do no harm to yourself ; we be all here .      he ask for a light and rush in and , tremble with fear , he fall down before Paul and Silas .      then he bring they out and say , Sirs , what must I do to be save ?      and they say , believe in the Lord Jesus and you and your household will be save .      so they speak the word of the Lord to he and to everyone in his house .      he take they in at that hour of the night and bathe their wound ; then he and all his family be baptize at once .      he bring they up into his house and provide a meal and with his household rejoice at having come to faith in God .     but when it be day , the magistrate send the lictor    with the order , release those man .      the jailer report the[se ] word to Paul , the magistrate have send order that you be release . now , then , come out and go in peace .      but Paul say to they , they have beat we publicly , even though we be roman citizen and have not be try , and have throw we into prison .    and now , be they go to release we secretly ? by no mean . let they come themselves and lead we out .        the lictor report these word to the magistrate , and they become alarmed when they hear that they be roman citizen .        so they come and placate they , and lead they out and ask that they leave the city .      when they have come out of the prison , they go to Lydias house where they see and encourage the brother , and then they leave .
