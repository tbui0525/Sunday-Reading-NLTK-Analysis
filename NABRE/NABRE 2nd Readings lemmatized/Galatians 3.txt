b '    justification by Faith .      o stupid    Galatians ! who have bewitch you , before whose eye Jesus Christ be publicly portray as crucify ?        I want to learn only this from you :    do you receive the Spirit from work of the law , or from faith in what you hear ?        be you so stupid ?    after begin with the Spirit , be you now end with the flesh ?        do you experience so many thing    in vain?\xe2\x80\x94if indeed it be in vain .      do , then , the one who supply the Spirit to you and work mighty deed among you do so from work of the law or from faith in what you hear ?        thus Abraham believe God ,    and it be credit to he as righteousness .       realize then that it be those who have faith who be child of Abraham .        Scripture , which see in advance that God would justify the Gentiles by faith , foretell the good news to Abraham , say , through you shall all the nation be bless .        consequently , those who have faith be bless along with Abraham who have faith .         for all who depend on work of the law be under a curse ; for it be write , curse be everyone who do not persevere in do all the thing write in the book of the law .        and that no one be justify before God by the law be clear , for the one who be righteous by faith will live .        but the law do not depend on faith ; rather , the one who do these thing will live by they .        Christ ransom we from the curse of the law by become a curse for we , for it be write , curse be everyone who hang on a tree ,        that the blessing of Abraham might be extend to the Gentiles through Christ Jesus , so that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith .     the Law do not nullify the Promise .      brother , in human term I say that no one can annul or amend even a human will once ratify .        now the promise be make to Abraham and to his descendant .    it do not say , and to descendant , as refer to many , but as refer to one , and to your descendant , who be Christ .        this be what I mean : the law , which come four hundred and thirty year afterward ,    do not annul a covenant previously ratify by God , so as to cancel the promise .        for if the inheritance come from the law ,    it be no long from a promise ; but God bestow it on Abraham through a promise .       why , then , the law ? it be add for transgression , until the descendant    come to whom the promise have be make ; it be promulgate by angel at the hand of a mediator .        now there be no mediator when only one party be involve , and God be one .        be the law then oppose to the promise [ of God ] ? of course not ! for if a law have be give that could bring life , then righteousness would in reality come from the law .        but scripture confine all thing under the power of sin , that through faith in Jesus Christ the promise might be give to those who believe .   what Faith have bring we .        before faith come , we be hold in custody under law , confine for the faith that be to be reveal .        consequently , the law be our disciplinarian    for Christ , that we might be justify by faith .        but now that faith have come , we be no long under a disciplinarian .        for through faith you be all child of God    in Christ Jesus .         for all of you who be baptize into Christ    have clothe yourself with Christ .        there be neither Jew nor Greek , there be neither slave nor free person , there be not male and female ; for you be all one in Christ Jesus .        and if you belong to Christ , then you be Abrahams descendant , heir accord to the promise .
