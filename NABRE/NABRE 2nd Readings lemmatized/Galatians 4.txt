b '   Gods Free Children in Christ .      I mean that as long as the heir be not of age ,    he be no different from a slave , although he be the owner of everything ,      but he be under the supervision of guardian and administrator until the date set by his father .       in the same way we also , when we be not of age , be enslave to the elemental power of the world .        but when the fullness of time have come , God send his Son , bear of a woman , bear under the law ,        to ransom those under the law , so that we might receive adoption .        as proof that you be child ,    God send the spirit of his Son into our heart , cry out , Abba , Father !        so you be no long a slave but a child , and if a child then also an heir , through God .   do not throw this freedom away .         at a time when you do not know God , you become slave to thing that by nature be not god ;        but now that you have come to know God , or rather to be know by God , how can you turn back again to the weak and destitute elemental power ? do you want to be slave to they all over again ?        you be observe day ,    month , season , and year .        I be afraid on your account that perhaps I have labor for you in vain .   appeal to Former Loyalty .        I implore you , brother , be as I be , because I have also become as you be .    you do I no wrong ;        you know that it be because of a physical illness    that I originally preach the gospel to you ,      and you do not show disdain or contempt because of the trial cause you by my physical condition , but rather you receive I as an angel of God , as Christ Jesus .      where now be that blessedness of yours ?    indeed , I can testify to you that , if it have be possible , you would have tear out your eye and give they to I .      so now have I become your enemy by tell you the truth ?      they show interest in you , but not in a good way ; they want to isolate you ,    so that you may show interest in they .        now it be good to be show interest for good reason at all time , and not only when I be with you .      my child , for whom I be again in labor until Christ be form in you !        I would like to be with you now and to change my tone , for I be perplexed because of you . an Allegory on Christian Freedom .        tell I , you who want to be under the law , do you not listen to the law ?      for it be write that Abraham have two son , one by the slave woman and the other by the freeborn woman .        the son of the slave woman be bear naturally , the son of the freeborn through a promise .        now this be an allegory . these woman represent two covenant . one be from Mount Sinai , bear child for slavery ; this be Hagar .        Hagar represent Sinai ,    a mountain in Arabia ; it correspond to the present Jerusalem , for she be in slavery along with her child .      but the Jerusalem above be freeborn , and she be our mother .        for it be write : rejoice , you barren one who bear no child ;    break forth and shout , you who be not in labor ; for more numerous be the child of the deserted one   than of she who have a husband .      now you , brother , like Isaac , be child of the promise .        but just as then the child of the flesh persecute the child of the spirit , it be the same now .      but what do the scripture say ? drive out the slave woman and her son !   for the son of the slave woman shall not share the inheritance with the son   of the freeborn .      therefore , brother , we be child not of the slave woman but of the freeborn woman .
