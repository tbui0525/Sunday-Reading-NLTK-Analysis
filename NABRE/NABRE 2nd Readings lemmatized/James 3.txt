b '   power of the tongue .      not many of you should become teacher , my brother , for you realize that we will be judge more strictly ,      for we all fall short in many respect . if anyone do not fall short in speech , he be a perfect man , able to bridle his whole body also .        if we put bit into the mouth of horse to make they obey we , we also guide their whole body .      it be the same with ship : even though they be so large and drive by fierce wind , they be steer by a very small rudder wherever the pilot inclination wish .      in the same way the tongue be a small member and yet have great pretension . consider how small a fire can set a huge forest ablaze .      the tongue be also a fire . it exist among our member as a world of malice , defile the whole body and set the entire course of our life on fire , itself set on fire by Gehenna .      for every kind of beast and bird , of reptile and sea creature , can be tame and have be tame by the human specie ,      but no human being can tame the tongue . it be a restless evil , full of deadly poison .        with it we bless the Lord and Father , and with it we curse human being who be make in the likeness of God .      from the same mouth come blessing and cursing . this need not be so , my brother .      do a spring gush forth from the same opening both pure and brackish water ?      can a fig tree , my brother , produce olive , or a grapevine fig ? neither can salt water yield fresh .   true Wisdom .        who among you be wise and understanding ? let he show his work by a good life in the humility that come from wisdom .        but if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your heart , do not boast and be false to the truth .      wisdom of this kind do not come down from above but be earthly , unspiritual , demonic .      for where jealousy and selfish ambition exist , there be disorder and every foul practice .      but the wisdom from above be first of all pure , then peaceable , gentle , compliant , full of mercy and good fruit , without inconstancy or insincerity .        and the fruit of righteousness be sow in peace for those who cultivate peace .
