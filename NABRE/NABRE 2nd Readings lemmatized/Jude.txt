I wish to remind you , although you know all thing , that [ the ] Lord who once save a people from the land of Egypt later destroy those who do not believe .         the angel too , who do not keep to their own domain but desert their proper dwelling , he have keep in eternal chain , in gloom , for the judgment of the great day .        likewise , Sodom , Gomorrah , and the surround town , which , in the same manner as they , indulge in sexual promiscuity and practice unnatural vice ,    serve as an example by undergo a punishment of eternal fire .      similarly , these dreamer    nevertheless also defile the flesh , scorn lordship , and revile glorious being .      yet the archangel Michael , when he argue with the devil in a dispute over the body of Moses , do not venture to pronounce a revile judgment    upon he but say , may the Lord rebuke you !        but these people revile what they do not understand and be destroy by what they know by nature like irrational animal .        Woe to they !    they follow the way of Cain , abandon themselves to Balaams error for the sake of gain , and perish in the rebellion of Korah .        these be blemish on your love feast ,    as they carouse fearlessly and look after themselves . they be waterless cloud blow about by wind , fruitless tree in late autumn , twice dead and uproot .        they be like wild wave of the sea , foam up their shameless deed , wander star for whom the gloom of darkness have be reserve forever .      Enoch , of the seventh generation from Adam , prophesy also about they when he say ,    behold , the Lord have come with his countless holy one      to execute judgment on all and to convict everyone for all the godless deed that they commit and for all the harsh word godless sinner have utter against he .      these people be complainer , disgruntle one who live by their desire ; their mouth utter bombast as they fawn over people to gain advantage .     exhortation .     but you , belove , remember the word speak beforehand by the apostle of our Lord Jesus Christ ,        for they tell you ,    in [ the ] last time there will be scoffer who will live accord to their own godless desire .        these be the one who cause division ; they live on the natural plane , devoid of the Spirit .        but you , belove , build yourself up in your most holy faith ; pray in the holy Spirit .        keep yourself in the love of God and wait for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ that lead to eternal life .        on those who waver , have mercy ;        save other by snatch they out of the fire ; on other have mercy with fear ,    abhor even the outer garment stain by the flesh . doxology .        to the one who be able to keep you from stumble and to present you unblemished and exultant , in the presence of his glory ,        to the only God , our savior , through Jesus Christ our Lord be glory , majesty , power , and authority from age past , now , and for age to come . amen .
