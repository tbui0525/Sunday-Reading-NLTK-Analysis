b '   Arrival at Tyre .      when we have take leave of they we set sail , make a straight run for Cos , and on the next day for Rhodes , and from there to Patara .      find a ship crossing to Phoenicia , we go on board and put out to sea .      we catch sight of Cyprus but pass by it on our left and sail on toward Syria and put in at Tyre where the ship be to unload cargo .      there we seek out the disciple and stay for a week . they keep tell Paul through the Spirit not to embark for Jerusalem .      at the end of our stay we leave and resume our journey . all of they , woman and child include , escort we out of the city , and after kneel on the beach to pray ,      we bid farewell to one another . then we board the ship , and they return home .    Arrival at Ptolemais and Caesarea .     we continue the voyage and come from Tyre to Ptolemais , where we greet the brother and stay a day with they .      on the next day we resume the trip and come to Caesarea , where we go to the house of Philip the evangelist , who be one of the Seven ,    and stay with he .        he have four virgin daughter gift with prophecy .      we have be there several day when a prophet name Agabus    come down from Judea .       he come up to we , take Pauls belt , bind his own foot and hand with it , and say , thus say the holy Spirit : this be the way the Jews will bind the owner of this belt in Jerusalem , and they will hand he over to the Gentiles .        when we hear this , we and the local resident beg he not to go up to Jerusalem .      then Paul reply , what be you do , weep and break my heart ? I be prepared not only to be bind but even to die in Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus .       since he would not be dissuade we let the matter rest , say ,    the Lords will be do .     Paul and James in Jerusalem .     after these day we make preparation for our journey , then go up to Jerusalem .      some of the disciple from Caesarea come along to lead we to the house of Mnason , a Cypriot , a disciple of long standing , with whom we be to stay .       when we reach Jerusalem the brother welcome we warmly .      the next day , Paul accompany we on a visit to James , and all the presbyter be present .      he greet they , then proceed to tell they in detail what God have accomplish among the Gentiles through his ministry .      they praise God when they hear it but say to he , Brother , you see how many thousand of believer there be from among the Jews , and they be all zealous observer of the law .      they have be inform that you be teach all the Jews who live among the Gentiles to abandon Moses and that you be tell they not to circumcise their child or to observe their customary practice .      what be to be do ? they will surely hear that you have arrive .       so do what we tell you . we have four man who have take a vow .        take these man and purify yourself with they , and pay their expense    that they may have their head shave . in this way everyone will know that there be nothing to the report they have be give about you but that you yourself live in observance of the law .       as for the Gentiles who have come to believe , we send they our decision that they abstain from meat sacrifice to idol , from blood , from the meat of strangle animal , and from unlawful marriage .        so Paul take the man , and on the next day after purify himself together with they enter the temple to give notice of the day when the purification would be complete and the offering make for each of they .     Pauls Arrest .     when the seven day be nearly complete , the Jews from the province of Asia notice he in the temple , stir up the whole crowd , and lay hand on he ,       shout , Fellow Israelites , help we . this be the man who be teach everyone everywhere against the people and the law and this place , and what be more , he have even bring Greeks into the temple and defile this sacred place .        for they have previously see Trophimus the Ephesian in the city with he and suppose that Paul have bring he into the temple .      the whole city be in turmoil with people rush together . they seize Paul and drag he out of the temple , and immediately the gate be close .      while they be try to kill he , a report reach the cohort commander    that all Jerusalem be riot .      he immediately take soldier and centurion and charge down on they . when they see the commander and the soldier they stop beat Paul .      the cohort commander come forward , arrest he , and order he to be secure with two chain ; he try to find out who he might be and what he have do .      some in the mob shout one thing , other something else ; so , since he be unable to ascertain the truth because of the uproar , he order Paul to be bring into the compound .      when he reach the step , he be carry by the soldier because of the violence of the mob ,        for a crowd of people follow and shout , away with he !     just as Paul be about to be take into the compound , he say to the cohort commander , may I say something to you ? he reply , do you speak Greek ?      so then you be not the Egyptian    who start a revolt some time ago and lead the four thousand assassin into the desert ?        Paul answer , I be a Jew , of Tarsus in Cilicia , a citizen of no mean city ; I request you to permit I to speak to the people .      when he have give his permission , Paul stand on the step and motion with his hand to the people ; and when all be quiet he address they in Hebrew .
