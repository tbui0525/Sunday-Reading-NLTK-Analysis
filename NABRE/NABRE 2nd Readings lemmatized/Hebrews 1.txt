b '    in time past , God speak in partial and various way to our ancestor through the prophet ;      in these last day , he speak to we through a son , whom he make heir of all thing and through whom he create the universe ,      who be the refulgence of his glory ,   the very imprint of his being , and who sustain all thing by his mighty word . when he have accomplish purification from sin , he take his seat at the right hand of the Majesty on high ,    as far superior to the angel as the name he have inherit be more excellent than theirs .   II . the Son high than the Angels Messianic Enthronement .        for to which of the angel do God ever say : you be my son ; this day I have beget you ?   or again : I will be a father to he , and he shall be a son to I ?     and again , when he lead    the first - bear into the world , he say : let all the angel of God worship he .      of the angel he say : he make his angel wind   and his minister a fiery flame ;      but of the Son : your throne , o God ,    stand forever and ever ;   and a righteous scepter be the scepter of your kingdom .    you love justice and hate wickedness ;   therefore God , your God , anoint you   with the oil of gladness above your companion ;     and : at the beginning , o Lord , you establish the earth ,    and the heaven be the work of your hand .   they will perish , but you remain ;   and they will all grow old like a garment .   you will roll they up like a cloak ,   and like a garment they will be change . but you be the same , and your year will have no end .     but to which of the angel have he ever say : sit at my right hand   until I make your enemy your footstool ?      be they not all minister spirit send to serve , for the sake of those who be to inherit salvation ?
