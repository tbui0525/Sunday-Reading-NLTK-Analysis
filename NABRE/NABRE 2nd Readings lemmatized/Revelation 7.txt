b ' the 144,000 seal .     after this I see four angel stand at the four corner of the earth ,    hold back the four wind of the earth so that no wind could blow on land or sea or against any tree .        then I see another angel come up from the East ,    hold the seal of the live God . he cry out in a loud voice to the four angel who be give power to damage the land and the sea ,      do not damage the land or the sea or the tree until we put the seal on the forehead of the servant of our God .
