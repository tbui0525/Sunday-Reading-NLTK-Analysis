b '    denial of the Parousia .      this be now , belove , the second letter I be write to you ; through they by way of reminder I be try to stir up your sincere disposition ,      to recall the word previously speak by the holy prophet and the commandment of the Lord and savior through your apostle .        know this first of all , that in the last day scoffer    will come [ to ] scoff , live accord to their own desire        and say , where be the promise of his come ?    from the time when our ancestor fall asleep , everything have remain as it be from the beginning of creation .        they deliberately ignore the fact that the heavens exist of old and earth be form out of water and through water    by the word of God ;        through these the world that then exist be destroy ,    deluge with water .        the present heaven and earth have be reserve by the same word for fire , keep for the day of judgment and of destruction of the godless .       but do not ignore this one fact , belove , that with the Lord one day be like a thousand year    and a thousand year like one day .        the Lord do not delay his promise , as some regard delay , but he be patient with you , not wish that any should perish but that all should come to repentance .        but the day of the Lord will come like a thief ,    and then the heaven will pass away with a mighty roar and the element will be dissolve by fire , and the earth and everything do on it will be find out .   Exhortation to Preparedness .        since everything be to be dissolve in this way , what sort of person ought [ you ] to be , conduct yourself in holiness and devotion ,         wait for and hasten the coming of the day of God ,    because of which the heaven will be dissolve in flame and the element melt by fire .      but accord to his promise we await new heaven and a new earth    in which righteousness dwell .      therefore , belove , since you await these thing , be eager to be find without spot or blemish before he , at peace .      and consider the patience of our Lord as salvation , as our beloved brother Paul , accord to the wisdom give to he , also write to you ,        speak of these thing    as he do in all his letter . in they there be some thing hard to understand that the ignorant and unstable distort to their own destruction , just as they do the other scripture .    V. Final Exhortation and Doxology    therefore , belove , since you be forewarn , be on your guard not to be lead into the error of the unprincipled and to fall from your own stability .        but grow in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and savior Jesus Christ . to he be glory now and to the day of eternity . [ amen . ]              '
