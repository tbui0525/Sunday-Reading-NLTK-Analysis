b '   the First Beast .      then I see a beast come out of the sea with ten horn and seven head ; on its horn be ten diadem , and on its head blasphemous name[s ] .        the beast I see be like a leopard , but it have foot like a bear , and its mouth be like the mouth of a lion .     to it the dragon give its own power and throne , along with great authority .      I see that one of its head seem to have be mortally wound , but this mortal wound be heal .    Fascinated , the whole world follow after the beast .      they worship the dragon because it give its authority to the beast ; they also worship the beast    and say , who can compare with the beast or who can fight against it ?      the beast be give a mouth utter proud boast and blasphemy ,    and it be give authority to act for forty - two month .        it open its mouth to utter blasphemy against God , blaspheme his name and his dwelling and those who dwell in heaven .      it be also allow to wage war against the holy one and conquer they , and it be grant authority over every tribe , people , tongue , and nation .        all the inhabitant of the earth will worship it , all whose name be not write from the foundation of the world in the book of life , which belong to the Lamb who be slay .      whoever have ear ought to hear these word .    anyone destine for captivity go into captivity . anyone destine to be slay by the sword shall be slay by the sword .   such be the faithful endurance of the holy one . the Second Beast .        then I see another beast come up out of the earth ; it have two horn like a lamb but speak like a dragon .      it wield all the authority of the first beast in its sight and make the earth and its inhabitant worship the first beast , whose mortal wound have be heal .      it perform great sign , even make fire come down from heaven to earth in the sight of everyone .        it deceive the inhabitant of the earth with the sign it be allow to perform in the sight of the first beast , tell they to make an image for the beast who have be wound by the sword and revive .      it be then permit to breathe life into the beast image , so that the beast image could speak and [ could ] have anyone who do not worship it put to death .        it force all the people , small and great , rich and poor , free and slave , to be give a stamp image on their right hand or their forehead ,        so that no one could buy or sell except one who have the stamp image of the beast name or the number that stand for its name .       wisdom be need here ; one who understand can calculate the number of the beast , for it be a number that stand for a person . his number be six hundred and sixty - six .
