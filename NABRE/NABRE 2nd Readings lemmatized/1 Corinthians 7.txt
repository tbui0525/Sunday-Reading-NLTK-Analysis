b ' iii . answer to the Corinthians question chapter 7 advice to the married .      now in regard to the matter about which you write : it be a good thing for a man not to touch a woman ,        but because of case of immorality every man should have his own wife , and every woman her own husband .      the husband should fulfill his duty toward his wife , and likewise the wife toward her husband .      a wife do not have authority over her own body , but rather her husband , and similarly a husband do not have authority over his own body , but rather his wife .      do not deprive each other , except perhaps by mutual consent for a time , to be free for prayer , but then return to one another , so that Satan may not tempt you through your lack of self - control .      this I say by way of concession ,    however , not as a command .      indeed , I wish everyone to be as I be , but each have a particular gift from God ,    one of one kind and one of another .        now to the unmarried and to widow I say : it be a good thing for they to remain as they be , as I do ,      but if they can not exercise self - control they should marry , for it be well to marry than to be on fire .       to the married , however , I give this instruction ( not I , but the Lord ):    a wife should not separate from her husband      \xe2\x80\x94and if she do separate she must either remain single or become reconcile to she husband\xe2\x80\x94and a husband should not divorce his wife .     to the rest    I say ( not the Lord ): if any brother have a wife who be an unbeliever , and she be willing to go on live with he , he should not divorce she ;      and if any woman have a husband who be an unbeliever , and he be willing to go on live with she , she should not divorce her husband .      for the unbelieving husband be make holy through his wife , and the unbelieving wife be make holy through the brother . otherwise your child would be unclean , whereas in fact they be holy .      if the unbeliever separate ,    however , let he separate . the brother or sister be not bind in such case ; God have call you to peace .      for how do you know , wife , whether you will save your husband ; or how do you know , husband , whether you will save your wife ? the life that the Lord have assign .        only , everyone should live as the Lord have assign , just as God call each one . I give this order in all the church .      be someone call after he have be circumcise ? he should not try to undo his circumcision . be an uncircumcised person call ? he should not be circumcise .        Circumcision mean nothing , and uncircumcision mean nothing ; what matter be keep Gods commandment .        everyone should remain in the state in which he be call .     be you a slave when you be call ? do not be concerned but , even if you can gain your freedom , make the most of it .      for the slave call in the Lord be a free person in the Lord , just as the free person who have be call be a slave of Christ .        you have be purchase at a price . do not become slave to human being .        brother , everyone should continue before God in the state in which he be call .    Advice to Virgins and widow .     now in regard to virgin I have no commandment from the Lord ,    but I give my opinion as one who by the Lords mercy be trustworthy .      so this be what I think good because of the present distress : that it be a good thing for a person to remain as he be .        be you bind to a wife ? do not seek a separation . be you free of a wife ? then do not look for a wife .      if you marry , however , you do not sin , nor do an unmarried woman sin if she marry ; but such people will experience affliction in their earthly life , and I would like to spare you that .      I tell you , brother , the time be run out . from now on , let those have wife act as not have they ,        those weep as not weep , those rejoice as not rejoice , those buying as not own ,      those use the world as not use it fully . for the world in its present form be pass away .     I should like you to be free of anxiety . an unmarried man be anxious about the thing of the Lord , how he may please the Lord .      but a married man be anxious about the thing of the world , how he may please his wife ,        and he be divide . an unmarried woman or a virgin be anxious about the thing of the Lord , so that she may be holy in both body and spirit . a married woman , on the other hand , be anxious about the thing of the world , how she may please her husband .        I be tell you this for your own benefit , not to impose a restraint upon you , but for the sake of propriety and adherence to the Lord without distraction .       if anyone think he be behave improperly toward his virgin , and if a critical moment have come    and so it have to be , let he do as he wish . he be commit no sin ; let they get marry .      the one who stand firm in his resolve , however , who be not under compulsion but have power over his own will , and have make up his mind to keep his virgin , will be do well .      so then , the one who marry his virgin do well ; the one who do not marry she will do well .      a wife be bind to her husband as long as he live . but if her husband die , she be free to be marry to whomever she wish , provide that it be in the Lord .        she be more blessed , though , in my opinion , if she remain as she be , and I think that I too have the Spirit of God .
