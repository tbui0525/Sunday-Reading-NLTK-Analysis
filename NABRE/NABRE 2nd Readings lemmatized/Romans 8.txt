b '   the Flesh and the Spirit .      hence , now there be no condemnation for those who be in Christ Jesus .      for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus have free you from the law of sin and death .        for what the law , weaken by the flesh , be powerless to do , this God have do : by send his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for the sake of sin , he condemn sin in the flesh ,        so that the righteous decree of the law might be fulfil in we , who live not accord to the flesh but accord to the spirit .        for those who live accord to the flesh be concern with the thing of the flesh , but those who live accord to the spirit with the thing of the spirit .      the concern of the flesh be death , but the concern of the spirit be life and peace .        for the concern of the flesh be hostility toward God ; it do not submit to the law of God , nor can it ;        and those who be in the flesh can not please God .        but you be not in the flesh ; on the contrary , you be in the spirit , if only the Spirit of God dwell in you . whoever do not have the Spirit of Christ do not belong to he .        but if Christ be in you , although the body be dead because of sin , the spirit be alive because of righteousness .        if the Spirit of the one who raise Jesus from the dead dwell in you , the one who raise Christ from the dead will give life to your mortal body also , through his Spirit that dwell in you .      consequently , brother , we be not debtor to the flesh , to live accord to the flesh .      for if you live accord to the flesh , you will die , but if by the spirit you put to death the deed of the body , you will live .   child of God through Adoption .        for those who be lead by the Spirit of God be child of God .        for you do not receive a spirit of slavery to fall back into fear , but you receive a spirit of adoption , through which we cry , Abba ,    Father !        the Spirit itself bear witness with our spirit that we be child of God ,        and if child , then heir , heir of God and joint heir with Christ , if only we suffer with he so that we may also be glorify with he .   Destiny of Glory .        I consider that the suffering of this present time be as nothing compare with the glory to be reveal for we .        for creation await with eager expectation the revelation of the child of God ;      for creation be make subject to futility , not of its own accord but because of the one who subject it ,    in hope      that creation itself would be set free from slavery to corruption and share in the glorious freedom of the child of God .        we know that all creation be groan in labor pain even until now ;        and not only that , but we ourselves , who have the firstfruit of the Spirit , we also groan within ourselves as we wait for adoption , the redemption of our body .        for in hope we be save . now hope that see for itself be not hope . for who hope for what one see ?        but if we hope for what we do not see , we wait with endurance .     in the same way , the Spirit too come to the aid of our weakness ; for we do not know how to pray as we ought , but the Spirit itself intercede with inexpressible groaning .      and the one who search heart know what be the intention of the Spirit , because it intercede for the holy one accord to Gods will .     Gods Indomitable Love in Christ .      we know that all thing work for good for those who love God ,    who be call accord to his purpose .         for those he foreknow he also predestine to be conform to the image of his Son , so that he might be the firstborn among many brother .        and those he predestine he also call ; and those he call he also justify ; and those he justify he also glorify .       what then shall we say to this ? if God be for we , who can be against we ?        he who do not spare his own Son but hand he over for we all , how will he not also give we everything else along with he ?        who will bring a charge against Gods chosen one ? it be God who acquit we .        who will condemn ? it be Christ [ Jesus ] who die , rather , be raise , who also be at the right hand of God , who indeed intercede for we .        what will separate we from the love of Christ ? will anguish , or distress , or persecution , or famine , or nakedness , or peril , or the sword ?      as it be write :   for your sake we be be slay all the day ;   we be look upon as sheep to be slaughter .     no , in all these thing we conquer overwhelmingly through he who love we .        for I be convinced that neither death , nor life , nor angel , nor principality , nor present thing ,    nor future thing , nor power ,        nor height , nor depth ,    nor any other creature will be able to separate we from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord .
