b '   the Sabbath Rest .     therefore , let we be on our guard while the promise of enter into his rest remain , that none of you seem to have fail .      for in fact we have receive the good news just as they do . but the word that they hear do not profit they , for they be not unite in faith with those who listen .      for we who believe enter into [ that ] rest , just as he have say :   as I swear in my wrath ,   they shall not enter into my rest , and yet his work be accomplish at the foundation of the world .      for he have speak somewhere about the seventh day in this manner , and God rest on the seventh day from all his work ;        and again , in the previously mention place , they shall not enter into my rest .        therefore , since it remain that some will enter into it , and those who formerly receive the good news do not enter because of disobedience ,      he once more set a day , today , when long afterwards he speak through David , as already quote :   oh , that today you would hear his voice : Harden not your heart .     now if Joshua have give they rest , he would not have speak afterwards of another day .        therefore , a sabbath rest still remain for the people of God .      and whoever enter into Gods rest , rest from his own work as God do from his .      therefore , let we strive to enter into that rest , so that no one may fall after the same example of disobedience .     indeed , the word of God be live and effective , sharp than any two - edge sword , penetrate even between soul and spirit , joint and marrow , and able to discern reflection and thought of the heart .        no creature be conceal from he , but everything be naked and expose to the eye of he to whom we must render an account .     Jesus , Compassionate High Priest .      therefore , since we have a great high priest who have pass through the heavens , Jesus , the Son of God , let we hold fast to our confession .        for we do not have a high priest who be unable to sympathize with our weakness , but one who have similarly be test in every way , yet without sin .        so let we confidently approach the throne of grace to receive mercy and to find grace for timely help .
