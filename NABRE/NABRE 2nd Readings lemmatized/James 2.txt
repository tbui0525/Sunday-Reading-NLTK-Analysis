b '   sin of Partiality .      my brother , show no partiality as you adhere to the faith in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ .      for if a man with gold ring on his finger and in fine clothe come into your assembly , and a poor person in shabby clothe also come in ,      and you pay attention to the one wear the fine clothe and say , sit here , please , while you say to the poor one , stand there , or sit at my foot ,      have you not make distinction among yourself and become judge with evil design ?      listen , my beloved brother . do not God choose those who be poor    in the world to be rich in faith and heir of the kingdom that he promise to those who love he ?        but you dishonor the poor person . be not the rich oppress you ? and do they themselves not haul you off to court ?      be it not they who blaspheme the noble name that be invoke over you ?        however , if you fulfill the royal    law accord to the scripture , you shall love your neighbor as yourself , you be do well .        but if you show partiality , you commit sin , and be convict by the law as transgressor .        for whoever keep the whole law , but fall short in one particular , have become guilty in respect to all of it .        for he who say , you shall not commit adultery , also say , you shall not kill .    even if you do not commit adultery but kill , you have become a transgressor of the law .       so speak and so act as people who will be judge by the law of freedom .        for the judgment be merciless to one who have not show mercy ; mercy triumph over judgment .   Faith and Works .        what good be it , my brother , if someone say he have faith but do not have work ? can that faith save he ?        if a brother or sister have nothing to wear and have no food for the day ,      and one of you say to they , go in peace , keep warm , and eat well , but you do not give they the necessity of the body , what good be it ?        so also faith of itself , if it do not have work , be dead .     indeed someone may say , you have faith and I have work . demonstrate your faith to I without work , and I will demonstrate my faith to you from my work .      you believe that God be one . you do well . even the demon believe that and tremble .      do you want proof , you ignoramus , that faith without work be useless ?      be not Abraham our father justify by work when he offer his son Isaac upon the altar ?        you see that faith be active along with his work , and faith be complete by the work .      thus the scripture be fulfil that say , Abraham believe God , and it be credit to he as righteousness , and he be call the friend of God .        see how a person be justify by work and not by faith alone .      and in the same way , be not Rahab the harlot also justify by work when she welcome the messenger and send they out by a different route ?        for just as a body without a spirit be dead , so also faith without work be dead .
