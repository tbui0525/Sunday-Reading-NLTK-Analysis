b '   Timothys Conduct .      so you , my child , be strong in the grace that be in Christ Jesus .      and what you hear from I through many witness entrust to faithful people who will have the ability to teach other as well .      Bear your share of hardship along with I like a good soldier of Christ Jesus .        to satisfy the one who recruit he , a soldier do not become entangled in the business affair of life .        similarly , an athlete can not receive the winner crown except by compete accord to the rule .        the hardworking farmer ought to have the first share of the crop .        reflect on what I be say , for the Lord will give you understand in everything .       remember Jesus Christ , raise from the dead , a descendant of David : such be my gospel ,        for which I be suffer , even to the point of chain , like a criminal . but the word of God be not chain .        therefore , I bear with everything for the sake of those who be choose , so that they too may obtain the salvation that be in Christ Jesus , together with eternal glory .        this saying be trustworthy : if we have die with he   we shall also live with he ;    if we persevere   we shall also reign with he . but if we deny he   he will deny we .    if we be unfaithful   he remain faithful ,   for he can not deny himself .      warn against useless dispute .      remind people of these thing and charge they before God    to stop dispute about word . this serve no useful purpose since it harm those who listen .        be eager to present yourself as acceptable to God , a workman who cause no disgrace , impart the word of truth without deviation .        avoid profane , idle talk , for such people will become more and more godless ,        and their teaching will spread like gangrene . among they be Hymenaeus and Philetus ,        who have deviate from the truth by say that [ the ] resurrection have already take place and be upset the faith of some .        nevertheless , Gods solid foundation stand , bear this inscription , the Lord know those who be his ; and , let everyone who call upon the name of the Lord avoid evil .      in a large household there be vessel not only of gold and silver but also of wood and clay , some for lofty and other for humble use .      if anyone cleanse himself of these thing , he will be a vessel for lofty use , dedicate , beneficial to the master of the house , ready for every good work .        so turn from youthful desire and pursue righteousness , faith , love , and peace , along with those who call on the Lord    with purity of heart .        avoid foolish and ignorant debate , for you know that they breed quarrel .        a slave of the Lord should not quarrel , but should be gentle with everyone , able to teach , tolerant ,        correct opponent with kindness . it may be that God will grant they repentance that lead to knowledge of the truth ,         and that they may return to their sense out of the devil snare ,    where they be entrap by he , for his will .
