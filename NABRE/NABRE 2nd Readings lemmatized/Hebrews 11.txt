b '   Faith of the Ancients .     Faith be the realization of what be hope for and evidence    of thing not see .        because of it the ancient be well attested .       by faith we understand that the universe be order by the word of God ,    so that what be visible come into be through the invisible .       by faith Abel offer to God a sacrifice great than cain . through this he be attest to be righteous , God bear witness to his gift , and through this , though dead , he still speak .        by faith Enoch be take up so that he should not see death , and he be find no more because God have take he . before he be take up , he be attest to have please God .         but without faith it be impossible to please he ,    for anyone who approach God must believe that he exist and that he reward those who seek he .      by faith Noah , warn about what be not yet see , with reverence build an ark for the salvation of his household . through this he condemn the world and inherit the righteousness that come through faith .      by faith Abraham obey when he be call to go out to a place that he be to receive as an inheritance ; he go out , not know where he be to go .        by faith he sojourn in the promise land as in a foreign country , dwell in tent with Isaac and Jacob , heir of the same promise ;        for he be look forward to the city with foundation , whose architect and maker be God .        by faith he receive power to generate , even though he be past the normal age\xe2\x80\x94and Sarah herself be sterile\xe2\x80\x94for he think that the one who have make the promise be trustworthy .        so it be that there come forth from one man , himself as good as dead , descendant as numerous as the star in the sky and as countless as the sand on the seashore .      all these die in faith . they do not receive what have be promise but see it and greet it from afar and acknowledge themselves to be stranger and alien on earth ,        for those who speak thus show that they be seek a homeland .      if they have be think of the land from which they have come , they would have have opportunity to return .      but now they desire a well homeland , a heavenly one . therefore , God be not ashamed to be call their God , for he have prepare a city for they .      by faith Abraham , when put to the test , offer up Isaac , and he who have receive the promise be ready to offer his only son ,        of whom it be say , through Isaac descendant shall bear your name .         he reason that God be able to raise even from the dead ,    and he receive Isaac back as a symbol .      by faith regard thing still to come Isaac    bless Jacob and Esau .        by faith Jacob , when die , bless each of the son of Joseph and bow in worship , lean on the top of his staff .        by faith Joseph , near the end of his life , speak of the Exodus of the Israelites and give instruction about his bone .       by faith Moses be hide by his parent for three month after his birth , because they see that he be a beautiful child , and they be not afraid of the king edict .       by faith Moses , when he have grow up , refuse to be know as the son of Pharaohs daughter ;        he choose to be ill - treat along with the people of God rather than enjoy the fleeting pleasure of sin .      he consider the reproach of the anoint great wealth than the treasure of Egypt , for he be look to the recompense .      by faith he leave Egypt , not fear the king fury , for he persevere as if see the one who be invisible .        by faith he keep the Passover and sprinkle the blood , that the Destroyer of the firstborn might not touch they .        by faith they cross the Red Sea as if it be dry land , but when the Egyptians attempt it they be drown .        by faith the wall of Jericho fall after be encircle for seven day .        by faith Rahab the harlot do not perish with the disobedient , for she have receive the spy in peace .      what more shall I say ? I have not time to tell of Gideon , Barak , Samson , Jephthah , of David and Samuel and the prophet ,        who by faith conquer kingdom , do what be righteous , obtain the promise ; they close the mouth of lion ,        put out rage fire , escape the devour sword ; out of weakness they be make powerful , become strong in battle , and turn back foreign invader .        woman receive back their dead through resurrection . some be torture and would not accept deliverance , in order to obtain a well resurrection .        other endure mockery , scourge , even chain and imprisonment .        they be stone , saw in two , put to death at sword point ; they go about in skin of sheep or goat , needy , afflict , torment .        the world be not worthy of they . they wander about in desert and on mountain , in cave and in crevice in the earth .      yet all these , though approve because of their faith , do not receive what have be promise .      God have foresee something well for we , so that without we they should not be make perfect .              '
