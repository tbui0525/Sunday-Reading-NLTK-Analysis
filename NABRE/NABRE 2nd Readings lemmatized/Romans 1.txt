II . humanity lose without the Gospel Gods Power for Salvation .        for I be not ashamed of the gospel . it be the power of God for the salvation of everyone who believe : for Jew first , and then Greek .        for in it be reveal the righteousness of God from faith to faith ;    as it be write , the one who be righteous by faith will live .     punishment of Idolaters .      the wrath    of God    be indeed be reveal from heaven against every impiety and wickedness    of those who suppress the truth by their wickedness .      for what can be know about God be evident to they , because God make it evident to they .        ever since the creation of the world , his invisible attribute of eternal power and divinity have be able to be understand and perceive in what he have make .    as a result , they have no excuse ;      for although they know God they do not accord he glory as God or give he thank . instead , they become vain in their reasoning , and their senseless mind be darken .        while claim to be wise ,    they become fool      and exchange the glory of the immortal God for the likeness of an image of mortal man or of bird or of four - legged animal or of snake .      therefore , God hand they over to impurity through the lust of their heart    for the mutual degradation of their body .        they exchange the truth of God for a lie and revere and worship the creature rather than the creator , who be bless forever . amen .        therefore , God hand they over to degrade passion . their female exchange natural relation for unnatural ,      and the male likewise give up natural relation with female and burn with lust for one another . male do shameful thing with male and thus receive in their own person the due penalty for their perversity .        and since they do not see fit to acknowledge God , God hand they over to their undiscerning mind to do what be improper .       they be fill with every form of wickedness , evil , greed , and malice ; full of envy , murder , rivalry , treachery , and spite . they be gossip      and scandalmonger and they hate God . they be insolent , haughty , boastful , ingenious in their wickedness , and rebellious toward their parent .      they be senseless , faithless , heartless , ruthless .      although they know the just decree of God that all who practice such thing deserve death , they not only do they but give approval to those who practice they .
