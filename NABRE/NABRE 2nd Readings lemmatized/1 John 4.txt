b '   test the Spirits .      beloved , do not trust every spirit but test the spirit to see whether they belong to God , because many false prophet have go out into the world .        this be how you can know the Spirit of God : every spirit that acknowledge Jesus Christ come in the flesh belong to God ,        and every spirit that do not acknowledge Jesus    do not belong to God . this be the spirit of the antichrist that , as you hear , be to come , but in fact be already in the world .        you belong to God , child , and you have conquer they , for the one who be in you be great than the one who be in the world .      they belong to the world ; accordingly , their teaching belong to the world , and the world listen to they .        we belong to God , and anyone who know God listen to we , while anyone who do not belong to God refuse to hear we . this be how we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of deceit .     Gods Love and Christian Life .      beloved , let we love one another , because love be of God ; everyone who love be beget by God and know God .      whoever be without love do not know God , for God be love .      in this way the love of God be reveal to we : God send his only Son into the world so that we might have life through he .        in this be love : not that we have love God , but that he love we and send his Son as expiation for our sin .        beloved , if God so love we , we also must love one another .      no one have ever see God . yet , if we love one another , God remain in we , and his love be bring to perfection in we .       this be how we know that we remain in he and he in we , that he have give we of his Spirit .      moreover , we have see and testify that the Father send his Son as savior of the world .      whoever acknowledge that Jesus be the Son of God , God remain in he and he in God .      we have come to know and to believe in the love God have for we . God be love , and whoever remain in love remain in God and God in he .      in this be love bring to perfection among we , that we have confidence on the day of judgment because as he be , so be we in this world .        there be no fear in love , but perfect love drive out fear because fear have to do with punishment , and so one who fear be not yet perfect in love .      we love because he first love we .      if anyone say , I love God , but hate his brother , he be a liar ; for whoever do not love a brother whom he have see can not love God    whom he have not see .        this be the commandment we have from he : whoever love God must also love his brother .
