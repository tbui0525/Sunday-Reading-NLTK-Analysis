b '   Unity in the body .      I , then , a prisoner for the Lord , urge you to live in a manner worthy of the call you have receive ,        with all humility and gentleness , with patience , bear with one another through love ,        strive to preserve the unity of the spirit through the bond of peace :         one body and one Spirit , as you be also call to the one hope of your call ;        one Lord , one faith , one baptism ;        one God and Father of all , who be over all and through all and in all .     Diversity of Gifts .     but grace be give to each of we accord to the measure of Christs gift .        therefore , it say : he ascend    on high and take prisoner captive ;   he give gift to man .      what do he ascend mean except that he also descend into the low [ region ] of the earth ?      the one who descend be also the one who ascend far above all the heaven , that he might fill all thing .      and he give some as apostle , other as prophet , other as evangelist , other as pastor and teacher ,        to equip the holy one for the work of ministry ,    for build up the body of Christ ,      until we all attain to the unity of faith and knowledge of the Son of God , to mature manhood ,    to the extent of the full stature of Christ ,        so that we may no long be infant , toss by wave and sweep along by every wind of teaching arise from human trickery , from their cunning in the interest of deceitful scheming .        rather , live the truth in love , we should grow in every way into he who be the head ,    Christ ,        from whom the whole body , join and hold together by every support ligament , with the proper functioning of each part , bring about the bodys growth and build itself up in love .   Renewal in Christ .        so I declare and testify in the Lord that you must no long live as the Gentiles do , in the futility of their mind ;        darken in understanding , alienate from the life of God because of their ignorance , because of their hardness of heart ,        they have become callous and have hand themselves over to licentiousness for the practice of every kind of impurity to excess .        that be not how you learn Christ ,      assume that you have hear of he and be teach in he , as truth be in Jesus ,      that you should put away the old self of your former way of life , corrupt through deceitful desire ,        and be renew in the spirit of your mind ,        and put on    the new self , create in Gods way in righteousness and holiness of truth .     rule for the New Life .     therefore , put away falsehood , speak the truth , each one to his neighbor , for we be member one of another .        be angry but do not sin ;    do not let the sun set on your anger ,        and do not leave room for the devil .        the thief must no long steal , but rather labor , do honest work    with his [ own ] hand , so that he may have something to share with one in need .        no foul language should come out of your mouth , but only such as be good for needed edification , that it may impart grace to those who hear .        and do not grieve the holy Spirit of God , with which you be seal for the day of redemption .        all bitterness , fury , anger , shout , and reviling must be remove from you , along with all malice .        [ and ] be kind to one another , compassionate , forgive one another as God have forgive you in Christ .              '
