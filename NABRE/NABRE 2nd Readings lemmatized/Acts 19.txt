b '   Paul in Ephesus .      while Apollos be in Corinth , Paul travel through the interior of the country and come [ down ] to Ephesus where he find some disciple .      he say to they , do you receive the holy Spirit when you become believer ? they answer he , we have never even hear that there be a holy Spirit .      he say , how be you baptize ? they reply , with the baptism of John .      Paul then say , John baptize with a baptism of repentance , tell the people to believe in the one who be to come after he , that is , in Jesus .        when they hear this , they be baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus .      and when Paul lay [ his ] hand on they , the holy Spirit come upon they , and they speak in tongue and prophesy .        altogether there be about twelve man .     he enter the synagogue , and for three month debate boldly with persuasive argument about the kingdom of God .      but when some in their obstinacy and disbelief disparage the way before the assembly , he withdraw and take his disciple with he and begin to hold daily discussion in the lecture hall of Tyrannus .      this continue for two year with the result that all the inhabitant of the province of Asia hear the word of the Lord , Jews and Greeks alike .      so extraordinary be the mighty deed God accomplish at the hand of Paul      that when face cloth or apron that touch his skin be apply to the sick , their disease leave they and the evil spirit come out of they .     the jewish Exorcists .     then some itinerant jewish exorcist try to invoke the name of the Lord Jesus over those with evil spirit , say , I adjure you by the Jesus whom Paul preach .      when the seven son of Sceva , a jewish high priest , try to do this ,      the evil spirit say to they in reply , Jesus I recognize , Paul I know , but who be you ?      the person with the evil spirit then spring at they and subdue they all . he so overpower they that they flee naked and wound from that house .      when this became know to all the Jews and Greeks who live in Ephesus , fear fall upon they all , and the name of the Lord Jesus be hold in great esteem .      many of those who have become believer come forward and openly acknowledge their former practice .      moreover , a large number of those who have practice magic collect their book and burn they in public . they calculate their value and find it to be fifty thousand silver piece .      thus do the word of the Lord continue to spread with influence and power .    Pauls Plans .     when this be conclude , Paul make up his mind to travel through Macedonia and Achaia , and then to go on to Jerusalem , say , after I have be there , I must visit Rome also .        then he send to Macedonia two of his assistant , Timothy and Erastus , while he himself stay for a while in the province of Asia .    the riot of the Silversmiths .     about that time a serious disturbance break out concern the way .      there be a silversmith name Demetrius who make miniature silver shrine of Artemis    and provide no little work for the craftsman .      he call a meeting of these and other worker in related craft and say , man , you know well that our prosperity derive from this work .      as you can now see and hear , not only in Ephesus but throughout most of the province of Asia this Paul have persuade and mislead a great number of people by say that god make by hand be not god at all .        the danger grow , not only that our business will be discredit , but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis will be of no account , and that she whom the whole province of Asia and all the world worship will be strip of her magnificence .     when they hear this , they be fill with fury and begin to shout , Great be Artemis of the Ephesians !      the city be fill with confusion , and the people rush with one accord into the theater , seize Gaius and Aristarchus , the Macedonians , Pauls travel companion .        Paul want to go before the crowd , but the disciple would not let he ,      and even some of the Asiarchs    who be friend of his send word to he advise he not to venture into the theater .      meanwhile , some be shout one thing , other something else ; the assembly be in chaos , and most of the people have no idea why they have come together .      some of the crowd prompt Alexander , as the Jews push he forward , and Alexander signal with his hand that he wish to explain something to the gathering .      but when they recognize that he be a Jew , they all shout in unison , for about two hour , Great be Artemis of the Ephesians !      finally the town clerk restrain the crowd and say , you Ephesians , what person be there who do not know that the city of the Ephesians be the guardian of the temple    of the great Artemis and of her image that fall from the sky ?      since these thing be undeniable , you must calm yourself and not do anything rash .      the man you bring here be not temple robber , nor have they insult our goddess .      if Demetrius and his fellow craftsman have a complaint against anyone , court be in session , and there be proconsul . let they bring charge against one another .      if you have anything far to investigate , let the matter be settle in the lawful assembly ,      for , as it be , we be in danger of be charge with rioting because of today conduct . there be no cause for it . we shall [ not ]    be able to give a reason for this demonstration . with these word he dismiss the assembly .
