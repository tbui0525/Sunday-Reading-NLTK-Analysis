b '   one Sacrifice instead of many .      since the law have only a shadow of the good thing to come ,    and not the very image of they , it can never make perfect those who come to worship by the same sacrifice that they offer continually each year .        otherwise , would not the sacrifice have cease to be offer , since the worshiper , once cleanse , would no long have have any consciousness of sin ?      but in those sacrifice there be only a yearly remembrance of sin ,        for it be impossible that the blood of bull and goat take away sin .        for this reason , when he come into the world , he say :   sacrifice and offer you do not desire ,    but a body you prepare for I ;   holocaust and sin offering you take no delight in .   then I say , as be write of I in the scroll ,   behold , I come to do your will , o God .     first he say , sacrifice and offering , holocaust and sin offering ,    you neither desire nor delight in . these be offer accord to the law .        then he say , Behold , I come to do your will . he take away the first to establish the second .        by this will , we have be consecrate through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all .       every priest stand daily at his ministry , offer frequently those same sacrifice that can never take away sin .        but this one offer one sacrifice for sin , and take his seat forever at the right hand of God ;         now he wait until his enemy be make his footstool .      for by one offering he have make perfect forever those who be be consecrate .         the holy Spirit also testify to we , for after say :     this be the covenant I will establish with they after those day , say the Lord :   I will put my law in their heart ,   and I will write they upon their mind ,      he also say :   their sin and their evildoe   I will remember no more .      where there be forgiveness of these , there be no long offer for sin . recall the past .        therefore , brother , since through the blood of Jesus we have confidence of entrance into the sanctuary         by the new and living way he open for we through the veil ,    that be , his flesh ,        and since we have a great priest over the house of God ,      let we approach with a sincere heart and in absolute trust , with our heart sprinkle clean from an evil conscience    and our body wash in pure water .        let we hold unwaveringly to our confession that give we hope , for he who make the promise be trustworthy .        we must consider how to rouse one another to love and good work .      we should not stay away from our assembly ,    as be the custom of some , but encourage one another , and this all the more as you see the day draw near .        if we sin deliberately after receive knowledge of the truth , there no long remain sacrifice for sin      but a fearful prospect of judgment and a flame fire that be go to consume the adversary .        anyone who reject the law of Moses    be put to death without pity on the testimony of two or three witness .        do you not think that a much bad punishment be due the one who have contempt for the Son of God , consider unclean the covenant - blood by which he be consecrate , and insult the spirit of grace ?        we know the one who say : Vengeance be mine ; I will repay , and again : the Lord will judge his people .      it be a fearful thing to fall into the hand of the live God .      remember the day past when , after you have be enlighten ,    you endure a great contest of suffering .        at time you be publicly expose to abuse and affliction ; at other time you associate yourself with those so treated .        you even join in the suffering of those in prison and joyfully accept the confiscation of your property , know that you have a well and lasting possession .        therefore , do not throw away your confidence ; it will have great recompense .        you need endurance to do the will of God and receive what he have promise .      for , after just a brief moment ,    he who be to come shall come ;   he shall not delay .    but my just one shall live by faith ,   and if he draw back I take no pleasure in he .      we be not among those who draw back and perish , but among those who have faith and will possess life .
