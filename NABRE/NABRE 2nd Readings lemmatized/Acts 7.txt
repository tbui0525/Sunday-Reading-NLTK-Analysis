b '   Stephens discourse .     then the high priest ask , be this so ?       and he reply ,    my brother and father , listen . the God of glory appear to our father Abraham while he be in Mesopotamia ,    before he have settle in Haran ,      and say to he , go forth from your land and [ from ] your kinsfolk to the land that I will show you .        so he go forth from the land of the Chaldeans and settle in Haran . and from there , after his father die , he make he migrate to this land where you now dwell .        yet he give he no inheritance in it , not even a foot length , but he do promise to give it to he and his descendant as a possession , even though he be childless .        and God speak thus ,    his descendant shall be alien in a land not their own , where they shall be enslave and oppress for four hundred year ;      but I will bring judgment on the nation they serve , God say , and after that they will come out and worship I in this place .        then he give he the covenant of circumcision , and so he become the father of Isaac , and circumcise he on the eighth day , as Isaac do Jacob , and Jacob the twelve patriarch .      and the patriarch , jealous of Joseph , sell he into slavery in Egypt ; but God be with he        and rescue he from all his affliction . he grant he favor and wisdom before Pharaoh , the king of Egypt , who put he in charge of Egypt and [ of ] his entire household .        then a famine and great affliction strike all Egypt and Canaan , and our ancestor could find no food ;        but when Jacob hear that there be grain in Egypt , he send our ancestor there a first time .        the second time , Joseph make himself know to his brother , and Josephs family become known to Pharaoh .        then Joseph send for his father Jacob , invite he and his whole clan , seventy - five person ;        and Jacob go down to Egypt . and he and our ancestor die        and be bring back to Shechem and place in the tomb that Abraham have purchase for a sum of money from the son of Hamor at Shechem .      when the time draw near for the fulfillment of the promise that God pledge to Abraham , the people have increase and become very numerous in Egypt ,        until another king who know nothing of Joseph come to power [ in Egypt ] .        he deal shrewdly with our people and oppress [ our ] ancestor by force they to expose their infant , that they might not survive .      at this time Moses be bear , and he be extremely beautiful . for three month he be nurse in his father house ;        but when he be expose , Pharaohs daughter adopt he and bring he up as her own son .        Moses be educate [ in ] all the wisdom of the Egyptians and be powerful in his word and deed .      when he be forty year old , he decide to visit his kinsfolk , the Israelites .      when he see one of they treat unjustly , he defend and avenge the oppressed man by strike down the Egyptian .      he assume [ his ] kinsfolk would understand that God be offer they deliverance through he , but they do not understand .       the next day he appear to they as they be fight and try to reconcile they peacefully , say , man , you be brother . why be you harm one another ?      then the one who be harm his neighbor push he aside , say , who appoint you ruler and judge over we ?      be you think of kill I as you kill the Egyptian yesterday ?      Moses flee when he hear this and settle as an alien in the land of Midian , where he become the father of two son .       forty year later , an angel appear to he in the desert near Mount Sinai in the flame of a burn bush .      when Moses see it , he be amazed at the sight , and as he draw near to look at it , the voice of the Lord come ,      I be the God of your father , the God of Abraham , of Isaac , and of Jacob . then Moses , tremble , do not dare to look at it .      but the Lord say to he , remove the sandal from your foot , for the place where you stand be holy ground .      I have witness the affliction of my people in Egypt and have hear their groaning , and I have come down to rescue they . come now , I will send you to Egypt .      this Moses , whom they have reject with the word , who appoint you ruler and judge ? God send as [ both ] ruler and deliverer , through the angel who appear to he in the bush .        this man lead they out , perform wonder and sign in the land of Egypt , at the Red Sea , and in the desert for forty year .        it be this Moses who say to the Israelites , God will raise up for you , from among your own kinsfolk , a prophet like I .        it be he who , in the assembly in the desert , be with the angel who speak to he on Mount Sinai and with our ancestor , and he receive living utterance to hand on to we .      our ancestor be unwilling to obey he ; instead , they push he aside and in their heart turn back to Egypt ,        say to Aaron , make we god who will be our leader . as for that Moses who lead we out of the land of Egypt , we do not know what have happen to he .         so they make a calf in those day , offer sacrifice to the idol , and revel in the work of their hand .      then God turn and hand they over to worship the host of heaven , as it be write in the book of the prophet :   do you bring I sacrifice and offering   for forty year in the desert , o house of Israel ?    no , you take up the tent of Moloch   and the star of [ your ] god Rephan ,   the image that you make to worship . so I shall take you into exile beyond Babylon .     our ancestor have the tent of testimony in the desert just as the one who speak to Moses direct he to make it accord to the pattern he have see .        our ancestor who inherit it bring it with Joshua when they dispossess the nation that God drive out from before our ancestor , up to the time of David ,        who find favor in the sight of God and ask that he might find a dwelling place for the house of Jacob .        but Solomon build a house for he .        yet the most High do not dwell in house make by human hand . as the prophet say :      the heaven be my throne ,   the earth be my footstool . what kind of house can you build for I ?   say the Lord ,   or what be to be my rest place ?    do not my hand make all these thing ?    Conclusion .     you stiff - neck people , uncircumcised in heart and ear , you always oppose the holy Spirit ; you be just like your ancestor .      which of the prophet do your ancestor not persecute ? they put to death those who foretell the coming of the righteous one , whose betrayer and murderer you have now become .        you receive the law as transmit by angel , but you do not observe it .     Stephens Martyrdom .     when they hear this , they be infuriate , and they ground their tooth at he .       but he , fill with the holy Spirit , look up intently to heaven and see the glory of God and Jesus stand at the right hand of God ,        and he say , Behold , I see the heavens open and the Son of Man stand at the right hand of God .      but they cry out in a loud voice , cover their ear ,    and rush upon he together .      they throw he out of the city , and begin to stone he . the witness lay down their cloak at the foot of a young man name Saul .        as they be stone Stephen ,    he call out , Lord Jesus , receive my spirit .        then he fall to his knee and cry out in a loud voice , Lord , do not hold this sin against they ; and when he say this , he fall asleep .
