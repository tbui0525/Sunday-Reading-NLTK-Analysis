b '   if I speak in human and angelic tongue    but do not have love , I be a resounding gong or a clash cymbal .        and if I have the gift of prophecy and comprehend all mystery and all knowledge ; if I have all faith so as to move mountain but do not have love , I be nothing .        if I give away everything I own , and if I hand my body over so that I may boast but do not have love , I gain nothing .       love be patient , love be kind . it be not jealous , [ love ] be not pompous , it be not inflate ,        it be not rude , it do not seek its own interest , it be not quick - temper , it do not brood over injury ,        it do not rejoice over wrongdoing but rejoice with the truth .      it bear all thing , believe all thing , hope all thing , endure all thing .       Love never fail . if there be prophecy , they will be bring to nothing ; if tongue , they will cease ; if knowledge , it will be bring to nothing .      for we know partially and we prophesy partially ,      but when the perfect come , the partial will pass away .      when I be a child , I use to talk as a child , think as a child , reason as a child ; when I become a man , I put aside childish thing .      at present we see indistinctly , as in a mirror , but then face to face . at present I know partially ; then I shall know fully , as I be fully know .         so faith , hope , love remain , these three ;    but the great of these be love .
