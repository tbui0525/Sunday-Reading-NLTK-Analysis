b '     the Presbyter to the choose Lady and to her child whom I love in truth\xe2\x80\x94and not only I but also all who know the truth\xe2\x80\x94      because of the truth that dwell in we and will be with we forever .      Grace , mercy , and peace    will be with we from God the Father and from Jesus Christ the Fathers Son in truth and love .     I rejoice greatly to find some of your child    walk in the truth just as we be command by the Father .        but now , Lady , I ask you , not as though I be write a new commandment but the one we have have from the beginning : let we love one another .        for this be love , that we walk accord to his commandment ;    this be the commandment , as you hear from the beginning , in which you should walk .       many deceiver have go out into the world , those who do not acknowledge Jesus Christ as come in the flesh ; such be the deceitful one and the antichrist .        look to yourself that you    do not lose what we work for but may receive a full recompense .       anyone who be so progressive    as not to remain in the teaching of the Christ do not have God ; whoever remain in the teaching have the Father and the Son .       if anyone come to you and do not bring this doctrine , do not receive he in your house or even greet he ;        for whoever greet he share in his evil work .      although I have much to write to you , I do not intend to use paper and ink . instead , I hope to visit you and to speak face to face so that our joy may be complete .        the child of your choose sister    send you greeting .
