b '   Gods House and People .      rid yourself of all malice and all deceit , insincerity , envy , and all slander ;        like newborn infant , long for pure spiritual milk so that through it you may grow into salvation ,       for you have taste that the Lord be good .        come to he , a live stone ,    reject by human being but choose and precious in the sight of God ,        and , like living stone , let yourself be build    into a spiritual house to be a holy priesthood to offer spiritual sacrifice acceptable to God through Jesus Christ .        for it say in scripture : behold , I be lay a stone in Zion ,   a cornerstone , choose and precious , and whoever believe in it shall not be put to shame .      therefore , its value be for you who have faith , but for those without faith : the stone which the builder reject   have become the cornerstone ,      and a stone that will make people stumble ,   and a rock that will make they fall . they stumble by disobey the word , as be their destiny .       but you be a choose race , a royal priesthood , a holy nation , a people of his own , so that you may announce the praise of he who call you out of darkness into his wonderful light .      once you be no people   but now you be Gods people ; you have not receive mercy   but now you have receive mercy .      Christian Examples .      beloved , I urge you as alien and sojourner    to keep away from worldly desire that wage war against the soul .        maintain good conduct among the Gentiles , so that if they speak of you as evildoer , they may observe your good work and glorify God on the day of visitation . Christian Citizens .        be subject to every human institution for the Lords sake , whether it be to the king as supreme        or to governor as send by he for the punishment of evildoer and the approval of those who do good .      for it be the will of God that by do good you may silence the ignorance of foolish people .      be free , yet without use freedom as a pretext for evil , but as slave of God .        give honor to all , love the community , fear God , honor the king .     Christian Slaves .      slave , be subject to your master with all reverence , not only to those who be good and equitable but also to those who be perverse .        for whenever anyone bear the pain of unjust suffering because of consciousness of God , that be a grace .      but what credit be there if you be patient when beat for do wrong ? but if you be patient when you suffer for do what be good , this be a grace before God .      for to this you have be call , because Christ also suffer    for you , leave you an example that you should follow in his footstep .      he commit no sin ,    and no deceit be find in his mouth .      when he be insult , he return no insult ; when he suffer , he do not threaten ; instead , he hand himself over to the one who judge justly .        he himself bear our sin in his body upon the cross , so that , free from sin , we might live for righteousness . by his wound you have be heal .        for you have go astray like sheep ,    but you have now return to the shepherd and guardian of your soul .
