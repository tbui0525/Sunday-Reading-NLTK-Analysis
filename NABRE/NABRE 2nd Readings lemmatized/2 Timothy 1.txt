II . exhortation to Timothy the gift Timothy have receive .     for this reason , I remind you to stir into flame the gift of God    that you have through the imposition of my hand .        for God do not give we a spirit of cowardice but rather of power and love and self - control .        so do not be ashamed of your testimony to our Lord ,    nor of I , a prisoner for his sake ; but bear your share of hardship for the gospel with the strength that come from God .       he save we and call we to a holy life , not accord to our work but accord to his own design and the grace bestow on we in Christ Jesus before time begin ,        but now make manifest through the appearance of our savior Christ Jesus , who destroy death and bring life and immortality to light through the gospel ,         for which I be appoint preacher and apostle    and teacher .       on this account I be suffer these thing ; but I be not ashamed ,    for I know he in whom I have believe and be confident that he be able to guard what have be entrust to I until that day .      take as your norm the sound word that you hear from I , in the faith and love that be in Christ Jesus .        guard this rich trust with the help of the holy Spirit that dwell within we .     Pauls Suffering .       you know that everyone in Asia desert I , include Phygelus and Hermogenes .       may the Lord grant mercy to the family of Onesiphorus    because he often give I new heart and be not ashamed of my chain .      but when he come to Rome , he promptly search for I and find I .      may the Lord grant he to find mercy from the Lord    on that day . and you know very well the service he render in Ephesus .
