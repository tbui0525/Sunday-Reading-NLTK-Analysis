b '   cause of Division .      where do the war and where do the conflict among you come from ? be it not from your passion    that make war within your member ?        you covet but do not possess . you kill and envy but you can not obtain ; you fight and wage war . you do not possess because you do not ask .      you ask but do not receive , because you ask wrongly , to spend it on your passion .      Adulterers !    do you not know that to be a lover of the world mean enmity with God ? therefore , whoever want to be a lover of the world make himself an enemy of God .        or do you suppose that the scripture speak without meaning when it say , the spirit that he have make to dwell in we tend toward jealousy ?        but he bestow a great grace ; therefore , it say :   God resist the proud ,   but give grace to the humble .      so submit yourself to God . resist the devil , and he will flee from you .        draw near to God , and he will draw near to you . cleanse your hand , you sinner , and purify your heart , you of two mind .        begin to lament , to mourn , to weep . let your laughter be turn into mourning and your joy into dejection .      humble yourself before the Lord and he will exalt you .      do not speak evil of one another , brother . whoever speak evil of a brother or judge his brother speak evil of the law and judge the law .    if you judge the law , you be not a doer of the law but a judge .      there be one lawgiver and judge who be able to save or to destroy . who then be you to judge your neighbor ?   warn against Presumption .        come now , you who say , Today or tomorrow we shall go into such and such a town , spend a year there do business , and make a profit\xe2\x80\x94      you have no idea what your life will be like tomorrow .    you be a puff of smoke that appear briefly and then disappear .        instead you should say , if the Lord will it ,    we shall live to do this or that .      but now you be boast in your arrogance . all such boasting be evil .       so for one who know the right thing to do and do not do it , it be a sin .
