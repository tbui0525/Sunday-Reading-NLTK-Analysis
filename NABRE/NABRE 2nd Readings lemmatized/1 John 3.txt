b '     see what love the Father have bestow on we that we may be call the child of God . yet so we be . the reason the world do not know we be that it do not know he .        beloved , we be Gods child now ; what we shall be have not yet be reveal . we do know that when it be reveal    we shall be like he , for we shall see he as he be .        everyone who have this hope base on he make himself pure , as he be pure .     avoid sin .     everyone who commit sin commit lawlessness , for sin be lawlessness .        you know that he be reveal to take away sin , and in he there be no sin .        no one who remain in he sin ; no one who sin have see he or know he .      child , let no one deceive you . the person who act in righteousness be righteous , just as he be righteous .      whoever sin belong to the devil , because the devil have sin from the beginning . indeed , the Son of God be reveal to destroy the work of the devil .        no one who be beget by God commit sin , because Gods seed remain in he ; he can not sin because he be beget by God .        in this way , the child of God and the child of the devil be make plain ; no one who fail to act in righteousness belong to God , nor anyone who do not love his brother .       for this be the message you have hear from the beginning : we should love one another ,        unlike Cain who belong to the evil one and slaughter his brother . why do he slaughter he ? because his own work be evil , and those of his brother righteous .        do not be amazed , [ then , ] brother , if the world hate you .        we know that we have pass from death to life because we love our brother . whoever do not love remain in death .        everyone who hate his brother be a murderer , and you know that no murderer have eternal life remain in he .        the way we come to know love be that he lay down his life for we ; so we ought to lay down our life for our brother .        if someone who have worldly mean see a brother in need and refuse he compassion , how can the love of God remain in he ?        child , let we love not in word or speech but in deed and truth .   confidence before God .        [ now ] this be how we shall know that we    belong to the truth and reassure our heart before he      in whatever our heart condemn , for God be great than our heart and know everything .      beloved , if [ our ] heart do not condemn we , we have confidence in God      and receive from he whatever we ask , because we keep his commandment and do what please he .        and his commandment be this : we should believe in the name of his Son , Jesus Christ , and love one another just as he command we .        those who keep his commandment remain in he , and he in they , and the way we know that he remain in we be from the Spirit that he give we .
