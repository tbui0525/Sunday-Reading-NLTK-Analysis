b '   Heavenly Priesthood of Jesus .      the main point of what have be say be this : we have such a high priest , who have take his seat at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in heaven ,        a minister of the sanctuary    and of the true tabernacle that the Lord , not man , set up .        now every high priest be appoint to offer gift and sacrifice ; thus the necessity for this one also to have something to offer .        if then he be on earth , he would not be a priest , since there be those who offer gift accord to the law .        they worship in a copy and shadow of the heavenly sanctuary , as Moses be warn when he be about to erect the tabernacle . for he say , see that you make everything accord to the pattern show you on the mountain .        now he have obtain so much more excellent a ministry as he be mediator of a well covenant , enact on well promise .   Old and New Covenants .        for if that first covenant have be faultless , no place would have be seek for a second one .      but he find fault with they and say :   behold , the day be come , say the Lord ,    when I will conclude a new covenant with the house of Israel and the house of Judah .   it will not be like the covenant I make with their father   the day I take they by the hand to lead they forth from the land of Egypt ; for they do not stand by my covenant   and I ignore they , say the Lord .   but this be the covenant I will establish with the house of Israel   after those day , say the Lord : I will put my law in their mind   and I will write they upon their heart . I will be their God ,   and they shall be my people .    and they shall not teach , each one his fellow citizen   and kinsman , say , know the Lord , for all shall know I ,   from least to great .   for I will forgive their evildoing   and remember their sin no more .       when he speak of a new covenant , he declare the first one obsolete . and what have become obsolete and have grow old be close to disappear .
