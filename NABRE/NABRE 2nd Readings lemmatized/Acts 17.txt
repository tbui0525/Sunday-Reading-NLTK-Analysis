b '   Paul in Thessalonica .     when they take the road through Amphipolis and Apollonia , they reach Thessalonica , where there be a synagogue of the Jews .        follow his usual custom , Paul join they , and for three sabbath he enter into discussion with they from the scripture ,      expound and demonstrate that the Messiah have to suffer and rise from the dead , and that this be the Messiah , Jesus , whom I proclaim to you .        some of they be convince and join Paul and Silas ; so , too , a great number of Greeks who be worshiper , and not a few of the prominent woman .      but the Jews become jealous and recruit some worthless man loiter in the public square , form a mob , and set the city in turmoil . they march on the house of Jason ,    intend to bring they before the people assembly .       when they could not find they , they drag Jason and some of the brother before the city magistrate , shout , these people who have be create a disturbance all over the world have now come here ,      and Jason have welcome they .    they all act in opposition to the decree of Caesar and claim instead that there be another king , Jesus .        they stir up the crowd and the city magistrate who , upon hear these charge ,      take a surety payment from Jason and the other before release they .    Paul in Beroea .     the brother immediately send Paul and Silas to Beroea during the night . upon arrival they go to the synagogue of the Jews .      these Jews be more fair - minded than those in Thessalonica , for they receive the word with all willingness and examine the scripture daily to determine whether these thing be so .        many of they become believer , as do not a few of the influential greek woman and man .      but when the Jews of Thessalonica learn that the word of God have now be proclaim by Paul in Beroea also , they come there too to cause a commotion and stir up the crowd .      so the brother at once send Paul on his way to the seacoast , while Silas and Timothy remain behind .        after Pauls escort have take he to Athens , they come away with instruction for Silas and Timothy to join he as soon as possible . Paul in Athens .        while Paul be wait for they in Athens , he grow exasperate at the sight of the city full of idol .      so he debate in the synagogue with the Jews and with the worshiper , and daily in the public square with whoever happen to be there .      even some of the epicurean and stoic philosopher    engage he in discussion . some ask , what be this scavenger try to say ? other say , he sound like a promoter of foreign deity , because he be preach about Jesus and Resurrection .      they take he and lead he to the Areopagus    and say , may we learn what this new teaching be that you speak of ?        for you bring some strange notion to our ear ; we should like to know what these thing mean .      now all the Athenians as well as the foreigner reside there use their time for nothing else but tell or hear something new .    Pauls Speech at the Areopagus .     then Paul stand up at the Areopagus and say :   you Athenians , I see that in every respect you be very religious .      for as I walk around look carefully at your shrine , I even discover an altar inscribe , to an unknown God .    what therefore you unknowingly worship , I proclaim to you .      the God who make the world and all that be in it , the Lord of heaven and earth , do not dwell in sanctuary make by human hand ,        nor be he serve by human hand because he need anything . rather it be he who give to everyone life and breath and everything .      he make from one    the whole human race to dwell on the entire surface of the earth , and he fix the order season and the boundary of their region ,      so that people might seek God , even perhaps grope for he and find he , though indeed he be not far from any one of we .        for in he we live and move and have our being ,    as even some of your poet have say , for we too be his offspring .      since therefore we be the offspring of God , we ought not to think that the divinity be like an image fashion from gold , silver , or stone by human art and imagination .        God have overlook the time of ignorance , but now he demand that all people everywhere repent      because he have establish a day on which he will judge the world with justice through a man he have appoint , and he have provide confirmation for all by raise he from the dead .      when they hear about resurrection of the dead , some begin to scoff , but other say , we should like to hear you on this some other time .      and so Paul leave they .      but some do join he , and become believer . among they be Dionysius , a member of the Court of the Areopagus , a woman name Damaris , and other with they .
