b '    for I want you to know how great a struggle I be have for you and for those in Laodicea    and all who have not see I face to face ,      that their heart may be encourage as they be bring together in love , to have all the richness of fully assure understanding , for the knowledge of the mystery of God , Christ ,        in whom be hide all the treasure of wisdom and knowledge .     a General Admonition .     I say this so that no one may deceive you by specious argument .        for even if I be absent in the flesh , yet I be with you in spirit , rejoice as I observe your good order and the firmness of your faith in Christ .        so , as you receive Christ Jesus the Lord , walk in he ,      root in he and build upon he and establish in the faith as you be teach , abound in thanksgiving .        see to it that no one captivate you with an empty , seductive philosophy accord to human tradition , accord to the elemental power of the world    and not accord to Christ .     Sovereign Role of Christ .      for in he dwell the whole fullness of the deity    bodily ,      and you share in this fullness in he , who be the head of every principality and power .       in he    you be also circumcise with a circumcision not administer by hand , by strip off the carnal body , with the circumcision of Christ .      you be bury with he in baptism , in which you be also raise with he through faith in the power of God , who raise he from the dead .         and even when you be dead [ in ] transgression and the uncircumcision of your flesh , he bring you to life along with he , having forgive we all our transgression ;       obliterate the bond against we , with its legal claim , which be oppose to we , he also remove it from our midst , nail it to the cross ;        despoil the principality and the power , he make a public spectacle of they ,    lead they away in triumph by it .     practice contrary to Faith .      let no one , then , pass judgment on you in matter of food and drink or with regard to a festival or new moon or sabbath .        these be shadow of thing to come ; the reality belong to Christ .        let no one disqualify you , delight in self - abasement and worship of angel , take his stand on vision ,    inflate without reason by his fleshly mind ,        and not hold closely to the head , from whom the whole body , support and hold together by its ligament and bond , achieve the growth that come from God .      if you die with Christ to the elemental power of the world , why do you submit to regulation as if you be still live in the world ?      do not handle ! do not taste ! do not touch !      these be all thing destine to perish with use ; they accord with human precept and teaching .        while they have a semblance of wisdom in rigor of devotion and self - abasement [ and ] severity to the body , they be of no value against gratification of the flesh .
