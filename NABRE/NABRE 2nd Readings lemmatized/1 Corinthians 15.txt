b '    chapter 15   the Gospel Teaching .      now I be remind you , brother , of the gospel I preach to you , which you indeed receive and in which you also stand .      through it you be also be save , if you hold fast to the word I preach to you , unless you believe in vain .       for I hand on to you as of first importance what I also receive : that Christ die for our sin in accordance with the scripture ;        that he be bury ; that he be raise on the third day in accordance with the scripture ;        that he appear to Cephas , then to the Twelve .        after that , he appear to more than five hundred brother at once , most of whom be still live , though some have fall asleep .      after that he appear to James , then to all the apostle .      last of all , as to one bear abnormally , he appear to I .        for I be the least    of the apostle , not fit to be call an apostle , because I persecute the church of God .        but by the grace of God I be what I be , and his grace to I have not be ineffective . indeed , I have toil hard than all of they ; not I , however , but the grace of God [ that be ] with I .      therefore , whether it be I or they , so we preach and so you believe . B. the Resurrection of the Dead result of Denial .        but if Christ be preach as raise from the dead , how can some among you say there be no resurrection of the dead ?      if there be no resurrection of the dead , then neither have Christ be raise .        and if Christ have not be raise , then empty [ too ] be our preaching ; empty , too , your faith .      then we be also false witness to God , because we testify against God that he raise Christ , whom he do not raise if in fact the dead be not raise .        for if the dead be not raise , neither have Christ be raise ,      and if Christ have not be raise ,    your faith be vain ; you be still in your sin .      then those who have fall asleep in Christ have perish .      if for this life only we have hope in Christ , we be the most pitiable people of all . Christ the Firstfruits .         but now Christ have be raise from the dead , the firstfruit    of those who have fall asleep .       for since death come through a human being , the resurrection of the dead come also through a human being .      for just as in Adam all die , so too in Christ shall all be bring to life ,        but each one in proper order : Christ the firstfruit ; then , at his coming , those who belong to Christ ;        then come the end ,    when he hand over the kingdom to his God and Father , when he have destroy every sovereignty and every authority and power .        for he must reign until he have put all his enemy under his foot .         the last enemy    to be destroy be death ,       for he subject everything under his foot .    but when it say that everything have be subject , it be clear that it exclude the one who subject everything to he .      when everything be subject to he , then the Son himself will [ also ] be subject to the one who subject everything to he , so that God may be all in all .   practical argument .        otherwise , what will people accomplish by have themselves baptize for the dead ?    if the dead be not raise at all , then why be they have themselves baptize for they ?      moreover , why be we endanger ourselves all the time ?        every day I face death ; I swear it by the pride in you [ brother ] that I have in Christ Jesus our Lord .        if at Ephesus I fight with beast , so to speak , what benefit be it to I ? if the dead be not raise : let we eat and drink ,   for tomorrow we die .      do not be lead astray : bad company corrupt good moral .     become sober as you ought and stop sin . for some have no knowledge of God ; I say this to your shame .     C. the Manner of the Resurrection     but someone may say , how be the dead raise ? with what kind of body will they come back ?    the Resurrection Body .      you fool ! what you sow be not bring to life unless it die .        and what you sow be not the body that be to be but a bare kernel of wheat , perhaps , or of some other kind ;       but God give it a body as he choose , and to each of the seed its own body .       not all flesh be the same , but there be one kind for human being , another kind of flesh for animal , another kind of flesh for bird , and another for fish .      there be both heavenly body and earthly body , but the brightness of the heavenly be one kind and that of the earthly another .      the brightness of the sun be one kind , the brightness of the moon another , and the brightness of the star another . for star differ from star in brightness .      so also be the resurrection of the dead . it be sow corruptible ; it be raise incorruptible .      it be sow dishonorable ; it be raise glorious . it be sow weak ; it be raise powerful .        it be sow a natural body ; it be raise a spiritual body . if there be a natural body , there be also a spiritual one .     so , too , it be write , the first man , Adam ,    become a living being , the last Adam a life - give spirit .        but the spiritual be not first ; rather the natural and then the spiritual .      the first man be from the earth , earthly ; the second man , from heaven .      as be the earthly one , so also be the earthly , and as be the heavenly one , so also be the heavenly .      just as we have bear the image of the earthly one , we shall also bear the image    of the heavenly one .     the Resurrection Event .      this I declare , brother : flesh and blood can not inherit the kingdom of God , nor do corruption    inherit incorruption .         behold , I tell you a mystery . we shall not all fall asleep , but we will all be change ,        in an instant , in the blink of an eye , at the last trumpet . for the trumpet will sound , the dead will be raise incorruptible , and we shall be change .        for that which be corruptible must clothe itself with incorruptibility , and that which be mortal must clothe itself with immortality .         and when this which be corruptible clothe itself with incorruptibility and this which be mortal clothe itself with immortality , then the word that be write shall come about :   death be swallow up in victory .   where , o death , be your victory ? where , o death , be your sting ?      the sting of death be sin ,    and the power of sin be the law .        but thank be to God who give we the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ .      therefore , my beloved brother , be firm , steadfast , always fully devoted to the work of the Lord , know that in the Lord your labor be not in vain .
