b '    when I come to you , brother , proclaim the mystery of God ,    I do not come with sublimity of word or of wisdom .        for I resolve to know nothing while I be with you except Jesus Christ , and he crucify .        I come to you in weakness    and fear and much trembling ,      and my message and my proclamation be not with persuasive [ word of ] wisdom ,    but with a demonstration of spirit and power ,        so that your faith might rest not on human wisdom but on the power of God .   the true Wisdom .        yet we do speak a wisdom to those who be mature , but not a wisdom of this age , nor of the ruler of this age who be pass away .      rather , we speak Gods wisdom ,    mysterious , hide , which God predetermine before the age for our glory ,      and which none of the ruler of this age    know ; for , if they have know it , they would not have crucify the Lord of glory .      but as it be write : what eye have not see , and ear have not hear ,   and what have not enter the human heart ,   what God have prepare for those who love he ,       this God have reveal to we through the Spirit . for the Spirit scrutinize everything , even the depth of God .      among human being , who know what pertain to a person except the spirit of the person that be within ? similarly , no one know what pertain to God except the Spirit of God .      we have not receive the spirit of the world but the Spirit that be from God , so that we may understand the thing freely give we by God .      and we speak about they not with word teach by human wisdom , but with word teach by the Spirit , describe spiritual reality in spiritual term .      now the natural person    do not accept what pertain to the Spirit of God , for to he it be foolishness , and he can not understand it , because it be judge spiritually .      the spiritual person , however , can judge everything but be not subject to judgment    by anyone .     for who have know the mind of the Lord , so as to counsel he ? but we have the mind of Christ .
