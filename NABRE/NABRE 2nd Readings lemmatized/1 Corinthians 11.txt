b '    be imitator of I , as I be of Christ .      I praise you because you remember I in everything and hold fast to the tradition , just as I hand they on to you .     a. Womens Headdresses   Man and Woman .     but I want you to know that Christ be the head of every man , and a husband the head of his wife ,    and God the head of Christ .         any man who pray or prophesy with his head cover bring shame upon his head .      but any woman who pray or prophesy with her head unveil bring shame upon her head , for it be one and the same thing as if she have have her head shave .      for if a woman do not have her head veil , she may as well have her hair cut off . but if it be shameful for a woman to have her hair cut off or her head shave , then she should wear a veil .      a man , on the other hand , should not cover his head , because he be the image and glory of God , but woman be the glory of man .        for man do not come from woman , but woman from man ;        nor be man create for woman , but woman for man ;        for this reason a woman should have a sign of authority    on her head , because of the angel .       woman be not independent of man or man of woman in the Lord .        for just as woman come from man , so man be bear of woman ; but all thing be from God .       Judge for yourself : be it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head unveil ?      do not nature itself teach you that if a man wear his hair long it be a disgrace to he ,      whereas if a woman have long hair it be her glory , because long hair have be give [ her ] for a covering ?      but if anyone be inclined to be argumentative , we do not have such a custom , nor do the church of God .    B. the Lords Supper   An abuse at Corinth .     in give this instruction , I do not praise the fact that your meeting be do more harm than good .      first of all , I hear that when you meet as a church there be division among you , and to a degree I believe it ;        there have to be faction among you in order that [ also ] those who be approve among you may become know .        when you meet in one place , then , it be not to eat the Lords supper ,      for in eating , each one go ahead with his own supper , and one go hungry while another get drunk .      do you not have house in which you can eat and drink ? or do you show contempt for the church of God and make those who have nothing feel ashamed ? what can I say to you ? shall I praise you ? in this matter I do not praise you .     Tradition of the Institution .      for I receive from the Lord what I also hand on to you ,    that the Lord Jesus , on the night he be hand over , take bread ,      and , after he have give thank , break it and say , this be my body that be for you . do this in remembrance of I .      in the same way also the cup , after supper , say , this cup be the new covenant in my blood . do this , as often as you drink it , in remembrance of I .        for as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup , you proclaim the death of the Lord until he come .     therefore whoever eat the bread or drink the cup of the Lord unworthily will have to answer for the body and blood of the Lord .        a person should examine himself ,    and so eat the bread and drink the cup .      for anyone who eat and drink without discern the body , eat and drink judgment    on himself .      that be why many among you be ill and infirm , and a considerable number be die .      if we discern ourselves , we would not be under judgment ;      but since we be judge by [ the ] Lord , we be be discipline so that we may not be condemn along with the world .      therefore , my brother , when you come together to eat , wait for one another .      if anyone be hungry , he should eat at home , so that your meeting may not result in judgment . the other matter I shall set in order when I come .
