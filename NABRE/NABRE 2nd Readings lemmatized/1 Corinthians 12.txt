b ' chapter 12 Unity and Variety .     now in regard to spiritual gift , brother , I do not want you to be unaware .       you know how , when you be pagan , you be constantly attract and lead away to mute idol .        therefore , I tell you that nobody speak by the spirit of God say , Jesus be accurse . and no one can say , Jesus be Lord , except by the holy Spirit .       there be different kind of spiritual gift but the same Spirit ;        there be different form of service but the same Lord ;      there be different working but the same God who produce all of they in everyone .      to each individual the manifestation of the Spirit be give for some benefit .      to one be give through the Spirit the expression of wisdom ; to another the expression of knowledge accord to the same Spirit ;        to another faith by the same Spirit ; to another gift of healing by the one Spirit ;      to another mighty deed ; to another prophecy ; to another discernment of spirit ; to another variety of tongue ; to another interpretation of tongue .        but one and the same Spirit produce all of these , distribute they individually to each person as he wish .   one body , many Parts .        as a body be one though it have many part , and all the part of the body , though many , be one body , so also Christ .        for in one Spirit we be all baptize into one body , whether Jews or Greeks , slave or free person , and we be all give to drink of one Spirit .      now the body be not a single part , but many .      if a foot should say , because I be not a hand I do not belong to the body , it do not for this reason belong any less to the body .      or if an ear should say , because I be not an eye I do not belong to the body , it do not for this reason belong any less to the body .      if the whole body be an eye , where would the hearing be ? if the whole body be hear , where would the sense of smell be ?      but as it be , God place the part , each one of they , in the body as he intend .      if they be all one part , where would the body be ?      but as it be , there be many part , yet one body .      the eye can not say to the hand , I do not need you , nor again the head to the foot , I do not need you .      indeed , the part of the body that seem to be weak be all the more necessary ,      and those part of the body that we consider less honorable we surround with great honor , and our less presentable part be treat with great propriety ,      whereas our more presentable part do not need this . but God have so construct the body as to give great honor to a part that be without it ,      so that there may be no division in the body , but that the part may have the same concern for one another .      if [ one ] part suffer , all the part suffer with it ; if one part be honor , all the part share its joy . application to Christ .        now you be Christs body , and individually part of it .        some people God have designate in the church to be , first , apostle ;    second , prophet ; third , teacher ; then , mighty deed ; then , gift of healing , assistance , administration , and variety of tongue .        be all apostle ? be all prophet ? be all teacher ? do all work mighty deed ?      do all have gift of healing ? do all speak in tongue ? do all interpret ?      strive eagerly for the great spiritual gift . the way of Love .   but I shall show you a still more excellent way .
