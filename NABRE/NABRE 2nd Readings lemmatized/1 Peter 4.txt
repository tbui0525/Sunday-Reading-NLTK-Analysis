b '   Christian Restraint .      therefore , since Christ suffer in the flesh , arm yourself also with the same attitude ( for whoever suffer in the flesh have break with sin ) ,      so as not to spend what remain of one life in the flesh on human desire , but on the will of God .      for the time that have pass be sufficient for do what the Gentiles like to do : live in debauchery , evil desire , drunkenness , orgy , carousing , and wanton idolatry .        they be surprised that you do not plunge into the same swamp of profligacy , and they vilify you ;      but they will give an account to he who stand ready to judge the living and the dead .        for this be why the gospel be preach even to the dead    that , though condemn in the flesh in human estimation , they might live in the spirit in the estimation of God . Christian Charity .        the end of all thing be at hand . therefore , be serious and sober for prayer .       above all , let your love for one another be intense , because love cover a multitude of sin .        be hospitable to one another without complain .        as each one have receive a gift , use it to serve one another as good steward of Gods varied grace .        whoever preach , let it be with the word of God ; whoever serve , let it be with the strength that God supply , so that in all thing God may be glorify through Jesus Christ ,    to whom belong glory and dominion forever and ever . amen .    Trial of Persecution .        beloved , do not be surprised that a trial by fire be occur among you , as if something strange be happen to you .        but rejoice to the extent that you share in the suffering of Christ , so that when his glory be reveal you may also rejoice exultantly .        if you be insult for the name of Christ , bless be you , for the Spirit of glory and of God rest upon you .        but let no one among you be make to suffer as a murderer , a thief , an evildoer , or as an intriguer .      but whoever be make to suffer as a Christian should not be ashamed but glorify God because of the name .      for it be time for the judgment to begin with the household of God ; if it begin with we , how will it end for those who fail to obey the gospel of God ?      and if the righteous one be barely save ,   where will the godless and the sinner appear ?      as a result , those who suffer in accord with Gods will hand their soul over to a faithful creator as they do good .
