b '   God our Father .      therefore , since we be surround by so great a cloud of witness , let we rid ourselves of every burden and sin that cling to we    and persevere in run the race that lie before we      while keep our eye fix on Jesus , the leader and perfecter of faith . for the sake of the joy that lay before he he endure the cross , despise its shame , and have take his seat at the right of the throne of God .        consider how he endure such opposition from sinner , in order that you may not grow weary and lose heart .      in your struggle against sin you have not yet resist to the point of shed blood .      you have also forget the exhortation address to you as son : my son , do not disdain the discipline of the Lord    or lose heart when reprove by he ;   for whom the Lord love , he discipline ;   he scourge every son he acknowledge .     endure your trial as discipline ; God treat you as son . for what son be there whom his father do not discipline ?        if you be without discipline , in which all have share , you be not son but bastard .      besides this , we have have our earthly father to discipline we , and we respect they . should we not [ then ] submit all the more to the Father of spirit and live ?        they discipline we for a short time as seem right to they , but he do so for our benefit , in order that we may share his holiness .      at the time , all discipline seem a cause not for joy but for pain , yet later it bring the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who be train by it .      so strengthen your droop hand and your weak knee .        make straight path for your foot , that what be lame may not be dislocate but heal .     penalty of Disobedience .      strive for peace with everyone , and for that holiness without which no one will see the Lord .       see to it that no one be deprive of the grace of God , that no bitter root spring up and cause trouble , through which many may become defile ,        that no one be an immoral or profane person like Esau , who sell his birthright for a single meal .        for you know that later , when he want to inherit his father blessing , he be reject because he find no opportunity to change his mind , even though he seek the blessing with tear .       you have not approach that which could be touch     and a blaze fire and gloomy darkness and storm      and a trumpet blast and a voice speak word such that those who hear beg that no message be far address to they ,        for they could not bear to hear the command : if even an animal touch the mountain , it shall be stone .        indeed , so fearful be the spectacle that Moses say , I be terrified and tremble .        no , you have approach Mount Zion and the city of the live God , the heavenly Jerusalem , and countless angel in festal gathering ,        and the assembly of the firstborn enrol in heaven ,    and God the judge of all , and the spirit of the just make perfect ,        and Jesus , the mediator of a new covenant , and the sprinkled blood that speak more eloquently    than that of Abel .      see that you do not reject the one who speak . for if they do not escape when they refuse the one who warn they on earth , how much more in our case if we turn away from the one who warn from heaven .        his voice shake the earth at that time , but now he have promise , I will once more shake not only earth but heaven .        that phrase , once more , point to [ the ] removal of shake , create thing , so that what be unshaken may remain .        therefore , we who be receive the unshakable kingdom should have gratitude , with which we should offer worship pleasing to God in reverence and awe .        for our God be a consume fire .
