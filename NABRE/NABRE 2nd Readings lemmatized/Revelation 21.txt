b '   the New Heaven and the New Earth .      then I see a new heaven and a new earth . the former heaven and the former earth have pass away , and the sea be no more .        I also see the holy city , a new Jerusalem ,    come down out of heaven from God , prepare as a bride adorn for her husband .        I hear a loud voice from the throne say , behold , Gods dwelling be with the human race .    he will dwell with they and they will be his people    and God himself will always be with they [ as their God ] .        he will wipe every tear from their eye , and there shall be no more death or mourning , wail or pain , [ for ] the old order have pass away .      the one who sit on the throne    say , Behold , I make all thing new . then he say , write these word down , for they be trustworthy and true .        he say to I , they be accomplish .    I [ be ] the alpha and the Omega , the beginning and the end . to the thirsty I will give a gift from the spring of life - give water .        the victor    will inherit these gift , and I shall be his God , and he will be my son .        but as for coward ,    the unfaithful , the depraved , murderer , the unchaste , sorcerer , idol - worshiper , and deceiver of every sort , their lot be in the burn pool of fire and sulfur , which be the second death .   the New Jerusalem .        one of the seven angel who hold the seven bowl fill with the seven last plague come and say to I , come here . I will show you the bride , the wife of the Lamb .        he take I in spirit to a great , high mountain and show I the holy city Jerusalem come down out of heaven from God .        it gleam with the splendor of God . its radiance be like that of a precious stone , like jasper , clear as crystal .        it have a massive , high wall , with twelve gate where twelve angel be station and on which name be inscribe , [ the name ] of the twelve tribe of the Israelites .      there be three gate face east , three north , three south , and three west .        the wall of the city have twelve course of stone as its foundation , on which be inscribe the twelve name of the twelve apostle    of the Lamb .       the one who speak to I hold a gold measure rod to measure the city , its gate , and its wall .      the city be square , its length the same as [ also ] its width . he measure the city with the rod and find it fifteen hundred mile    in length and width and height .      he also measure its wall : one hundred and forty - four cubit    accord to the standard unit of measurement the angel use .       the wall be construct of jasper , while the city be pure gold , clear as glass .      the foundation of the city wall be decorate with every precious stone ; the first course of stone be jasper , the second sapphire , the third chalcedony , the fourth emerald ,        the fifth sardonyx , the sixth carnelian , the seventh chrysolite , the eighth beryl , the ninth topaz , the tenth chrysoprase , the eleventh hyacinth , and the twelfth amethyst .      the twelve gate be twelve pearl , each of the gate make from a single pearl ; and the street of the city be of pure gold , transparent as glass .       I see no temple in the city , for its temple be the Lord God almighty and the Lamb .       the city have no need of sun or moon to shine on it ,    for the glory of God give it light , and its lamp be the Lamb .      the nation will walk by its light ,    and to it the king of the earth will bring their treasure .        during the day its gate will never be shut , and there will be no night there .      the treasure and wealth of the nation will be bring there ,      but nothing unclean will enter it , nor any[one ] who do abominable thing or tell lie . only those will enter whose name be write in the Lambs book of life .
