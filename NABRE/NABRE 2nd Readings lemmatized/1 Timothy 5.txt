b '      do not rebuke an old man , but appeal to he as a father . treat young man as brother ,        old woman as mother , and young woman as sister with complete purity .    Rules for Widows .     honor widow who be truly widow .      but if a widow have child or grandchild , let these first learn to perform their religious duty to their own family and to make recompense to their parent , for this be pleasing to God .      the real widow , who be all alone , have set her hope on God and continue in supplication and prayer night and day .        but the one who be self - indulgent be dead while she live .      Command this , so that they may be irreproachable .      and whoever do not provide for relative and especially family member have deny the faith and be bad than an unbeliever .     let a widow be enrol if she be not less than sixty year old , marry only once ,      with a reputation for good work , namely , that she have raise child , practice hospitality , wash the foot of the holy one , help those in distress , involve herself in every good work .        but exclude young widow , for when their sensuality estrange they from Christ , they want to marry      and will incur condemnation for break their first pledge .      and furthermore , they learn to be idler , go about from house to house , and not only idler but gossip and busybody as well , talk about thing that ought not to be mention .        so I would like young widow to marry , have child , and manage a home , so as to give the adversary no pretext for malign we .        for some have already turn away to follow Satan .      if any woman believer    have widow relative , she must assist they ; the church be not to be burden , so that it will be able to help those who be truly widow . rule for Presbyters .        Presbyters who preside well deserve double honor , especially those who toil in preach and teaching .        for the scripture say , you shall not muzzle an ox when it be threshing , and , a worker deserve his pay .        do not accept an accusation against a presbyter unless it be support by two or three witness .        Reprimand publicly those who do sin , so that the rest also will be afraid .        I charge you before God and Christ Jesus and the elect angel to keep these rule without prejudice , do nothing out of favoritism .      do not lay hand too readily on anyone , and do not share in another sin . keep yourself pure .        stop drink only water , but have a little wine for the sake of your stomach and your frequent illness .     some people sin be public , precede they to judgment ; but other people be follow by their sin .      similarly , good work be also public ; and even those that be not can not remain hidden .
