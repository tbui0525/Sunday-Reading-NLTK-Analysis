b '    after this I hear what sound like the loud voice of a great multitude in heaven , say :   Alleluia !   Salvation , glory , and might belong to our God ,    for true and just be his judgment . he have condemn the great harlot   who corrupt the earth with her harlotry . he have avenge on she the blood of his servant .      they say a second time : Alleluia ! smoke will rise from she forever and ever .      the twenty - four elder and the four live creature fall down and worship God who sit on the throne , say , amen . Alleluia . the Victory Song .        a voice come from the throne say : praise our God , all you his servant ,   [ and ] you who revere he , small and great .      then I hear something like the sound of a great multitude or the sound of rush water or mighty peal of thunder , as they say :   Alleluia ! the Lord have establish his reign ,   [ our ] God , the almighty .   let we rejoice and be glad   and give he glory . for the wedding day of the Lamb    have come ,   his bride have make herself ready .    she be allow to wear   a bright , clean linen garment .   ( the linen represent the righteous deed of the holy one . )      then the angel say to I , write this : bless    be those who have be call to the wedding feast of the Lamb . and he say to I , these word be true ; they come from God .        I fall at his foot to worship he . but he say to I , do not ! I be a fellow servant of your and of your brother who bear witness to Jesus . worship God .    Witness to Jesus be the spirit of prophecy .     the King of king .      then I see the heavens open , and there be a white horse ; its rider be [ call ] faithful and true . he judge and wage war in righteousness .        his eye be [ like ] a fiery flame , and on his head be many diadem . he have a name    inscribe that no one know except himself .        he wear a cloak that have be dip in    blood , and his name be call the Word of God .        the army of heaven follow he , mount on white horse and wear clean white linen .        out of his mouth come a sharp sword to strike the nation . he will rule they with an iron rod , and he himself will tread out in the wine press    the wine of the fury and wrath of God the almighty .        he have a name write on his cloak and on his thigh , king of king and Lord of lord .       then I see an angel stand on the sun . he cry out [ in ] a loud voice to all the bird fly high overhead , come here . gather for god great feast ,      to eat the flesh of king , the flesh of military officer , and the flesh of warrior , the flesh of horse and of their rider , and the flesh of all , free and slave , small and great .        then I see the beast and the king of the earth and their army gather to fight against the one ride the horse and against his army .      the beast be catch and with it the false prophet    who have perform in its sight the sign by which he lead astray those who have accept the mark of the beast and those who have worship its image . the two be throw alive into the fiery pool burn with sulfur .        the rest be kill by the sword that come out of the mouth of the one ride the horse , and all the bird gorge themselves on their flesh .
