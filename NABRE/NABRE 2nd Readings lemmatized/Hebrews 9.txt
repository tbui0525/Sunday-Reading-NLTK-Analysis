b '   the worship of the First Covenant .      now [ even ] the first covenant have regulation for worship and an earthly sanctuary .      for a tabernacle be construct , the outer one ,    in which be the lampstand , the table , and the bread of offering ; this be call the Holy Place .         behind the second veil be the tabernacle call the Holy of Holies ,        in which be the gold altar of incense    and the ark of the covenant entirely cover with gold . in it be the gold jar contain the manna , the staff of Aaron that have sprout , and the tablet of the covenant .         above it be the cherubim of glory overshadow the place of expiation . now be not the time to speak of these in detail .      with these arrangement for worship , the priest , in perform their service ,    go into the outer tabernacle repeatedly ,        but the high priest alone go into the inner one once a year , not without blood    that he offer for himself and for the sin of the people .        in this way the holy Spirit show that the way into the sanctuary have not yet be reveal while the outer tabernacle still have its place .      this be a symbol of the present time ,    in which gift and sacrifice be offer that can not perfect the worshiper in conscience      but only in matter of food and drink and various ritual washing : regulation concern the flesh , impose until the time of the new order .     Sacrifice of Jesus .      but when Christ come as high priest of the good thing that have come to be ,    pass through the great and more perfect tabernacle not make by hand , that is , not belong to this creation ,        he enter once for all into the sanctuary , not with the blood of goat and calf but with his own blood , thus obtain eternal redemption .        for if the blood of goat and bull and the sprinkling of a heifer ashe    can sanctify those who be defile so that their flesh be cleanse ,        how much more will the blood of Christ , who through the eternal spirit    offer himself unblemished to God , cleanse our conscience from dead work to worship the live God .       for this reason he be mediator of a new covenant : since a death have take place for deliverance from transgression under the first covenant , those who be call may receive the promise eternal inheritance .         now where there be a will , the death of the testator must be establish .      for a will take effect only at death ; it have no force while the testator be alive .      thus not even the first covenant be inaugurate without blood .       when every commandment have be proclaim by Moses to all the people accord to the law , he take the blood of calf [ and goat ] , together with water and crimson wool and hyssop , and sprinkle both the book itself and all the people ,        say , this be the blood of the covenant which God have enjoin upon you .        in the same way , he sprinkle also the tabernacle    and all the vessel of worship with blood .         accord to the law almost everything be purify by blood ,    and without the shedding of blood there be no forgiveness .      therefore , it be necessary for the copy of the heavenly thing to be purify by these rite , but the heavenly thing themselves by well sacrifice than these .        for Christ do not enter into a sanctuary make by hand , a copy of the true one , but heaven itself , that he might now appear before God on our behalf .        not that he might offer himself repeatedly , as the high priest enter each year into the sanctuary with blood that be not his own ;      if that be so , he would have have to suffer repeatedly from the foundation of the world . but now once for all he have appear at the end of the age    to take away sin by his sacrifice .        just as it be appoint that human being die once , and after this the judgment ,        so also Christ , offer once to take away the sin of many ,    will appear a second time , not to take away sin but to bring salvation to those who eagerly await he .
