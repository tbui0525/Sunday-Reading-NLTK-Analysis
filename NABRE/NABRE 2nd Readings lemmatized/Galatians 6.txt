b '   Life in the Community of Christ .      brother , even if a person be catch in some transgression , you who be spiritual should correct that one in a gentle spirit , look to yourself , so that you also may not be tempt .        Bear one another burden ,    and so you will fulfill the law of Christ .         for if anyone think he be something when he be nothing , he be delude himself .       each one must examine his own work , and then he will have reason to boast with regard to himself alone , and not with regard to someone else ;      for each will bear his own load .       one who be be instruct in the word should share all good thing with his instructor .        make no mistake : God be not mock , for a person will reap only what he sow ,      because the one who sow for his flesh will reap corruption from the flesh , but the one who sow for the spirit will reap eternal life from the spirit .        let we not grow tired of do good , for in due time we shall reap our harvest , if we do not give up .        so then , while we have the opportunity , let we do good to all ,    but especially to those who belong to the family of the faith .    Final Appeal .        see with what large letter    I be write to you in my own hand !         it be those who want to make a good appearance in the flesh who be try to compel you to have yourself circumcise , only that they may not be persecute for the cross of Christ .        not even those have themselves circumcise    observe the law themselves ; they only want you to be circumcise so that they may boast of your flesh .      but may I never boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ , through which    the world have be crucify to I , and I to the world .        for neither do circumcision mean anything , nor do uncircumcision ,    but only a new creation .        peace and mercy be to all who follow this rule    and to the Israel of God .      from now on , let no one make trouble for I ; for I bear the mark of Jesus    on my body .      the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit , brother . amen .
