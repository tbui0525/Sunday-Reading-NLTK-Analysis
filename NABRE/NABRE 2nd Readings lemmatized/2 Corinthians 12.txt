b '    I    must boast ; not that it be profitable , but I will go on to vision and revelation of the Lord .      I know someone in Christ who , fourteen year ago ( whether in the body or out of the body I do not know , God know ) , be catch up to the third heaven .      and I know that this person ( whether in the body or out of the body I do not know , God know )      be catch up into Paradise and hear ineffable thing , which no one may utter .        about this person    I will boast , but about myself I will not boast , except about my weakness .      although if I should wish to boast , I would not be foolish , for I would be tell the truth . but I refrain , so that no one may think more of I than what he see in I or hear from I      because of the abundance of the revelation . therefore , that I might not become too elated ,    a thorn in the flesh be give to I , an angel of Satan , to beat I , to keep I from be too elated .        three time    I beg the Lord about this , that it might leave I ,         but he say to I , my grace be sufficient for you , for power be make perfect in weakness . I will rather boast most gladly of my weakness ,    in order that the power of Christ may dwell with I .        therefore , I be content with weakness , insult , hardship , persecution , and constraint , for the sake of Christ ;    for when I be weak , then I be strong .   Selfless Concern for the Church .        I have be foolish . you compel I , for I ought to have be commend by you . for I be in no way inferior to these superapostle ,    even though I be nothing .       the sign of an apostle be perform among you with all endurance , sign and wonder , and mighty deed .         in what way be you less privileged than the rest of the church , except that on my part I do not burden you ? forgive I this wrong !      now I be ready to come to you this third time . and I will not be a burden , for I want not what be yours , but you . child ought not to save for their parent , but parent for their child .      I will most gladly spend and be utterly spend for your sake . if I love you more , be I to be love less ?      but grant that I myself do not burden you , yet I be crafty and get the well of you by deceit .        do I take advantage of you through any of those I send to you ?      I urge Titus to go and send the brother with he . do Titus take advantage of you ? do we not walk in the same spirit ? and in the same step ?   Final Warnings and Appeals .        have you be think all along that we be defend    ourselves before you ? in the sight of God we be speak in Christ , and all for build you up , belove .      for I fear that    when I come I may find you not such as I wish , and that you may find I not as you wish ; that there may be rivalry , jealousy , fury , selfishness , slander , gossip , conceit , and disorder .        I fear that when I come again    my God may humiliate I before you , and I may have to mourn over many of those who sin early and have not repent of the impurity , immorality , and licentiousness they practice .
