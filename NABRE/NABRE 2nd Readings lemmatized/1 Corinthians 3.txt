b '     brother , I could not talk to you as spiritual people , but as fleshly people ,    as infant in Christ .      I feed you milk , not solid food , because you be unable to take it . indeed , you be still not able , even now ,        for you be still of the flesh . while there be jealousy and rivalry among you ,    be you not of the flesh and behave in an ordinary human way ?        whenever someone say , I belong to Paul , and another , I belong to Apollos , be you not merely human ?   the role of Gods Ministers .        what be Apollos , after all , and what be Paul ? minister    through whom you become believer , just as the Lord assign each one .      I plant , Apollos water , but God cause the growth .        therefore , neither the one who plant nor the one who water be anything , but only God , who cause the growth .      the one who plant and the one who water be equal , and each will receive wage in proportion to his labor .      for we be Gods co - worker ; you be Gods field , Gods building .       accord to the grace of God give to I , like a wise master builder I lay a foundation , and another be build upon it . but each one must be careful how he build upon it ,      for no one can lay a foundation other than the one that be there , namely , Jesus Christ .      if anyone build on this foundation with gold , silver , precious stone , wood , hay , or straw ,      the work of each will come to light , for the day    will disclose it . it will be reveal with fire , and the fire [ itself ] will test the quality of each one work .        if the work stand that someone build upon the foundation , that person will receive a wage .      but if someone work be burn up , that one will suffer loss ; the person will be save ,    but only as through fire .      do you not know that you be the temple of God , and that the Spirit of God dwell in you ?        if anyone destroy Gods temple , God will destroy that person ; for the temple of God , which you be , be holy .      let no one deceive himself . if anyone among you consider himself wise in this age , let he become a fool so as to become wise .        for the wisdom of this world be foolishness in the eye of God , for it be write :   he catch the wise in their own ruse ,     and again : the Lord know the thought of the wise , that they be vain .       so let no one boast about human being , for everything belong to you ,        Paul or Apollos or Cephas , or the world or life or death , or the present or the future : all belong to you ,      and you to Christ , and Christ to God .
