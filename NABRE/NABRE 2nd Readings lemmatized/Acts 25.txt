b '   Appeal to Caesar .     three day after his arrival in the province , Festus go up from Caesarea to Jerusalem      where the chief priest and jewish leader present he their formal charge against Paul .    they ask he      as a favor to have he send to Jerusalem , for they be plot to kill he along the way .      Festus reply that Paul be be hold in custody in Caesarea and that he himself would be return there shortly .      he say , let your authority come down with I , and if this man have do something improper , let they accuse he .     after spend no more than eight or ten day with they , he go down to Caesarea , and on the following day take his seat on the tribunal and order that Paul be bring in .      when he appear , the Jews who have come down from Jerusalem surround he and bring many serious charge against he , which they be unable to prove .      in defend himself Paul say , I have commit no crime either against the jewish law or against the temple or against Caesar .       then Festus , wish to ingratiate himself with the Jews , say to Paul in reply , be you willing to go up to Jerusalem and there stand trial before I on these charge ?      Paul answer , I be stand before the tribunal of Caesar ; this be where I should be try . I have commit no crime against the Jews , as you very well know .      if I have commit a crime or do anything deserve death , I do not seek to escape the death penalty ; but if there be no substance to the charge they be bring against I , then no one have the right to hand I over to they . I appeal to Caesar .      then Festus , after confer with his council , reply , you have appeal to Caesar . to Caesar you will go .    Paul before King Agrippa .     when a few day have pass , King Agrippa and Bernice    arrive in Caesarea on a visit to Festus .      since they spend several day there , Festus refer Pauls case to the king , say , there be a man here leave in custody by Felix .        when I be in Jerusalem the chief priest and the elder of the Jews bring charge against he and demand his condemnation .      I answer they that it be not roman practice to hand over an accuse person before he have face his accuser and have the opportunity to defend himself against their charge .      so when [ they ] come together here , I make no delay ; the next day I take my seat on the tribunal and order the man to be bring in .       his accuser stand around he , but do not charge he with any of the crime I suspect .      instead they have some issue with he about their own religion and about a certain Jesus who have die but who Paul claim be alive .      since I be at a loss how to investigate this controversy , I ask if he be willing to go to Jerusalem and there stand trial on these charge .      and when Paul appeal that he be hold in custody for the Emperors decision , I order he hold until I could send he to Caesar .      Agrippa say to Festus , I too should like to hear this man . he reply , tomorrow you will hear he .     the next day Agrippa and Bernice come with great ceremony and enter the audience hall in the company of cohort commander and the prominent man of the city and , by command of Festus , Paul be bring in .      and Festus say , King Agrippa and all you here present with we , look at this man about whom the whole jewish populace petition I here and in Jerusalem , clamor that he should live no long .      I find , however , that he have do nothing deserve death , and so when he appeal to the Emperor , I decide to send he .      but I have nothing definite to write about he to our sovereign ; therefore I have bring he before all of you , and particularly before you , King Agrippa , so that I may have something to write as a result of this investigation .      for it seem senseless to I to send up a prisoner without indicate the charge against he .
