John , to the seven church in Asia :    grace to you and peace from he who be and who be and who be to come , and from the seven spirit before his throne ,        and from Jesus Christ , the faithful witness , the firstborn of the dead and ruler of the king of the earth . to he who love we and have free we    from our sin by his blood ,        who have make we into a kingdom , priest for his God and Father , to he be glory and power forever [ and ever ] . amen .      behold , he be come amid the cloud ,   and every eye will see he ,   even those who pierce he . all the people of the earth will lament he .   yes . amen .      I be the alpha and the omega ,    say the Lord God , the one who be and who be and who be to come , the almighty .   the First Vision .        I , John , your brother , who share with you the distress , the kingdom , and the endurance we have in Jesus , find myself on the island call Patmos    because I proclaim Gods word and give testimony to Jesus .      I be catch up in spirit on the Lords day    and hear behind I a voice as loud as a trumpet ,      which say , write on a scroll    what you see and send it to the seven church : to Ephesus , Smyrna , Pergamum , Thyatira , Sardis , Philadelphia , and Laodicea .       then I turn to see whose voice it be that speak to I , and when I turn , I see seven gold lampstand      and in the midst of the lampstand one like a son of man ,    wear an ankle - length robe , with a gold sash around his chest .        the hair of his head be as white as white wool or as snow ,    and his eye be like a fiery flame .      his foot be like polished brass refine in a furnace ,    and his voice be like the sound of rush water .      in his right hand he hold seven star .    a sharp two - edge sword come out of his mouth , and his face shine like the sun at its bright .      when I catch sight of he , I fall down at his foot as though dead .    he touch I with his right hand and say , do not be afraid . I be the first and the last ,        the one who live . once I be dead , but now I be alive forever and ever . I hold the key to death and the netherworld .        write down , therefore , what you have see , and what be happen , and what will happen afterwards .        this be the secret meaning    of the seven star you see in my right hand , and of the seven gold lampstand : the seven star be the angel of the seven church , and the seven lampstand be the seven church .
