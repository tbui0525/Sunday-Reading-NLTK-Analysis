b '   warn against Overconfidence .      I do not want you to be unaware , brother , that our ancestor be all under the cloud and all pass through the sea ,        and all of they be baptize into Moses in the cloud and in the sea .        all eat the same spiritual food ,      and all drink the same spiritual drink , for they drink from a spiritual rock that follow they ,    and the rock be the Christ .        yet God be not pleased with most of they , for they be strike down in the desert .       these thing happen as example for we , so that we might not desire evil thing , as they do .        and do not become idolater , as some of they do , as it be write , the people sit down to eat and drink , and rise up to revel .        let we not indulge in immorality as some of they do , and twenty - three thousand fall within a single day .        let we not test Christ    as some of they do , and suffer death by serpent .        do not grumble as some of they do , and suffer death by the destroyer .        these thing happen to they as an example , and they have be write down as a warning to we , upon whom the end of the age have come .        therefore , whoever think he be stand secure should take care not to fall .        no trial have come to you but what be human . God be faithful and will not let you be try beyond your strength ; but with the trial he will also provide a way out , so that you may be able to bear it .   warn against Idolatry .        therefore , my beloved , avoid idolatry .        I be speak as to sensible people ; judge for yourself what I be say .      the cup of blessing that we bless , be it not a participation in the blood of Christ ? the bread that we break , be it not a participation in the body of Christ ?        because the loaf of bread be one , we , though many , be one body , for we all partake of the one loaf .      look at Israel accord to the flesh ; be not those who eat the sacrifice participant in the altar ?        so what be I say ? that meat sacrifice to idol be anything ? or that an idol be anything ?      no , I mean that what they sacrifice , [ they sacrifice ] to demon ,    not to God , and I do not want you to become participant with demon .        you can not drink the cup of the Lord and also the cup of demon . you can not partake of the table of the Lord and of the table of demon .        or be we provoke the Lord to jealous anger ? be we strong than he ?   seek the good of other .        everything be lawful , but not everything be beneficial .    everything be lawful , but not everything build up .        no one should seek his own advantage , but that of his neighbor .         eat anything sell in the market , without raise question on ground of conscience ,      for the earth and its fullness be the Lords .        if an unbeliever invite you and you want to go , eat whatever be place before you , without raise question on ground of conscience .      but if someone say to you , this be offer in sacrifice , do not eat it on account of the one who call attention to it and on account of conscience ;      I mean not your own conscience , but the other . for why should my freedom be determine by someone else conscience ?      if I partake thankfully , why be I revile for that over which I give thank ?      so whether you eat or drink , or whatever you do , do everything for the glory of God .       avoid give offense , whether to Jews or Greeks or the church of God ,      just as I try to please everyone in every way , not seek my own benefit but that of the many , that they may be save .
