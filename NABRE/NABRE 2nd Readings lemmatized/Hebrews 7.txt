b '   Melchizedek , a type of Christ .      this Melchizedek , king of Salem and priest of God most High ,    meet Abraham as he return from his defeat of the king and bless he .         and Abraham apportion to he a tenth of everything . his name first mean righteous king , and he be also king of Salem , that is , king of peace .      without father , mother , or ancestry , without begin of day or end of life ,    thus make to resemble the Son of God , he remain a priest forever .       see how great he be to whom the patriarch Abraham [ indeed ] give a tenth of his spoil .        the descendant of Levi who receive the office of priesthood have a commandment accord to the law to exact tithe from the people , that is , from their brother , although they also have come from the loin of Abraham .        but he who be not of their ancestry receive tithe from Abraham and bless he who have receive the promise .      unquestionably , a less person be bless by a great .        in the one case , mortal man receive tithe ; in the other , a man of whom it be testify that he live on .      one might even say that Levi    himself , who receive tithe , be tithe through Abraham ,      for he be still in his father loin when Melchizedek meet he .      if , then , perfection come through the levitical priesthood , on the basis of which the people receive the law , what need would there still have be for another priest to arise accord to the order of Melchizedek , and not reckon accord to the order of Aaron ?        when there be a change of priesthood , there be necessarily a change of law as well .      now he of whom these thing be say    belong to a different tribe , of which no member ever officiate at the altar .      it be clear that our Lord arise from Judah ,    and in regard to that tribe Moses say nothing about priest .         it be even more obvious if another priest be raise up after the likeness of Melchizedek ,      who have become so , not by a law express in a commandment concern physical descent but by the power of a life that can not be destroy .        for it be testify : you be a priest forever   accord to the order of Melchizedek .      on the one hand , a former commandment be annul because of its weakness and uselessness ,        for the law bring nothing to perfection ; on the other hand , a well hope    be introduce , through which we draw near to God .       and to the degree that this happen not without the taking of an oath   \xe2\x80\x94for other become priest without an oath ,      but he with an oath , through the one who say to he : the Lord have swear , and he will not repent :    you be a priest forever\xe2\x80\x94      to that same degree have Jesus [ also ] become the guarantee of an [ even ] well covenant .        those priest be many because they be prevent by death from remain in office ,      but he , because he remain forever , have a priesthood that do not pass away .         therefore , he be always able to save those who approach God through he , since he live forever to make intercession for they .       it be fitting that we should have such a high priest :    holy , innocent , undefiled , separate from sinner , high than the heavens .        he have no need , as do the high priest , to offer sacrifice day after day ,     first for his own sin and then for those of the people ; he do that once for all when he offer himself .      for the law appoint man subject to weakness to be high priest , but the word of the oath , which be take after the law , appoint a son , who have be make perfect forever .
