b '   Christ and his commandment .     my child ,    I be write this to you so that you may not commit sin . but if anyone do sin , we have an Advocate with the Father , Jesus Christ the righteous one .        he be expiation for our sin , and not for our sin only but for those of the whole world .        the way we may be sure    that we know he be to keep his commandment .        whoever say , I know he , but do not keep his commandment be a liar , and the truth be not in he .        but whoever keep his word , the love of God be truly perfect in he . this be the way we may know that we be in union with he :        whoever claim to abide in he ought to live [ just ] as he live . the New Commandment .        beloved , I be write no new commandment to you but an old commandment that you have from the beginning . the old commandment be the word that you have hear .        and yet I do write a new commandment to you , which hold true in he and among you ,    for the darkness be pass away , and the true light be already shine .        whoever say he be in the light , yet hate his brother , be still in the darkness .        whoever love his brother remain in the light , and there be nothing in he to cause a fall .        whoever hate his brother be in darkness ; he walk in darkness and do not know where he be go because the darkness have blind his eye . member of the Community .        I be write to you , child , because your sin have be forgive    for his name sake .      I be write to you , father , because you know he who be from the beginning . I be write to you , young man , because you have conquer the evil one .      I write to you , child , because you know the Father . I write to you , father , because you know he who be from the beginning . I write to you , young man , because you be strong and the word of God remain in you , and you have conquer the evil one .     do not love the world or the thing of the world .    if anyone love the world , the love of the Father be not in he .        for all that be in the world , sensual lust ,    enticement for the eye , and a pretentious life , be not from the Father but be from the world .      yet the world and its enticement be pass away . but whoever do the will of God remain forever .     Antichrists .     child , it be the last hour ;    and just as you hear that the antichrist be come , so now many antichrist have appear . thus we know this be the last hour .        they go out from we , but they be not really of our number ;    if they have be , they would have remain with we . their desertion show that none of they be of our number .      but you have the anointing that come from the holy one ,    and you all have knowledge .

I write you these thing about those who would deceive you .      as for you , the anointing that you receive from he remain in you , so that you do not need anyone to teach you . but his anointing teach you about everything and be true and not false ; just as it teach you , remain in he .    child of God .      and now , child , remain in he , so that when he appear we may have confidence and not be put to shame by he at his coming .      if you consider that he be righteous , you also know that everyone who act in righteousness be beget by he .
