b '   the two witness .       then I be give a measure rod like a staff and I be tell , come and measure the temple of God and the altar , and count those who be worship in it .      but exclude the outer court    of the temple ; do not measure it , for it have be hand over to the Gentiles , who will trample the holy city for forty - two month .      I will commission my two witness    to prophesy for those twelve hundred and sixty day , wear sackcloth .       these be the two olive tree and the two lampstand    that stand before the Lord of the earth .       if anyone want to harm they , fire come out of their mouth and devour their enemy . in this way , anyone want to harm they be sure to be slay .      they have the power to close up the sky so that no rain can fall during the time of their prophesying . they also have power to turn water into blood and to afflict the earth with any plague as often as they wish .      when they have finish their testimony , the beast that come up from the abyss    will wage war against they and conquer they and kill they .        their corpse will lie in the main street of the great city ,    which have the symbolic name Sodom and Egypt , where indeed their Lord be crucify .       those from every people , tribe , tongue , and nation will gaze on their corpse for three and a half day , and they will not allow their corpse to be bury .      the inhabitant of the earth will gloat over they and be glad and exchange gift because these two prophet torment the inhabitant of the earth .      but after the three and a half day , a breath of life from God enter they . when they stand on their foot , great fear fall on those who see they .        then they hear a loud voice from heaven say to they , come up here . so they go up to heaven in a cloud as their enemy look on .        at that moment there be a great earthquake , and a tenth of the city fall in ruin . seven thousand people    be kill during the earthquake ; the rest be terrify and give glory to the God of heaven .     the second woe have pass , but the third be come soon . the Seventh Trumpet .        then the seventh angel blow his trumpet . there be loud voice in heaven , say , the kingdom of the world now belong to our Lord and to his Anointed , and he will reign forever and ever .      the twenty - four elder who sit on their throne before God prostrate themselves and worship God      and say : we give thank to you , Lord God almighty ,   who be and who be . for you have assume your great power   and have establish your reign .   the nation rage ,   but your wrath have come ,   and the time for the dead to be judge , and to recompense your servant , the prophet ,   and the holy one and those who fear your name ,   the small and the great alike , and to destroy those who destroy the earth .      then Gods temple in heaven be open , and the ark of his covenant could be see in the temple . there be flash of lightning , rumbling , and peal of thunder , an earthquake , and a violent hailstorm .
