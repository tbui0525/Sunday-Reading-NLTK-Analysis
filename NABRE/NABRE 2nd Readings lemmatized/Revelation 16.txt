b '   the Seven Bowls .      I hear a loud voice speak from the temple to the seven angel , go and pour out the seven bowl of Gods fury upon the earth .     the first angel go and pour out his bowl on the earth . fester and ugly sore break out on those who have the mark of the beast or worship its image .       the second angel pour out his bowl on the sea . the sea turn to blood like that from a corpse ; every creature live in the sea die .     the third angel pour out his bowl on the river and spring of water . these also turn to blood .        then I hear the angel in charge of the water say : you be just , o Holy One ,   who be and who be ,   in pass this sentence .    for they have shed the blood of the holy one and the prophet ,   and you [ have ] give they blood to drink ;   it be what they deserve .      then I hear the altar cry out , yes , Lord God almighty ,   your judgment be true and just .      the fourth angel pour out his bowl on the sun . it be give the power to burn people with fire .      People be burn by the scorch heat and blaspheme the name of God who have power over these plague , but they do not repent or give he glory .       the fifth angel pour out his bowl on the throne of the beast .    its kingdom be plunge into darkness , and people bite their tongue in pain      and blaspheme the God of heaven because of their pain and sore . but they do not repent of their work .      the sixth angel empty his bowl on the great river Euphrates . its water be dry up to prepare the way for the king of the East .        I see three unclean spirit like frog    come from the mouth of the dragon , from the mouth of the beast , and from the mouth of the false prophet .        these be demonic spirit who perform sign . they go out to the king of the whole world to assemble they for the battle on the great day of God the almighty .        ( behold , I be come like a thief .    bless be the one who watch and keep his clothe ready , so that he may not go naked and people see he expose . )        they then assemble the king in the place that be name Armageddon    in Hebrew .     the seventh angel pour out his bowl into the air . a loud voice come out of the temple from the throne , say , it be do .        then there be lightning flash , rumbling , and peal of thunder , and a great earthquake . it be such a violent earthquake that there have never be one like it since the human race begin on earth .        the great city    be split into three part , and the gentile city fall . but God remember great Babylon , give it the cup fill with the wine of his fury and wrath .       every island flee , and mountain disappear .      large hailstone like huge weight come down from the sky on people , and they blaspheme God for the plague of hail because this plague be so severe .
