b '   the Scroll and the Lamb .      I see a scroll    in the right hand of the one who sit on the throne . it have write on both side and be seal with seven seal .        then I see a mighty angel who proclaim in a loud voice , who be worthy to open the scroll and break its seal ?      but no one in heaven or on earth or under the earth be able to open the scroll or to examine it .      I shed many tear because no one be find worthy to open the scroll or to examine it .      one of the elder say to I , do not weep . the lion of the tribe of Judah , the root of David ,    have triumph , enable he to open the scroll with its seven seal .      then I see stand in the midst of the throne and the four live creature and the elder a Lamb    that seem to have be slay . he have seven horn and seven eye ; these be the [ seven ] spirit of God send out into the whole world .        he come and receive the scroll from the right hand of the one who sit on the throne .      when he take it , the four live creature and the twenty - four elder fall down before the Lamb . each of the elder hold a harp and gold bowl fill with incense , which be the prayer of the holy one .      they sing a new hymn : Worthy be you to receive the scroll   and to break open its seal ,   for you be slay and with your blood you purchase for God   those from every tribe and tongue , people and nation .   you make they a kingdom and priest for our God ,   and they will reign on earth .      I look again and hear the voice of many angel who surround the throne and the live creature and the elder . they be countless    in number ,        and they cry out in a loud voice : Worthy be the Lamb that be slay   to receive power and rich , wisdom and strength ,   honor and glory and blessing .     then I hear every creature in heaven and on earth and under the earth and in the sea , everything in the universe , cry out : to the one who sit on the throne and to the Lamb   be blessing and honor , glory and might ,   forever and ever .     the four live creature answer , amen , and the elder fall down and worship .
