b '   Faith be victory over the World .      everyone who believe that Jesus be the Christ be beget by God , and everyone who love the father love [ also ] the one beget by he .        in this way we know that we love the child of God when we love God and obey his commandment .      for the love of God be this , that we keep his commandment . and his commandment be not burdensome ,        for whoever be beget by God conquer the world . and the victory that conquer the world be our faith .        who [ indeed ] be the victor over the world but the one who believe that Jesus be the Son of God ?      this be the one who come through water and blood ,    Jesus Christ , not by water alone , but by water and blood . the Spirit be the one that testify , and the Spirit be truth .        so there be three that testify ,      the Spirit , the water , and the blood , and the three be of one accord .        if we accept human testimony , the testimony of God be surely great . now the testimony of God be this , that he have testify on behalf of his Son .        whoever believe in the Son of God have this testimony within himself . whoever do not believe God have make he a liar by not believe the testimony God have give about his Son .        and this be the testimony : God give we eternal life , and this life be in his Son .        whoever possess the Son have life ; whoever do not possess the Son of God do not have life .    prayer for sinner .     I write these thing to you so that you may know that you have eternal life , you who believe in the name of the Son of God .        and we have this confidence in he , that if we ask anything accord to his will , he hear we .        and if we know that he hear we in regard to whatever we ask , we know that what we have ask he for be ours .      if anyone see his brother sin , if the sin be not deadly , he should pray to God and he will give he life . this be only for those whose sin be not deadly . there be such a thing as deadly sin , about which I do not say that you should pray .        all wrongdoing be sin , but there be sin that be not deadly .     we know that no one beget by God sin ; but the one beget by God he protect , and the evil one can not touch he .      we know that we belong to God , and the whole world be under the power of the evil one .      we also know that the Son of God have come and have give we discernment to know the one who be true . and we be in the one who be true , in his Son Jesus Christ . he be the true God and eternal life .        child , be on your guard against idol .
