b '   preach without Charge .      if only you would put up with a little foolishness from I !    please put up with I .         for I be jealous of you with the jealousy of God , since I betroth you to one husband to present you as a chaste virgin to Christ .        but I be afraid that , as the serpent deceive Eve    by his cunning , your thought may be corrupt from a sincere [ and pure ] commitment to Christ .        for if someone come and preach another Jesus    than the one we preach ,    or if you receive a different spirit from the one you receive or a different gospel from the one you accept , you put up with it well enough .        for I think that I be not in any way inferior to these superapostle .      even if I be untrained in speak , I be not so in knowledge ;    in every way we have make this plain to you in all thing .       do I make a mistake when I humble myself so that you might be exalt , because I preach the gospel of God to you without charge ?        I plunder other church by accept from they in order to minister to you .      and when I be with you and in need , I do not burden anyone , for the brother who come from Macedonia supply my need . so I refrain and will refrain from burden you in any way .        by the truth of Christ in I , this boast of mine shall not be silence in the region of Achaia .         and why ? because I do not love you ? God know I do !      and what I do I will continue to do , in order to end this pretext of those who seek a pretext for be regard as we be in the mission of which they boast .       for such people be false apostle , deceitful worker , who masquerade as apostle of Christ .      and no wonder , for even Satan masquerade as an angel of light .      so it be not strange that his minister also masquerade as minister of righteousness . their end will correspond to their deed .    Pauls Boast : his Labors .      I repeat , no one should consider I foolish ;    but if you do , accept I as a fool , so that I too may boast a little .        what I be say I be not say accord to the Lord but as in foolishness , in this boastful state .      since many boast accord to the flesh , I too will boast .      for you gladly put up with fool , since you be wise yourself .       for you put up with it if someone enslave you , or devour you , or get the well of you , or put on air , or slap you in the face .      to my shame I say that we be too weak !   but what anyone dare to boast of ( I be speak in foolishness ) I also dare .       be they Hebrews ? so be i. be they Israelites ? so be i. be they descendant of Abraham ? so be i.         be they minister of Christ ? ( I be talk like an insane person . )    I be still more ,    with far great labor , far more imprisonment , far bad beating , and numerous brush with death .      five time at the hand of the Jews I receive forty lash minus one .        three time I be beat with rod , once I be stone , three time I be shipwreck , I pass a night and a day on the deep ;        on frequent journey , in danger from river , danger from robber , danger from my own race , danger from Gentiles , danger in the city , danger in the wilderness , danger at sea , danger among false brother ;      in toil and hardship , through many sleepless night , through hunger and thirst , through frequent fasting , through cold and exposure .        and apart from these thing , there be the daily pressure upon I of my anxiety for all the church .      who be weak , and I be not weak ? who be lead to sin , and I be not indignant ?   Pauls Boast : his weakness .        if I must boast , I will boast of the thing that show my weakness .       the God and Father of the Lord Jesus know , he who be bless forever , that I do not lie .      at Damascus , the governor under King Aretas guard the city of Damascus , in order to seize I ,      but I be lower in a basket through a window in the wall and escape his hand .
