b '     Brothers , my heart desire and prayer to God on their behalf be for salvation .        I testify with regard to they that they have zeal for God , but it be not discerning .        for , in their unawareness of the righteousness that come from God and their attempt to establish their own [ righteousness ] , they do not submit to the righteousness of God .        for Christ be the end    of the law for the justification of everyone who have faith .       Moses write about the righteousness that come from [ the ] law , the one who do these thing will live by they .        but the righteousness that come from faith say ,    do not say in your heart , who will go up into heaven ? ( that is , to bring Christ down )       or who will go down into the abyss ? ( that is , to bring Christ up from the dead ) .        but what do it say ? the word be near you ,   in your mouth and in your heart   ( that is , the word of faith that we preach ) ,      for , if you confess    with your mouth that Jesus be Lord and believe in your heart that God raise he from the dead , you will be save .        for one believe with the heart and so be justify , and one confess with the mouth and so be save .      for the scripture say , no one who believe in he will be put to shame .        for there be no distinction between Jew and Greek ; the same Lord be Lord of all , enrich all who call upon he .        for everyone who call on the name of the Lord will be save .       but how can they call on he in whom they have not believe ? and how can they believe in he of whom they have not hear ? and how can they hear without someone to preach ?        and how can people preach unless they be send ? as it be write ,    how beautiful be the foot of those who bring [ the ] good news !        but not everyone have heed the good news ; for Isaiah say , Lord , who have believe what be hear from we ?        thus faith come from what be hear , and what be hear come through the word of Christ .        but I ask , do they not hear ? certainly they do ; for their voice have go forth to all the earth ,   and their word to the end of the world .      but I ask , do not Israel understand ?    First Moses say : I will make you jealous of those who be not a nation ;   with a senseless nation I will make you angry .      then Isaiah speak boldly and say : I be find [ by ] those who be not seek I ;   I reveal myself to those who be not ask for I .     but regard Israel he say , all day long I stretch out my hand to a disobedient and contentious people .
