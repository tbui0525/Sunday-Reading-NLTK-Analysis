b '    the Presbyter to the beloved Gaius whom I love in truth .      beloved , I hope you be prosper in every respect and be in good health , just as your soul be prosper .      I rejoice greatly when some of the brother    come and testify to how truly you walk in the truth .        nothing give I great joy than to hear that my child be walk in the truth .      beloved , you be faithful in all you do    for the brother , especially for stranger ;        they have testify to your love before the church .    please help they in a way worthy of God to continue their journey .        for they have set out for the sake of the Name    and be accept nothing from the pagan .      therefore , we ought to support such person , so that we may be co - worker in the truth .     I write to the church , but Diotrephes , who love to dominate ,    do not acknowledge we .      therefore , if I come ,    I will draw attention to what he be do , spread evil nonsense about we . and not content with that , he will not receive the brother , hinder those who wish to do so and expel they from the church .     Beloved , do not imitate evil    but imitate good . whoever do what be good be of God ; whoever do what be evil have never see God .        Demetrius    receive a good report from all , even from the truth itself . we give our testimonial as well , and you know our testimony be true .      I have much to write to you , but I do not wish to write with pen and ink .        instead , I hope to see you soon , when we can talk face to face .      peace be with you . the friend greet you ; greet the friend    there each by name .
