b '   the fall of Babylon .      after this I see another angel come down from heaven , have great authority , and the earth become illumined by his splendor .         he cry out in a mighty voice : Fallen , fall be Babylon the great .    she have become a haunt for demon . she be a cage for every unclean spirit ,   a cage for every unclean bird ,   [ a cage for every unclean ] and disgusting [ beast ] .   for all the nation have drink    the wine of her licentious passion . the king of the earth have intercourse with she ,   and the merchant of the earth grow rich from her drive for luxury .      then I hear another voice from heaven say : Depart from she ,    my people ,   so as not to take part in her sin   and receive a share in her plague ,    for her sin be pile up to the sky ,   and God remember her crime .    pay she back as she have pay other .   pay she back double for her deed .   into her cup pour double what she pour .    to the measure of her boasting and wantonness   repay she in torment and grief ; for she say to herself ,   I sit enthrone as queen ;   I be no widow ,   and I will never know grief .    therefore , her plague will come in one day ,   pestilence , grief , and famine ;   she will be consume by fire . for mighty be the Lord God who judge she .     the king of the earth who have intercourse with she in their wantonness will weep and mourn over she when they see the smoke of her pyre .      they will keep their distance for fear of the torment inflict on she , and they will say : alas , alas , great city ,   Babylon , mighty city .   in one hour your judgment have come .     the merchant of the earth will weep and mourn for she , because there will be no more market    for their cargo :      their cargo of gold , silver , precious stone , and pearl ; fine linen , purple silk , and scarlet cloth ; fragrant wood of every kind , all article of ivory and all article of the most expensive wood , bronze , iron , and marble ;      cinnamon , spice ,    incense , myrrh , and frankincense ; wine , olive oil , fine flour , and wheat ; cattle and sheep , horse and chariot , and slave , that is , human being .     the fruit you crave   have leave you . all your luxury and splendor be go ,   never again will one find they .      the merchant who deal in these good , who grow rich from she , will keep their distance for fear of the torment inflict on she . weeping and mourning ,      they cry out : alas , alas , great city ,   wear fine linen , purple and scarlet ,   adorn [ in ] gold , precious stone , and pearl .    in one hour this great wealth have be ruin . every captain of a ship , every traveler at sea , sailor , and seafare merchant stand at a distance      and cry out when they see the smoke of her pyre , what city could compare with the great city ?       they throw dust on their head and cry out , weeping and mourning : alas , alas , great city ,   in which all who have ship at sea   grow rich from her wealth . in one hour she have be ruin .   rejoice over she , heaven ,   you holy one , apostle , and prophet . for God have judge your case against she .      a mighty angel pick up a stone like a huge millstone and throw it into the sea and say : with such force will Babylon the great city be throw down ,   and will never be find again .    no melody of harpist and musician ,   flutist and trumpeter ,   will ever be hear in you again . no craftsman in any trade   will ever be find in you again . no sound of the millstone   will ever be hear in you again .    no light from a lamp   will ever be see in you again . no voice of bride and groom   will ever be hear in you again . because your merchant be the great one of the world ,   all nation be lead astray by your magic potion .    in she be find the blood of prophet and holy one   and all who have be slay on the earth .
