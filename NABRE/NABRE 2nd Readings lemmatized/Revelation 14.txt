b '   the Lambs Companions .      then I look and there be the Lamb stand on Mount Zion ,    and with he a hundred and forty - four thousand who have his name and his father name write on their forehead .        I hear a sound from heaven like the sound of rush water or a loud peal of thunder . the sound I hear be like that of harpist play their harp .      they be singe [ what seem to be ] a new hymn before the throne , before the four live creature and the elder . no one could learn this hymn except the hundred and forty - four thousand who have be ransom from the earth .        these be they who be not defile with woman ; they be virgin    and these be the one who follow the Lamb wherever he go . they have be ransom as the firstfruit of the human race for God and the Lamb .        on their lip no deceit    have be find ; they be unblemished .   the Three Angels .        then I see another angel fly high overhead , with everlaste good news    to announce to those who dwell on earth , to every nation , tribe , tongue , and people .      he say in a loud voice , fear God and give he glory , for his time have come to sit in judgment . worship he who make heaven and earth and sea and spring of water .      a second angel follow , say : Fallen , fall be Babylon the great ,    that make all the nation drink   the wine of her licentious passion .      a third angel follow they and say in a loud voice , anyone who worship the beast or its image , or accept its mark on forehead or hand ,      will also drink the wine of Gods fury ,    pour full strength into the cup of his wrath , and will be torment in burn sulfur before the holy angel and before the Lamb .      the smoke of the fire that torment they will rise forever and ever , and there will be no relief day or night for those who worship the beast or its image or accept the mark of its name .        here be what sustain the holy one who keep Gods commandment    and their faith in Jesus .       I hear a voice from heaven say , write this : bless be the dead who die in the Lord from now on . yes , say the Spirit , let they find rest from their labor , for their work accompany they .   the Harvest of the Earth .        then I look and there be a white cloud , and sit on the cloud one who look like a son of man , with a gold crown on his head and a sharp sickle in his hand .        another angel come out of the temple , cry out in a loud voice to the one sit on the cloud , use your sickle and reap the harvest , for the time to reap have come , because the earth harvest be fully ripe .        so the one who be sit on the cloud swing his sickle over the earth , and the earth be harvest .     then another angel come out of the temple in heaven who also have a sharp sickle .      then another angel [ come ] from the altar ,    [ who ] be in charge of the fire , and cry out in a loud voice to the one who have the sharp sickle , use your sharp sickle and cut the cluster from the earth vine , for its grape be ripe .      so the angel swing his sickle over the earth and cut the earth vintage . he throw it into the great wine press of Gods fury .        the wine press be trodden outside the city and blood pour out of the wine press to the height of a horse bridle for two hundred mile .
