b '    Greeting .       Paul , an apostle    not from human being nor through a human being but through Jesus Christ and God the Father who raise he from the dead ,         and all the brother who be with I , to the church of Galatia :      grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ ,       who give himself for our sin that he might rescue we from the present evil age in accord with the will of our God and Father ,        to whom be glory forever and ever . amen .     II . loyalty to the Gospel     I be amazed that you be so quickly forsake the one who call you    by [ the ] grace [ of Christ ] for a different gospel      ( not that there be another ) . but there be some who be disturb you and wish to pervert the gospel of Christ .       but even if we or an angel from heaven should preach [ to you ] a gospel other than the one that we preach to you , let that one be accurse !        as we have say before , and now I say again , if anyone preach to you a gospel other than the one that you receive , let that one be accurse !      be I now curry favor with human being or God ? or be I seek to please people ? if I be still try to please people , I would not be a slave of Christ .     III . Pauls Defense of his gospel and his Authority   his call by Christ .      now I want you to know , brother , that the gospel preach by I be not of human origin .      for I do not receive it from a human being , nor be I teach it , but it come through a revelation of Jesus Christ .       for you hear of my former way of life in Judaism , how I persecute the church of God beyond measure and try to destroy it ,        and progress in Judaism beyond many of my contemporary among my race , since I be even more a zealot for my ancestral tradition .        but when [ God ] , who from my mother womb have set I apart and call I through his grace , be pleased        to reveal his Son to I ,    so that I might proclaim he to the Gentiles , I do not immediately consult flesh and blood ,        nor do I go up to Jerusalem to those who be apostle before I ; rather , I go into Arabia    and then return to Damascus .      then after three year    I go up to Jerusalem to confer with Cephas and remain with he for fifteen day .        but I do not see any other of the apostle ,    only James the brother of the Lord .        ( as to what I be write to you , behold , before God , I be not lie . )        then I go into the region of Syria and Cilicia .        and I be unknown personally to the church of Judea that be in Christ ;      they only keep hear that the one who once be persecute we be now preach the faith he once try to destroy .        so they glorify God because of I .
