b '    Greeting .      Paul , an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God , and Timothy our brother , to the church of God that be in Corinth , with all the holy one throughout Achaia :        grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .    Thanksgiving .      bless be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , the Father of compassion and God of all encouragement ,        who encourage we in our every affliction , so that we may be able to encourage those who be in any affliction with the encouragement with which we ourselves be encourage by God .        for as Christs suffering overflow to we , so through Christ    do our encouragement also overflow .      if we be afflict , it be for your encouragement and salvation ; if we be encourage , it be for your encouragement , which enable you to endure the same suffering that we suffer .      our hope for you be firm , for we know that as you share in the suffering , you also share in the encouragement .      we do not want you to be unaware , brother , of the affliction that come to we in the province of Asia ;    we be utterly weigh down beyond our strength , so that we despair even of life .        indeed , we have accept within ourselves the sentence of death ,    that we might trust not in ourselves but in God who raise the dead .        he rescue we from such great danger of death , and he will continue to rescue we ; in he we have put our hope [ that ] he will also rescue we again ,        as you help we with prayer , so that thank may be give by many on our behalf for the gift grant we through the prayer of many .     II . the Crisis between Paul and the Corinthians a. Past relationship   Pauls Sincerity and Constancy .      for our boast be this , the testimony of our conscience that we have conduct ourselves in the world , and especially toward you , with the simplicity and sincerity of God , [ and ] not by human wisdom but by the grace of God .      for we write you nothing but what you can read and understand , and I hope that you will understand completely ,      as you have come to understand we partially , that we be your boast as you also be ours , on the day of [ our ] Lord Jesus .      with this confidence I formerly intend to come    to you so that you might receive a double favor ,      namely , to go by way of you to Macedonia , and then to come to you again on my return from Macedonia , and have you send I on my way to Judea .        so when I intend this , do I act lightly ?    or do I make my plan accord to human consideration , so that with I it be yes , yes and no , no ?        as God be faithful ,    our word to you be not yes and no .      for the Son of God , Jesus Christ , who be proclaim to you by we , Silvanus and Timothy and I , be not yes and no , but yes have be in he .        for however many be the promise of God , their yes be in he ; therefore , the amen from we also go through he to God for glory .         but the one who give we security with you in Christ and who anoint we be God ;        he have also put his seal upon we and give the Spirit in our heart as a first installment .     Pauls Change of Plan .      but I call upon God as witness , on my life , that it be to spare you that I have not yet go to Corinth .        not that we lord it over your faith ; rather , we work together for your joy , for you stand firm in the faith .
