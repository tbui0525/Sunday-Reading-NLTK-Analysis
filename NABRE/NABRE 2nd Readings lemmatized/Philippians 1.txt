b '    Greeting .      Paul and Timothy , slave    of Christ Jesus , to all the holy one in Christ Jesus who be in Philippi , with the overseer and minister :         grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .   Thanksgiving .        I give thank to my God at every remembrance of you ,        pray always with joy in my every prayer for all of you ,      because of your partnership for the gospel from the first day until now .       I be confident of this , that the one who begin a good work in you will continue to complete it until the day of Christ Jesus .        it be right that I should think this way about all of you , because I hold you in my heart , you who be all partner with I in grace , both in my imprisonment and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel .      for God be my witness , how I long for all of you with the affection of Christ Jesus .        and this be my prayer : that your love may increase ever more and more in knowledge and every kind of perception ,        to discern what be of value , so that you may be pure and blameless for the day of Christ ,        fill with the fruit of righteousness that come through Jesus Christ for the glory and praise of God .     II . progress of the Gospel     I want you to know , brother , that my situation have turn out rather to advance the gospel ,      so that my imprisonment have become well know in Christ throughout the whole praetorium    and to all the rest ,         and so that the majority of the brother , having take encouragement in the Lord from my imprisonment , dare more than ever to proclaim the word fearlessly .     of course , some preach Christ from envy and rivalry , other from good will .      the latter act out of love , aware that I be here for the defense of the gospel ;      the former proclaim Christ out of selfish ambition , not from pure motive , think that they will cause I trouble in my imprisonment .      what difference do it make , as long as in every way , whether in pretense or in truth , Christ be be proclaim ?    and in that I rejoice .   indeed I shall continue to rejoice ,       for I know that this will result in deliverance for I    through your prayer and support from the Spirit of Jesus Christ .        my eager expectation and hope be that I shall not be put to shame in any way , but that with all boldness , now as always , Christ will be magnify in my body , whether by life or by death .        for to I life be Christ , and death be gain .        if I go on live in the flesh , that mean fruitful labor for I . and I do not know which I shall choose .        I be catch between the two . I long to depart this life and be with Christ , [ for ] that be far well .        yet that I remain [ in ] the flesh be more necessary for your benefit .      and this I know with confidence , that I shall remain and continue in the service of all of you for your progress and joy in the faith ,      so that your boasting in Christ Jesus may abound on account of I when I come to you again . iii . instruction for the Community Steadfastness in Faith .        only , conduct yourself in a way worthy of the gospel of Christ , so that , whether I come and see you or be absent , I may hear news of you , that you be stand firm in one spirit , with one mind struggle together for the faith of the gospel ,        not intimidate in any way by your opponent . this be proof to they of destruction , but of your salvation . and this be god do .      for to you have be grant , for the sake of Christ , not only to believe in he but also to suffer for he .        yours be the same struggle    as you see in I and now hear about I .
