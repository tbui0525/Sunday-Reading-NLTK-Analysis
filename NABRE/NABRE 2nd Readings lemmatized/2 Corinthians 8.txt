b '   generosity in Giving .      we want you to know , brother ,    of the grace of God    that have be give to the church of Macedonia ,         for in a severe test of affliction , the abundance of their joy and their profound poverty overflow in a wealth of generosity on their part .       for accord to their mean , I can testify , and beyond their mean , spontaneously ,      they beg we insistently for the favor of take part in the service to the holy one ,        and this , not as we expect , but they give themselves first to the Lord and to we    through the will of God ,      so that we urge Titus    that , as he have already begin , he should also complete for you this gracious act also .         now as you excel in every respect , in faith , discourse , knowledge , all earnestness , and in the love we have for you ,    may you excel in this gracious act also .     I say this not by way of command , but to test the genuineness of your love by your concern for other .        for you know the gracious act of our Lord Jesus Christ , that for your sake he become poor although he be rich , so that by his poverty you might become rich .      and I be give counsel in this matter , for it be appropriate for you who begin not only to act but to act willingly last year :        complete it now , so that your eager    willingness may be match by your completion of it out of what you have .       for if the eagerness be there , it be acceptable accord to what one have , not accord to what one do not have ;      not that other should have relief while you be burden , but that as a matter of equality      your surplus at the present time should supply their need , so that their surplus may also supply your need , that there may be equality .      as it be write : whoever have much do not have more ,   and whoever have little do not have less .   Titus and his collaborator .        but thank be to God who put the same concern for you into the heart of Titus ,      for he not only welcome our appeal but , since he be very concerned , he have go to you of his own accord .      with he we have send the brother    who be praise in all the church for his preaching of the gospel .        and not only that , but he have also be appoint our travel companion by the church in this gracious work administer by we for the glory of the Lord [ himself ] and for the expression of our eagerness .        this we desire to avoid , that anyone blame we    about this lavish gift administer by we ,      for we be concerned for what be honorable not only in the sight of the Lord but also in the sight of other .        and with they we have send our brother whom we often test in many way and find earnest , but who be now much more earnest because of his great confidence in you .      as for Titus , he be my partner and co - worker for you ; as for our brother , they be apostle of the church , the glory of Christ .      so give proof before the church of your love and of our boasting about you to they .
