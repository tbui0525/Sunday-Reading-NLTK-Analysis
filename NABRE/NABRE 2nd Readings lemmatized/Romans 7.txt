b '   Freedom from the Law .      be you unaware , brother ( for I be speak to people who know the law ) , that the law have jurisdiction over one as long as one life ?      thus a married woman be bind by law to her live husband ; but if her husband die , she be release from the law in respect to her husband .        consequently , while her husband be alive she will be call an adulteress if she consort with another man . but if her husband die she be free from that law , and she be not an adulteress if she consort with another man .     in the same way , my brother , you also be put to death to the law through the body of Christ , so that you might belong to another , to the one who be raise from the dead in order that we might bear fruit for God .      for when we be in the flesh , our sinful passion , awaken by the law , work in our member to bear fruit for death .        but now we be release from the law , dead to what hold we captive , so that we may serve in the newness of the spirit and not under the obsolete letter .     Acquaintance with sin through the Law .      what then can we say ? that the law be sin ? of course not !    yet I do not know sin except through the law , and I do not know what it be to covet except that the law say , you shall not covet .        but sin , find an opportunity in the commandment , produce in I every kind of covetousness . apart from the law sin be dead .        I once live outside the law , but when the commandment come , sin become alive ;      then I die , and the commandment that be for life turn out to be death for I .        for sin , seize an opportunity in the commandment , deceive I and through it put I to death .        so then the law be holy , and the commandment be holy and righteous and good .   Sin and Death .        do the good , then , become death for I ? of course not ! sin , in order that it might be show to be sin , work death in I through the good , so that sin might become sinful beyond measure through the commandment .        we know that the law be spiritual ; but I be carnal , sell into slavery to sin .        what I do , I do not understand . for I do not do what I want , but I do what I hate .      now if I do what I do not want , I concur that the law be good .      so now it be no long I who do it , but sin that dwell in I .      for I know that good do not dwell in I , that is , in my flesh . the willing be ready at hand , but do the good be not .        for I do not do the good I want , but I do the evil I do not want .      now if [ i ] do what I do not want , it be no long I who do it , but sin that dwell in I .      so , then , I discover the principle that when I want to do right , evil be at hand .      for I take delight in the law of God , in my inner self ,       but I see in my member another principle at war with the law of my mind , take I captive to the law of sin that dwell in my member .        miserable one that I be ! who will deliver I from this mortal body ?      thank be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord . therefore , I myself , with my mind , serve the law of God but , with my flesh , the law of sin .
