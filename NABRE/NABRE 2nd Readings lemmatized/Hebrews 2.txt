b '   Exhortation to Faithfulness .      therefore , we must attend all the more to what we have hear , so that we may not be carry away .      for if the word announce through angel prove firm , and every transgression and disobedience receive its just recompense ,        how shall we escape if we ignore so great a salvation ? announce originally through the Lord , it be confirm for we by those who have hear .        God add his testimony by sign , wonder , various act of power , and distribution of the gift of the holy Spirit accord to his will .   Exaltation through Abasement .        for it be not to angel that he subject the world to come , of which we be speak .      instead , someone have testify somewhere : what be man that you be mindful of he ,   or the son of man that you care for he ?    you make he for a little while low than the angel ;   you crown he with glory and honor ,    subject all thing under his foot . in subject all thing [ to he ] , he leave nothing not subject to he . yet at present we do not see all thing subject to he ,        but we do see Jesus crown with glory and honor because he suffer death , he who for a little while be make low than the angel , that by the grace of God he might taste death for everyone .      for it be fitting that he , for whom and through whom all thing exist , in bring many child to glory , should make the leader to their salvation perfect through suffering .        he who consecrate and those who be be consecrate all have one origin . therefore , he be not ashamed to call they brother ,      say : I will proclaim your name to my brother ,   in the midst of the assembly I will praise you ;      and again : I will put my trust in he ; and again : behold , I and the child God have give I .      now since the child share in blood and flesh , he likewise share in they , that through death he might destroy the one who have the power of death , that is , the devil ,        and free those who through fear of death have be subject to slavery all their life .      surely he do not help angel but rather the descendant of Abraham ;      therefore , he have to become like his brother in every way , that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest before God to expiate the sin of the people .        because he himself be test through what he suffer , he be able to help those who be be test .
