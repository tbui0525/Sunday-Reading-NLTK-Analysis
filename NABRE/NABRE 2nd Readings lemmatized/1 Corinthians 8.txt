b ' chapter 8 Knowledge Insufficient .     now in regard to meat sacrifice to idol :    we realize that all of we have knowledge ; knowledge inflate with pride , but love build up .        if anyone suppose he know something , he do not yet know as he ought to know .      but if one love God , one be know by he .      so about the eating of meat sacrifice to idol : we know that there be no idol in the world , and that there be no God but one .        indeed , even though there be so - call god in heaven and on earth ( there be , to be sure , many god and many lord ) ,       yet for we there be one God , the Father ,   from whom all thing be and for whom we exist , and one Lord , Jesus Christ ,   through whom all thing be and through whom we exist .     Practical Rules .     but not all have this knowledge . there be some who have be so used to idolatry up until now that , when they eat meat sacrifice to idol , their conscience , which be weak , be defile .       now food will not bring we close to God . we be no bad off if we do not eat , nor be we well off if we do .        but make sure that this liberty of your in no way become a stumble block to the weak .        if someone see you , with your knowledge , recline at table in the temple of an idol , may not his conscience too , weak as it be , be build up to eat the meat sacrifice to idol ?      thus through your knowledge , the weak person be bring to destruction , the brother for whom Christ die .        when you sin in this way against your brother and wound their conscience , weak as they be , you be sin against Christ .        therefore , if food cause my brother to sin , I will never eat meat again , so that I may not cause my brother to sin .
