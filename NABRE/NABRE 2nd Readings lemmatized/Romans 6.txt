b '    Freedom from Sin ; life in God .      what then shall we say ? shall we persist in sin that grace may abound ? of course not !        how can we who die to sin yet live in it ?        or be you unaware that we who be baptize into Christ Jesus be baptize into his death ?        we be indeed bury with he through baptism into death , so that , just as Christ be raise from the dead by the glory of the Father , we too might live in newness of life .      for if we have grow into union with he through a death like his , we shall also be unite with he in the resurrection .        we know that our old self be crucify with he , so that our sinful body might be do away with , that we might no long be in slavery to sin .        for a dead person have be absolve from sin .      if , then , we have die with Christ , we believe that we shall also live with he .        we know that Christ , raise from the dead , die no more ; death no long have power over he .        as to his death , he die to sin once and for all ; as to his life , he live for God .        consequently , you too must think of yourself as [ be ] dead to sin and live for God in Christ Jesus .       therefore , sin must not reign over your mortal body so that you obey their desire .        and do not present the part of your body to sin as weapon for wickedness , but present yourself to God as raise from the dead to life and the part of your body to God as weapon for righteousness .        for sin be not to have any power over you , since you be not under the law but under grace .      what then ? shall we sin because we be not under the law but under grace ? of course not !        do you not know that if you present yourself to someone as obedient slave ,    you be slave of the one you obey , either of sin , which lead to death , or of obedience , which lead to righteousness ?        but thank be to God that , although you be once slave of sin , you have become obedient from the heart to the pattern of teaching to which you be entrust .        Freed from sin , you have become slave of righteousness .      I be speak in human term because of the weakness of your nature . for just as you present the part of your body as slave to impurity and to lawlessness for lawlessness , so now present they as slave to righteousness for sanctification .       for when you be slave of sin , you be free from righteousness .        but what profit do you get then from the thing of which you be now ashamed ? for the end of those thing be death .        but now that you have be free from sin and have become slave of God , the benefit that you have lead to sanctification ,    and its end be eternal life .        for the wage of sin be death , but the gift of God be eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord .
