b '   lawsuit before Unbelievers .      how can any one of you with a case against another dare to bring it to the unjust for judgment instead of to the holy one ?       do you not know that the holy one will judge the world ? if the world be to be judge by you , be you unqualified for the low law court ?        do you not know that we will judge angel ? then why not everyday matter ?      if , therefore , you have court for everyday matter , do you seat as judge people of no standing in the church ?      I say this to shame you . can it be that there be not one among you wise enough to be able to settle a case between brother ?      but rather brother go to court against brother , and that before unbeliever ?     now indeed [ then ] it be , in any case , a failure on your part that you have lawsuit against one another . why not rather put up with injustice ? why not rather let yourself be cheat ?        instead , you inflict injustice and cheat , and this to brother .       do you not know that the unjust will not inherit the kingdom of God ? do not be deceive ; neither fornicator nor idolater nor adulterer nor boy prostitute    nor sodomite        nor thief nor the greedy nor drunkard nor slanderer nor robber will inherit the kingdom of God .      that be what some of you use to be ; but now you have have yourself wash , you be sanctify , you be justify in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God .   Sexual Immorality .        everything be lawful for I ,    but not everything be beneficial . everything be lawful for I , but I will not let myself be dominate by anything .        Food for the stomach and the stomach for food , but God will do away with both the one and the other . the body , however , be not for immorality , but for the Lord , and the Lord be for the body ;      God raise the Lord and will also raise we by his power .      do you not know that your body be member of Christ ? shall I then take Christs member and make they the member of a prostitute ?    of course not !        [ or ] do you not know that anyone who join himself to a prostitute become one body with she ? for the two , it say , will become one flesh .        but whoever be join to the Lord become one spirit with he .        avoid immorality . every other sin a person commit be outside the body , but the immoral person sin against his own body .        do you not know that your body be a temple    of the holy Spirit within you , whom you have from God , and that you be not your own ?        for you have be purchase at a price . therefore glorify God in your body .
