b '    False Teachers .      there be also false prophet among the people , just as there will be false teacher among you , who will introduce destructive heresy and even deny the Master who ransom they , bring swift destruction on themselves .        many will follow their licentious way , and because of they the way of truth will be revile .        in their greed they will exploit you with fabrication , but from of old their condemnation have not be idle and their destruction do not sleep .     lesson from the past .      for if God do not spare the angel when they sin , but condemn they to the chain of Tartarus    and hand they over to be keep for judgment ;         and if he do not spare the ancient world , even though he preserve Noah , a herald of righteousness , together with seven other , when he bring a flood upon the godless world ;        and if he condemn the city of Sodom and Gomorrah [ to destruction ] , reduce they to ashe , make they an example for the godless [ people ] of what be come ;        and if he rescue Lot , a righteous man oppress by the licentious conduct of unprincipled people      ( for day after day that righteous man live among they be torment in his righteous soul at the lawless deed that he see and hear ) ,      then the Lord know how to rescue the devout from trial and to keep the unrighteous under punishment for the day of judgment ,        and especially those who follow the flesh with its depraved desire and show contempt for lordship .   false Teachers denounce .    bold and arrogant , they be not afraid to revile glorious being ,         whereas angel ,    despite their superior strength and power , do not bring a revile judgment against they from the Lord .      but these people , like irrational animal bear by nature for capture and destruction , revile thing that they do not understand , and in their destruction they will also be destroy ,        suffer wrong    as payment for wrongdoing . think daytime revelry a delight , they be stain and defilement as they revel in their deceit while carouse with you .        their eye be full of adultery and insatiable for sin . they seduce unstable people , and their heart be train in greed . accursed child !      abandon the straight road , they have go astray , follow the road of Balaam , the son of Bosor ,    who love payment for wrongdoing ,        but he receive a rebuke for his own crime : a mute beast speak with a human voice and restrain the prophet madness .      these people be waterless spring and mist drive by a gale ; for they the gloom of darkness have be reserve .        for , talk empty bombast , they seduce with licentious desire of the flesh those who have barely escape    from people who live in error .        they promise they freedom , though they themselves be slave of corruption , for a person be a slave of whatever overcome he .        for if they , having escape the defilement of the world through the knowledge of [ our ] Lord and savior Jesus Christ , again become entangled and overcome by they , their last condition be bad than their first .        for it would have be well for they not to have know the way of righteousness than after know it to turn back from the holy commandment hand down    to they .         what be express in the true proverb have happen to they ,    the dog return to its own vomit , and a bathe sow return to wallow in the mire .
