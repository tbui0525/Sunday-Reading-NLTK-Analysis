b '    this third time I be come    to you . on the testimony of two or three witness a fact shall be establish .        I warn those who sin early    and all the other , and I warn they now while absent , as I do when present on my second visit , that if I come again I will not be lenient ,       since you be look for proof of Christ speak in I . he be not weak toward you but powerful in you .      for indeed he be crucify out of weakness , but he live by the power of God . so also we be weak in he , but toward you we shall live with he by the power of God .      examine yourself to see whether you be live in faith . test yourself . do you not realize that Jesus Christ be in you?\xe2\x80\x94unless , of course , you fail the test .      I hope you will discover that we have not fail .      but we pray to God that you may not do evil , not that we may appear to have pass the test but that you may do what be right , even though we may seem to have fail .      for we can not do anything against the truth , but only for the truth .      for we rejoice when we be weak but you be strong . what we pray for be your improvement .       I be write this while I be away , so that when I come I may not have to be severe in virtue of the authority that the Lord have give I to build up and not to tear down .     finally , brother , rejoice . mend your way , encourage one another , agree with one another , live in peace , and the God of love and peace will be with you .      Greet one another with a holy kiss . all the holy one greet you .      the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the holy Spirit be with all of you .
