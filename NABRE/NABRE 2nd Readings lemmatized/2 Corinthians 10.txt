b ' iv . Pauls Defense of his Ministry    Accusation of weakness .      now I myself , Paul , urge you through the gentleness and clemency of Christ ,    I who be humble when face to face with you , but brave toward you when absent ,        I beg you that , when present , I may not have to be brave with that confidence with which I intend to act boldly against some who consider we as act accord to the flesh .      for , although we be in the flesh , we do not battle accord to the flesh ,        for the weapon of our battle be not of flesh but be enormously powerful , capable of destroy fortress . we destroy argument        and every pretension raise itself against the knowledge of God , and take every thought captive in obedience to Christ ,      and we be ready to punish every disobedience , once your obedience be complete .       look at what confront you . whoever be confident of belong to Christ should consider that as he belong to Christ , so do we .         and even if I should boast a little too much of our authority , which the Lord give for build you up and not for tear you down , I shall not be put to shame .       may I not seem as one frightening you through letter .      for someone will say , his letter be severe and forceful , but his bodily presence be weak , and his speech contemptible .        such a person must understand that what we be in word through letter when absent , that we also be in action when present .       not that we dare to class or compare ourselves with some of those who recommend themselves . but when they measure themselves by one another and compare themselves with one another , they be without understanding .        but we will not boast beyond measure but will keep to the limit    God have apportion we , namely , to reach even to you .      for we be not overreach ourselves , as though we do not reach you ; we indeed first come to you with the gospel of Christ .      we be not boast beyond measure , in other people labor ; yet our hope be that , as your faith increase , our influence among you may be greatly enlarge , within our proper limit ,      so that we may preach the gospel even beyond you , not boast of work already do in another sphere .         whoever boast , should boast in the Lord .        for it be not the one who recommend himself who be approve ,    but the one whom the Lord recommend .
