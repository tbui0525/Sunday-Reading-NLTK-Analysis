b '   Departure for Rome .      when it be decide that we should sail to Italy , they hand Paul and some other prisoner over to a centurion name Julius of the Cohort Augusta .        we go on board a ship from Adramyttium bind for port in the province of Asia and set sail . Aristarchus , a Macedonian from Thessalonica , be with we .        on the follow day we put in at Sidon where Julius be kind enough to allow Paul to visit his friend who take care of he .      from there we put out to sea and sail around the sheltered side of Cyprus because of the headwind ,      and cross the open sea off the coast of Cilicia and Pamphylia we come to Myra in Lycia .    Storm and Shipwreck .     there the centurion find an alexandrian ship that be sail to Italy and put we on board .      for many day we make little headway , arrive at Cnidus only with difficulty , and because the wind would not permit we to continue our course we sail for the sheltered side of Crete off Salmone .      we sail past it with difficulty and reach a place call Fair Havens , near which be the city of Lasea .     much time have now pass and sailing have become hazardous because the time of the fast    have already go by , so Paul warn they ,        man , I can see that this voyage will result in severe damage and heavy loss not only to the cargo and the ship , but also to our life .      the centurion , however , pay more attention to the pilot and to the owner of the ship than to what Paul say .      since the harbor be unfavorably situate for spend the winter , the majority plan to put out to sea from there in the hope of reach Phoenix , a port in Crete face west - northwest , there to spend the winter .     a south wind blow gently , and think they have attain their objective , they weigh anchor and sail along close to the coast of Crete .      before long an offshore wind of hurricane force call a northeaster strike .      since the ship be catch up in it and could not head into the wind we give way and let ourselves be drive .      we pass along the sheltered side of an island name Cauda and manage only with difficulty to get the dinghy under control .      they hoist it aboard , then use cable to undergird the ship . because of their fear that they would run aground on the shoal of Syrtis , they lower the drift anchor and be carry along in this way .      we be be pound by the storm so violently that the next day they jettison some cargo ,      and on the third day with their own hand they throw even the ship tackle overboard .      neither the sun nor the star be visible for many day , and no small storm rage . finally , all hope of our surviving be take away .     when many would no long eat , Paul stand among they and say , man , you should have take my advice and not have set sail from Crete and you would have avoid this disastrous loss .      I urge you now to keep up your courage ; not one of you will be lose , only the ship .      for last night an angel of the God to whom [ i ] belong and whom I serve stand by I      and say , do not be afraid , Paul . you be destine to stand before Caesar ; and behold , for your sake , God have grant safety to all who be sail with you .        therefore , keep up your courage , man ; I trust in God that it will turn out as I have be tell .      we be destine to run aground on some island .     on the fourteenth night , as we be still be drive about on the Adriatic Sea , toward midnight the sailor begin to suspect that they be near land .      they take sounding and find twenty fathom ; a little far on , they again take sounding and find fifteen fathom .      fear that we would run aground on a rocky coast , they drop four anchor from the stern and pray for day to come .      the sailor then try to abandon ship ; they lower the dinghy to the sea on the pretext of go to lay out anchor from the bow .      but Paul say to the centurion and the soldier , unless these man stay with the ship , you can not be save .      so the soldier cut the rope of the dinghy and set it adrift .     until the day begin to dawn , Paul keep urge all to take some food . he say , today be the fourteenth day that you have be wait , go hungry and eat nothing .      I urge you , therefore , to take some food ; it will help you survive . not a hair of the head of anyone of you will be lose .      when he say this , he take bread ,    give thank to God in front of they all , break it , and begin to eat .        they be all encourage , and take some food themselves .      in all , there be two hundred seventy - six of we on the ship .      after they have eat enough , they lighten the ship by throw the wheat into the sea .     when day come they do not recognize the land , but make out a bay with a beach . they plan to run the ship ashore on it , if they could .      so they cast off the anchor and abandon they to the sea , and at the same time they unfasten the line of the rudder , and hoist the foresail into the wind , they make for the beach .      but they strike a sandbar and run the ship aground . the bow be wedge in and could not be move , but the stern begin to break up under the pound [ of the wave ] .      the soldier plan to kill the prisoner so that none might swim away and escape ,      but the centurion want to save Paul and so keep they from carry out their plan . he order those who could swim to jump overboard first and get to the shore ,      and then the rest , some on plank , other on debris from the ship . in this way , all reach shore safely .
