b '   conclude admonition .     finally , my brother , rejoice    in the Lord . write the same thing to you be no burden for I but be a safeguard for you .     against Legalistic Teachers .      beware of the dog ! beware of the evil - worker !    beware of the mutilation !        for we be the circumcision ,    we who worship through the Spirit of God , who boast in Christ Jesus and do not put our confidence in flesh ,        although I myself have ground for confidence even in the flesh .   Pauls Autobiography .   if anyone else think he can be confident in flesh , all the more can I.      circumcise on the eighth day ,    of the race of Israel , of the tribe of Benjamin , a Hebrew of Hebrew parentage , in observance of the law a Pharisee ,        in zeal I persecute the church , in righteousness base on the law I be blameless .     righteousness from God .     [ but ] whatever gain I have , these I have come to consider a loss    because of Christ .        More than that , I even consider everything as a loss because of the supreme good of know Christ Jesus my Lord . for his sake I have accept the loss of all thing and I consider they so much rubbish , that I may gain Christ      and be find in he , not have any righteousness of my own base on the law but that which come through faith in Christ ,    the righteousness from God , depend on faith      to know he and the power of his resurrection and [ the ] sharing of his suffering by be conform to his death ,        if somehow I may attain the resurrection from the dead .

Wrong Conduct and our Goal .        join with other in be imitator of I ,    brother , and observe those who thus conduct themselves accord to the model you have in we .        for many , as I have often tell you and now tell you even in tear , conduct themselves as enemy of the cross of Christ .        their end be destruction . their God be their stomach ; their glory be in their shame . their mind be occupy with earthly thing .        but our citizenship    be in heaven , and from it we also await a savior , the Lord Jesus Christ .        he will change our lowly body to conform with his glorify body by the power that enable he also to bring all thing into subjection to himself .
