b '   the experience of the Ministry .      work together ,    then , we appeal to you not to receive the grace of God in vain .        for he say : in an acceptable time    I hear you ,   and on the day of salvation I help you .   behold , now be a very acceptable time ; behold , now be the day of salvation .       we cause no one to stumble    in anything , in order that no fault may be find with our ministry ;       on the contrary , in everything we commend ourselves as minister of God , through much endurance ,    in affliction , hardship , constraint ,        beating , imprisonment , riot , labor , vigil , fast ;         by purity , knowledge , patience , kindness , in a holy spirit , in unfeigned love ,        in truthful speech , in the power of God ; with weapon of righteousness at the right and at the left ;        through glory and dishonor , insult and praise . we be treat as deceiver and yet be truthful ;        as unrecognized and yet acknowledge ; as die and behold we live ; as chastise and yet not put to death ;        as sorrowful yet always rejoice ; as poor yet enrich many ; as have nothing and yet possess all thing .       we have speak frankly to you , Corinthians ; our heart be open wide .      you be not constrain by we ; you be constrain by your own affection .        as recompense in kind ( I speak as to my child ) , be open yourself .     call to Holiness .      do not be yoke with those who be different , with unbeliever .    for what partnership do righteousness and lawlessness have ? or what fellowship do light have with darkness ?      what accord have Christ with Beliar ? or what have a believer in common with an unbeliever ?       what agreement have the temple of God with idol ? for we be the temple of the live God ; as God say : I will live with they and move among they ,    and I will be their God   and they shall be my people .   therefore , come forth from they   and be separate , say the Lord , and touch nothing unclean ;   then I will receive you    and I will be a father to you ,   and you shall be son and daughter to I , say the Lord Almighty .
