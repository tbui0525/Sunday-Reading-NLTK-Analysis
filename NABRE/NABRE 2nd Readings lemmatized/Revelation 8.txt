b ' the Seven Trumpets .     when he break open the seventh seal , there be silence in heaven    for about half an hour .        and I see that the seven angel who stand before God be give seven trumpet .     the Gold Censer .     another angel come and stand at the altar ,    hold a gold censer . he be give a great quantity of incense to offer , along with the prayer of all the holy one , on the gold altar that be before the throne .        the smoke of the incense along with the prayer of the holy one go up before God from the hand of the angel .      then the angel take the censer , fill it with burn coal from the altar , and hurl it down to the earth . there be peal of thunder , rumbling , flash of lightning , and an earthquake .     the First Four Trumpets .     the seven angel who be hold the seven trumpet prepare to blow they .      when the first one blow his trumpet , there come hail and fire mix with blood , which be hurl down to the earth . a third of the land be burn up , along with a third of the tree and all green grass .       when the second angel blow his trumpet , something like a large burn mountain be hurl into the sea . a third of the sea turn to blood ,        a third of the creature live in the sea    die , and a third of the ship be wreck .     when the third angel blow his trumpet , a large star burn like a torch fall from the sky . it fall on a third of the river and on the spring of water .        the star be call Wormwood ,    and a third of all the water turn to wormwood . many people die from this water , because it be make bitter .      when the fourth angel blow his trumpet , a third of the sun , a third of the moon , and a third of the star be strike , so that a third of they become dark . the day lose its light for a third of the time , as do the night .      then I look again and hear an eagle fly high overhead cry out in a loud voice , Woe ! Woe ! Woe    to the inhabitant of the earth from the rest of the trumpet blast that the three angel be about to blow !             '
