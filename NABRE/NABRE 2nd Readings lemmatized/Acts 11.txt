b '   the Baptism of the Gentiles explain .      now the apostle and the brother who be in Judea hear that the Gentiles too have accept the word of God .      so when Peter go up to Jerusalem the circumcise believer confront he ,      say , you enter    the house of uncircumcised people and eat with they .      Peter begin and explain it to they step by step , say ,       I be at prayer in the city of Joppa when in a trance I have a vision , something resemble a large sheet come down , lower from the sky by its four corner , and it come to I .      look intently into it , I observe and see the four - legged animal of the earth , the wild beast , the reptile , and the bird of the sky .      I also hear a voice say to I , get up , Peter . slaughter and eat .      but I say , certainly not , sir , because nothing profane or unclean have ever enter my mouth .      but a second time a voice from heaven answer , what God have make clean , you be not to call profane .      this happen three time , and then everything be draw up again into the sky .      just then three man appear at the house where we be , who have be send to I from Caesarea .      the Spirit tell I to accompany they without discriminate . these six brother    also go with I , and we enter the mans house .      he relate to we how he have see [ the ] angel stand in his house , say , send someone to Joppa and summon Simon , who be call Peter ,        who will speak word to you by which you and all your household will be save .      as I begin to speak , the holy Spirit fall upon they as it have upon we at the beginning ,        and I remember the word of the Lord , how he have say , John baptize with water but you will be baptize with the holy Spirit .        if then God give they the same gift he give to we when we come to believe in the Lord Jesus Christ , who be I to be able to hinder God ?        when they hear this , they stop object and glorify God , say , God have then grant life - give repentance to the Gentiles too . the Church at Antioch .        now those who have be scatter by the persecution that arise because of Stephen go as far as Phoenicia , Cyprus , and Antioch , preach the word to no one but Jews .        there be some Cypriots and Cyrenians among they , however , who come to Antioch and begin to speak to the Greeks as well , proclaim the Lord Jesus .      the hand of the Lord be with they and a great number who believe turn to the Lord .      the news about they reach the ear of the church in Jerusalem , and they send Barnabas [ to go ] to Antioch .      when he arrive and see the grace of God , he rejoice and encourage they all to remain faithful to the Lord in firmness of heart ,      for he be a good man , fill with the holy Spirit and faith . and a large number of people be add to the Lord .      then he go to Tarsus to look for Saul ,      and when he have find he he bring he to Antioch . for a whole year they meet with the church and teach a large number of people , and it be in Antioch that the disciple be first call Christians .   the Prediction of Agabus .        at that time some prophet come down from Jerusalem to Antioch ,      and one of they name Agabus stand up and predict by the Spirit that there would be a severe famine all over the world , and it happen under Claudius .        so the disciple determine that , accord to ability ,    each should send relief to the brother who live in Judea .       this they do , send it to the presbyter in care of Barnabas and Saul .
