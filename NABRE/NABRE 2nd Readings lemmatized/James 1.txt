b '      James , a slave of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ , to the twelve tribe in the dispersion , greeting .     II . the value of Trials and Temptation Perseverance in Trial .      consider it all joy , my brother , when you encounter various trial ,        for you know that the testing    of your faith produce perseverance .      and let perseverance be perfect , so that you may be perfect and complete , lack in nothing .      but if any of you lack wisdom ,    he should ask God who give to all generously and ungrudgingly , and he will be give it .        but he should ask in faith , not doubt , for the one who doubt be like a wave of the sea that be drive and toss about by the wind .        for that person must not suppose that he will receive anything from the Lord ,      since he be a man of two mind , unstable in all his way .     the brother in lowly circumstance    should take pride in his high standing ,        and the rich one in his lowliness , for he will pass away like the flower of the field .        for the sun come up with its scorch heat and dry up the grass , its flower droop , and the beauty of its appearance vanish . so will the rich person fade away in the midst of his pursuit .    Temptation .      bless be the man who persevere in temptation ,    for when he have be prove he will receive the crown of life that he promise to those who love he .       no one experience temptation should say , I be be tempt by God ; for God be not subject to temptation to evil , and he himself tempt no one .        rather , each person be tempt when he be lure and entice by his own desire .      then desire conceive and bring forth sin , and when sin reach maturity it give birth to death .      do not be deceive , my beloved brother :      all good giving and every perfect gift    be from above , come down from the Father of light , with whom there be no alteration or shadow cause by change .       he will to give we birth by the word of truth that we may be a kind of firstfruit of his creature .     III . exhortation and warning Doers of the Word .     know this , my dear brother : everyone should be quick to hear ,    slow to speak , slow to wrath ,        for the wrath of a man do not accomplish the righteousness of God .        therefore , put away all filth and evil excess and humbly welcome the word that have be plant in you and be able to save your soul .      be doer of the word and not hearer only , delude yourself .        for if anyone be a hearer of the word and not a doer , he be like a man who look at his own face in a mirror .      he see himself , then go off and promptly forget what he look like .      but the one who peer into the perfect law    of freedom and persevere , and be not a hearer who forget but a doer who act , such a one shall be bless in what he do .       if anyone think he be religious and do not bridle his tongue    but deceive his heart , his religion be vain .        religion that be pure and undefiled before God and the Father be this : to care for orphan and widow    in their affliction and to keep oneself unstaine by the world .
