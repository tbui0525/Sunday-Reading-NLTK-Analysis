b '   the Angel with the Small Scroll .      then I see another mighty angel come down from heaven wrap in a cloud , with a halo around his head ; his face be like the sun and his foot be like pillar of fire .      in his hand he hold a small scroll that have be open . he place his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land ,        and then he cry out in a loud voice as a lion roar . when he cry out , the seven thunder    raise their voice , too .        when the seven thunder have speak , I be about to write it down ; but I hear a voice from heaven say , seal up what the seven thunder have speak , but do not write it down .      then the angel I see stand on the sea and on the land raise his right hand to heaven      and swear by the one who live forever and ever , who create heaven and earth and sea    and all that be in they , there shall be no more delay .        at the time when you hear the seventh angel blow his trumpet , the mysterious plan of God    shall be fulfil , as he promise to his servant the prophet .      then the voice that I have hear from heaven speak to I again and say , go , take the scroll that lie open in the hand of the angel who be stand on the sea and on the land .      so I go up to the angel and tell he to give I the small scroll . he say to I , take and swallow it . it will turn your stomach sour , but in your mouth it will taste as sweet    as honey .      I take the small scroll from the angel hand and swallow it . in my mouth it be like sweet honey , but when I have eat it , my stomach turn sour .        then someone say to I , you must prophesy again about many people , nation , tongue , and king .
