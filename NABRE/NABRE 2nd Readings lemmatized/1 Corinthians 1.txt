b '   Greeting .     Paul , call to be an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God ,    and Sosthenes our brother ,        to the church of God that be in Corinth , to you who have be sanctify in Christ Jesus , call to be holy , with all those everywhere who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , their Lord and our .        Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .    Thanksgiving .     I give thank to my God always on your account for the grace of God bestow on you in Christ Jesus ,      that in he you be enrich in every way , with all discourse and all knowledge ,      as the testimony    to Christ be confirm among you ,      so that you be not lack in any spiritual gift as you wait for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ .        he will keep you firm to the end , irreproachable on the day of our Lord Jesus [ Christ ] .        God be faithful , and by he you be call to fellowship with his Son , Jesus Christ our Lord .     II . disorder in the Corinthian Community A. Divisions in the Church   Groups and slogan .     I urge you , brother , in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , that all of you agree in what you say , and that there be no division among you , but that you be unite in the same mind and in the same purpose .        for it have be report to I about you , my brother , by Chloes people , that there be rivalry among you .      I mean that each of you be say , I belong to    Paul , or I belong to Apollos , or I belong to Cephas , or I belong to Christ .         be Christ divide ? be Paul crucify for you ? or be you baptize in the name of Paul ?      I give thank [ to God ] that I baptize none of you except Crispus and Gaius ,        so that no one can say you be baptize in my name .      ( I baptize the household of Stephanas also ; beyond that I do not know whether I baptize anyone else . )         for Christ do not send I to baptize but to preach the gospel , and not with the wisdom of human eloquence ,    so that the cross of Christ might not be empty of its meaning .     Paradox of the Cross .     the message of the cross be foolishness to those who be perish , but to we who be be save it be the power of God .        for it be write : I will destroy the wisdom of the wise ,   and the learning of the learn I will set aside .      where be the wise one ? where be the scribe ? where be the debater of this age ? have not God make the wisdom of the world foolish ?         for since in the wisdom of God the world do not come to know God through wisdom , it be the will of God through the foolishness of the proclamation to save those who have faith .      for Jews demand sign and Greeks look for wisdom ,        but we proclaim Christ crucify , a stumble block to Jews and foolishness to Gentiles ,        but to those who be call , Jews and Greeks alike , Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God .      for the foolishness of God be wise than human wisdom , and the weakness of God be strong than human strength . the Corinthians and Paul .        consider your own calling , brother . not many of you be wise by human standard , not many be powerful , not many be of noble birth .      rather , God choose the foolish of the world to shame the wise , and God choose the weak of the world to shame the strong ,        and God choose the lowly and despise of the world , those who count for nothing , to reduce to nothing those who be something ,      so that no human being might boast    before God .        it be due to he that you be in Christ Jesus , who become for we wisdom from God , as well as righteousness , sanctification , and redemption ,        so that , as it be write , whoever boast , should boast in the Lord .
