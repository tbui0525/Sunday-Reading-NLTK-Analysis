b '   to live and die for Christ .      welcome anyone who be weak in faith ,    but not for dispute over opinion .        one person believe that one may eat anything , while the weak person eat only vegetable .        the one who eat must not despise the one who abstain , and the one who abstain must not pass judgment on the one who eat ; for God have welcome he .        who be you to pass judgment on someone else servant ? before his own master he stand or fall . and he will be uphold , for the Lord be able to make he stand .        [ for ] one person consider one day more important than another , while another person consider all day alike .    let everyone be fully persuade in his own mind .        whoever observe the day , observe it for the Lord . also whoever eat , eat for the Lord , since he give thank to God ; while whoever abstain , abstain for the Lord and give thank to God .      none of we live for oneself , and no one die for oneself .      for if we live , we live for the Lord ,    and if we die , we die for the Lord ; so then , whether we live or die , we be the Lords .        for this be why Christ die and come to life , that he might be Lord of both the dead and the living .        why then do you judge your brother ? or you , why do you look down on your brother ? for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of God ;        for it be write : as I live , say the Lord , every knee shall bend before I ,   and every tongue shall give praise to God .      so [ then ] each of we shall give an account of himself [ to God ] .     consideration for the Weak Conscience .     then let we no long judge one another , but rather resolve never to put a stumble block or hindrance in the way of a brother .        I know and be convince in the Lord Jesus that nothing be unclean in itself ; still , it be unclean for someone who think it unclean .        if your brother be be hurt by what you eat , your conduct be no long in accord with love . do not because of your food destroy he for whom Christ die .        so do not let your good be revile .        for the kingdom of God be not a matter of food and drink , but of righteousness , peace , and joy in the holy Spirit ;        whoever serve Christ in this way be pleasing to God and approve by other .      let we    then pursue what lead to peace and to build up one another .        for the sake of food , do not destroy the work of God .    everything be indeed clean , but it be wrong for anyone to become a stumble block by eat ;      it be good not to eat meat or drink wine or do anything that cause your brother to stumble .      keep the faith [ that ] you have to yourself in the presence of God ; bless be the one who do not condemn himself for what he approve .       but whoever have doubt be condemn if he eat , because this be not from faith ; for whatever be not from faith be sin .
