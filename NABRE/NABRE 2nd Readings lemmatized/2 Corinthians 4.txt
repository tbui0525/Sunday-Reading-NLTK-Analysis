b '   Integrity in the Ministry .      therefore , since we have this ministry through the mercy show we , we be not discourage .      rather , we have renounce shameful , hidden thing ; not act deceitfully or falsify the word of God , but by the open declaration of the truth we commend ourselves to everyone conscience in the sight of God .        and even though our gospel be veil ,    it be veil for those who be perish ,        in whose case the god of this age have blind the mind of the unbeliever , so that they may not see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ , who be the image of God .        for we do not preach ourselves    but Jesus Christ as Lord , and ourselves as your slave for the sake of Jesus .       for God who say , let light shine out of darkness , have shine in our heart to bring to light the knowledge of the glory of God on the face of [ Jesus ] Christ .     the Paradox of the Ministry .      but we hold this treasure    in earthen vessel , that the surpass power may be of God and not from we .       we be afflict in every way , but not constrain ; perplexed , but not drive to despair ;        persecute , but not abandon ; strike down , but not destroy ;        always carry about in the body the dying of Jesus , so that the life of Jesus may also be manifest in our body .      for we who live be constantly be give up to death for the sake of Jesus , so that the life of Jesus may be manifest in our mortal flesh .       so death be at work in we , but life in you .       since , then , we have the same spirit of faith , accord to what be write , I believe , therefore I speak , we too believe and therefore speak ,        know that the one who raise the Lord Jesus will raise we also with Jesus and place we with you in his presence .        everything indeed be for you , so that the grace bestow in abundance on more and more people may cause the thanksgiving to overflow for the glory of God .       therefore , we be not discourage ;    rather , although our outer self be waste away , our inner self be be renew day by day .        for this momentary light affliction be produce for we an eternal weight of glory beyond all comparison ,        as we look not to what be see but to what be unseen ; for what be see be transitory , but what be unseen be eternal .
