b '   the coming of the Spirit .      when the time for Pentecost be fulfil , they be all in one place together .        and suddenly there come from the sky a noise like a strong driving wind ,    and it fill the entire house in which they be .        then there appear to they tongue as of fire ,    which part and come to rest on each one of they .        and they be all fill with the holy Spirit and begin to speak in different tongue ,    as the Spirit enable they to proclaim .      now there be devout Jews from every nation under heaven stay in Jerusalem .      at this sound , they gather in a large crowd , but they be confused because each one hear they speak in his own language .      they be astounded , and in amazement they ask , be not all these people who be speak Galileans ?        then how do each of we hear they in his own native language ?      we be Parthians , Medes , and Elamites , inhabitant of Mesopotamia , Judea and Cappadocia , Pontus and Asia ,      Phrygia and Pamphylia , Egypt and the district of Libya near Cyrene , as well as traveler from Rome ,      both Jews and convert to judaism , Cretans and Arabs , yet we hear they speak in our own tongue of the mighty act of God .        they be all astounded and bewildered , and say to one another , what do this mean ?      but other say , scoff , they have have too much new wine .      Peters Speech at Pentecost .      then Peter stand up with the Eleven , raise his voice , and proclaim to they , you who be Jews , indeed all of you stay in Jerusalem . let this be know to you , and listen to my word .      these people be not drunk , as you suppose , for it be only nine oclock in the morning .      no , this be what be speak through the prophet Joel :     it will come to pass in the last day , God say ,   that I will pour out a portion of my spirit   upon all flesh . your son and your daughter shall prophesy ,   your young man shall see vision ,   your old man shall dream dream .    indeed , upon my servant and my handmaid   I will pour out a portion of my spirit in those day ,   and they shall prophesy .   and I will work wonder in the heaven above   and sign on the earth below :   blood , fire , and a cloud of smoke .   the sun shall be turn to darkness ,   and the moon to blood ,   before the coming of the great and splendid day of the Lord ,   and it shall be that everyone shall be save who call on the name of the Lord .      you who be Israelites , hear these word . Jesus the Nazorean be a man commend to you by God with mighty deed , wonder , and sign , which God work through he in your midst , as you yourselves know .        this man , deliver up by the set plan and foreknowledge of God , you kill , use lawless man to crucify he .        but God raise he up , release he from the throe of death , because it be impossible for he to be hold by it .        for David say of he : I see the Lord ever before I ,    with he at my right hand I shall not be disturb .   therefore my heart have be glad and my tongue have exult ;   my flesh , too , will dwell in hope ,   because you will not abandon my soul to the netherworld ,   nor will you suffer your holy one to see corruption .    you have make known to I the path of life ;   you will fill I with joy in your presence .     my brother , one can confidently say to you about the patriarch David that he die and be bury , and his tomb be in our midst to this day .      but since he be a prophet and know that God have swear an oath to he that he would set one of his descendant upon his throne ,        he foresaw and speak of the resurrection of the Messiah , that neither be he abandon to the netherworld nor do his flesh see corruption .        God raise this Jesus ; of this we be all witness .      exalt at the right hand of God ,    he receive the promise of the holy Spirit from the Father and pour it forth , as you [ both ] see and hear .        for David do not go up into heaven , but he himself say : the Lord say to my Lord , sit at my right hand     until I make your enemy your footstool .     therefore let the whole house of Israel know for certain that God have make he both Lord and Messiah , this Jesus whom you crucify .      now when they hear this , they be cut to the heart , and they ask Peter and the other apostle , what be we to do , my brother ?        Peter [ say ] to they , repent and be baptize ,    every one of you , in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sin ; and you will receive the gift of the holy Spirit .        for the promise be make to you and to your child and to all those far off , whomever the Lord our God will call .        he testify with many other argument , and be exhort they , save yourself from this corrupt generation .        those who accept his message be baptize , and about three thousand person be add that day .   Communal Life .         they devote themselves to the teaching of the apostle and to the communal life , to the breaking of the bread and to the prayer .        Awe come upon everyone , and many wonder and sign be do through the apostle .        all who believe be together and have all thing in common ;        they would sell their property and possession and divide they among all accord to each one need .      every day they devote themselves to meet together in the temple area and to break bread in their home . they eat their meal with exultation and sincerity of heart ,      praise God and enjoy favor with all the people . and every day the Lord add to their number those who be be save .
