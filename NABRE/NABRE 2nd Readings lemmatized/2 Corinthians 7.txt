b '    since we have these promise , belove , let we cleanse ourselves from every defilement of flesh and spirit , make holiness perfect in the fear of God .      make room for we ; we have not wrong anyone , or ruin anyone , or take advantage of anyone .      I do not say this in condemnation , for I have already say that you be in our heart , that we may die together and live together .        I have great confidence in you , I have great pride in you ; I be fill with encouragement , I be overflow with joy all the more because of all our affliction .    C. Resolution of the Crisis   Pauls Joy in Macedonia .      for even when we come into Macedonia ,    our flesh have no rest , but we be afflict in every way\xe2\x80\x94external conflict , internal fear .        but God , who encourage the downcast , encourage we by the arrival of Titus ,        and not only by his arrival but also by the encouragement with which he be encourage in regard to you , as he tell we of your yearning , your lament , your zeal for I , so that I rejoice even more .       for even if I sadden you by my letter , I do not regret it ; and if I do regret it ( [ for ] I see that that letter sadden you , if only for a while ) ,        I rejoice now , not because you be sadden , but because you be sadden into repentance ; for you be sadden in a godly way , so that you do not suffer loss in anything because of we .      for godly sorrow produce a salutary repentance without regret , but worldly sorrow produce death .      for behold what earnestness this godly sorrow have produce for you , as well as readiness for a defense , and indignation , and fear , and yearning , and zeal , and punishment . in every way you have show yourself to be innocent in the matter .      so then even though I write to you , it be not on account of the one who do the wrong , or on account of the one who suffer the wrong , but in order that your concern for we might be make plain to you in the sight of God .        for this reason we be encourage . and besides our encouragement ,    we rejoice even more because of the joy of Titus , since his spirit have be refresh by all of you .      for if I have boast to he about you , I be not put to shame . no , just as everything we say to you be true , so our boasting before Titus prove to be the truth .      and his heart go out to you all the more , as he remember the obedience of all of you , when you receive he with fear and trembling .        I rejoice , because I have confidence in you in every respect .             '
