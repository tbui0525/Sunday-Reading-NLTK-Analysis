b '   the Fifth Trumpet .      then the fifth angel blow his trumpet , and I see a star    that have fall from the sky to the earth . it be give the key for the passage to the abyss .      it open the passage to the abyss ,    and smoke come up out of the passage like smoke from a huge furnace . the sun and the air be darken by the smoke from the passage .        locust come out of the smoke onto the land , and they be give the same power as scorpion    of the earth .        they be tell not to harm the grass of the earth or any plant or any tree , but only those people who do not have the seal of God on their forehead .      they be not allow to kill they but only to torment they for five month ;    the torment they inflict be like that of a scorpion when it sting a person .      during that time these people will seek death but will not find it , and they will long to die but death will escape they .       the appearance of the locust be like that of horse ready for battle . on their head they wear what look like crown of gold ; their face be like human face ,        and they have hair like women hair . their tooth be like lion tooth ,        and they have chest like iron breastplate . the sound of their wing be like the sound of many horse - draw chariot race into battle .      they have tail like scorpion , with stinger ; with their tail they have power to harm people for five month .      they have as their king the angel of the abyss , whose name in Hebrew be Abaddon    and in Greek Apollyon .     the first woe have pass , but there be two more to come . the Sixth Trumpet .        then the sixth angel blow his trumpet , and I hear a voice come from the [ four ]    horn of the gold altar before God ,        tell the sixth angel who hold the trumpet , release the four angel    who be bind at the bank of the great river Euphrates .      so the four angel be release , who be prepare for this hour , day , month , and year to kill a third of the human race .      the number of cavalry troop be two hundred million ; I hear their number .      now in my vision this be how I see the horse and their rider . they wear red , blue , and yellow breastplate ,    and the horse head be like head of lion , and out of their mouth come fire , smoke , and sulfur .        by these three plague of fire , smoke , and sulfur that come out of their mouth a third of the human race be kill .      for the power of the horse be in their mouth and in their tail ; for their tail be like snake , with head that inflict harm .     the rest of the human race , who be not kill by these plague , do not repent of the work of their hand ,    to give up the worship of demon and idol make from gold , silver , bronze , stone , and wood , which can not see or hear or walk .        nor do they repent of their murder , their magic potion , their unchastity , or their robbery .
