b '   the remnant of Israel .      I ask , then , have God reject his people ? of course not !    for I too be an Israelite , a descendant of Abraham , of the tribe of Benjamin .        God have not reject his people whom he foreknew . do you not know what the scripture say about Elijah , how he plead with God against Israel ?      Lord , they have kill your prophet , they have tear down your altar , and I alone be leave , and they be seek my life .        but what be Gods response to he ? I have leave for myself seven thousand man who have not kneel to Baal .        so also at the present time there be a remnant , choose by grace .        but if by grace , it be no long because of work ; otherwise grace would no long be grace .        what then ? what Israel be seek it do not attain , but the elect attain it ; the rest be harden ,        as it be write : God give they a spirit of deep sleep ,   eye that should not see   and ear that should not hear , down to this very day .      and David say :   let their table become a snare and a trap ,   a stumble block and a retribution for they ;   let their eye grow dim so that they may not see ,   and keep their back bent forever .    the Gentiles Salvation .      hence I ask , do they stumble so as to fall ? of course not ! but through their transgression salvation have come to the Gentiles , so as to make they jealous .        now if their transgression be enrichment for the world , and if their diminished number be enrichment for the Gentiles , how much more their full number .     now I be speak to you Gentiles . inasmuch then as I be the apostle to the Gentiles , I glory in my ministry        in order to make my race jealous and thus save some of they .      for if their rejection be the reconciliation of the world , what will their acceptance be but life from the dead ?       if the firstfruit be holy , so be the whole batch of dough ; and if the root be holy , so be the branch .      but if some of the branch be break off , and you , a wild olive shoot , be graft in their place and have come to share in the rich root of the olive tree ,        do not boast against the branch . if you do boast , consider that you do not support the root ; the root support you .        indeed you will say , branch be break off so that I might be graft in .      that be so . they be break off because of unbelief , but you be there because of faith . so do not become haughty , but stand in awe .        for if God do not spare the natural branch , [ perhaps ] he will not spare you either .        see , then , the kindness and severity of God : severity toward those who fall , but Gods kindness to you , provide you remain in his kindness ; otherwise you too will be cut off .        and they also , if they do not remain in unbelief , will be graft in , for God be able to graft they in again .        for if you be cut from what be by nature a wild olive tree , and graft , contrary to nature , into a cultivate one , how much more will they who belong to it by nature be graft back into their own olive tree . Gods Irrevocable Call .        I do not want you to be unaware of this mystery , brother , so that you will not become wise [ in ] your own estimation : a hardening have come upon Israel in part , until the full number of the Gentiles come in ,        and thus all Israel will be save ,    as it be write :   the deliverer will come out of Zion ,   he will turn away godlessness from Jacob ;   and this be my covenant with they   when I take away their sin .      in respect to the gospel , they be enemy on your account ; but in respect to election , they be beloved because of the patriarch .        for the gift and the call of God be irrevocable .     Triumph of Gods Mercy .      just as you once disobey God but have now receive mercy because of their disobedience ,      so they have now disobey in order that , by virtue of the mercy show to you , they too may [ now ] receive mercy .      for God deliver all to disobedience , that he might have mercy upon all .       oh , the depth of the rich and wisdom and knowledge of God ! how inscrutable be his judgment and how unsearchable his way !      for who have know the mind of the Lord    or who have be his counselor ?     or who have give he anything    that he may be repay ?     for from he and through he and for he be all thing . to he be glory forever . amen .
