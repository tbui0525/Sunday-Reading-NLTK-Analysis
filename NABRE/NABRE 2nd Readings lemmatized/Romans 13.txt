b '   obedience to Authority .      let every person be subordinate to the high authority , for there be no authority except from God , and those that exist have be establish by God .        therefore , whoever resist authority oppose what God have appoint , and those who oppose it will bring judgment upon themselves .      for ruler be not a cause of fear to good conduct , but to evil .    do you wish to have no fear of authority ? then do what be good and you will receive approval from it ,      for it be a servant of God for your good . but if you do evil , be afraid , for it do not bear the sword without purpose ; it be the servant of God to inflict wrath on the evildoer .        therefore , it be necessary to be subject not only because of the wrath but also because of conscience .        this be why you also pay taxis , for the authority be minister of God , devote themselves to this very thing .      pay to all their due , taxis to whom taxis be due , toll to whom toll be due , respect to whom respect be due , honor to whom honor be due .   Love Fulfills the Law .        Owe nothing to anyone , except to love one another ; for the one who love another have fulfil the law .        the commandment , you shall not commit adultery ; you shall not kill ; you shall not steal ; you shall not covet , and whatever other commandment there may be , be sum up in this saying , [ namely ] you shall love your neighbor as yourself .        Love do no evil to the neighbor ; hence , love be the fulfillment of the law .   awareness of the end of Time .        and do this because you know the time ; it be the hour now for you to awake from sleep . for our salvation be near now than when we first believe ;        the night be advance , the day be at hand . let we then throw off the work of darkness [ and ] put on the armor of light ;        let we conduct ourselves properly as in the day ,    not in orgy and drunkenness , not in promiscuity and licentiousness , not in rivalry and jealousy .        but put on the Lord Jesus Christ , and make no provision for the desire of the flesh .
