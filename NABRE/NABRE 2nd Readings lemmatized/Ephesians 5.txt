b '    so be imitator of God ,    as beloved child ,        and live in love , as Christ love we and hand himself over for we as a sacrificial offering to God for a fragrant aroma .        Immorality or any impurity or greed must not even be mention among you , as be fit among holy one ,        no obscenity or silly or suggestive talk , which be out of place , but instead , thanksgive .        be sure of this , that no immoral or impure or greedy person , that is , an idolater , have any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God .     duty to live in the Light .      let no one deceive you with empty argument , for because of these thing the wrath of God be come upon the disobedient .        so do not be associate with they .      for you be once darkness , but now you be light in the Lord . live as child of light ,        for light produce every kind of goodness and righteousness and truth .        try to learn what be pleasing to the Lord .        take no part in the fruitless work of darkness ; rather expose they ,        for it be shameful even to mention the thing do by they in secret ;      but everything expose by the light become visible ,        for everything that become visible be light . therefore , it say :   Awake , o sleeper ,   and arise from the dead , and Christ will give you light .       watch carefully then how you live , not as foolish person but as wise ,        make the most of the opportunity , because the day be evil .      therefore , do not continue in ignorance , but try to understand what be the will of the Lord .      and do not get drunk on wine , in which lie debauchery , but be fill with the Spirit ,        address one another [ in ] psalm and hymn and spiritual song , singe and play to the Lord in your heart ,        give thank always and for everything in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God the Father .     wife and husband .      be subordinate to one another    out of reverence for Christ .        wife should be subordinate to their husband as to the Lord .        for the husband be head of his wife just as Christ be head of the church , he himself the savior of the body .        as the church be subordinate to Christ , so wife should be subordinate to their husband in everything .      husband , love your wife , even as Christ love the church and hand himself over for she        to sanctify she , cleanse she by the bath of water with the word ,        that he might present to himself the church in splendor , without spot or wrinkle or any such thing , that she might be holy and without blemish .        so [ also ] husband should love their wife as their own body . he who love his wife love himself .      for no one hate his own flesh but rather nourish and cherish it , even as Christ do the church ,      because we be member of his body .      for this reason a man shall leave [ his ] father and [ his ] mother   and be join to his wife , and the two shall become one flesh .      this be a great mystery , but I speak in reference to Christ and the church .        in any case , each one of you should love his wife as himself , and the wife should respect her husband .
