b '   Gods just Judgment .      therefore , you be without excuse ,    every one of you who pass judgment .    for by the standard by which you judge another you condemn yourself , since you , the judge , do the very same thing .      we know that the judgment of God on those who do such thing be true .      do you suppose , then , you who judge those who engage in such thing and yet do they yourself , that you will escape the judgment of God ?        or do you hold his priceless kindness , forbearance , and patience in low esteem , unaware that the kindness of God would lead you to repentance ?        by your stubbornness and impenitent heart ,    you be store up wrath for yourself for the day of wrath and revelation of the just judgment of God ,       who will repay everyone accord to his work :        eternal life to those who seek glory , honor , and immortality through perseverance in good work ,      but wrath and fury to those who selfishly disobey the truth and obey wickedness .        yes , affliction and distress will come upon every human being who do evil , Jew first and then Greek .       but there will be glory , honor , and peace for everyone who do good , Jew first and then Greek .        there be no partiality with God . judgment by the Interior Law .        all who sin outside the law will also perish without reference to it , and all who sin under the law will be judge in accordance with it .        for it be not those who hear the law who be just in the sight of God ; rather , those who observe the law will be justify .        for when the Gentiles who do not have the law by nature observe the prescription of the law , they be a law for themselves even though they do not have the law .        they show that the demand of the law be write in their heart ,    while their conscience also bear witness and their conflicting thought accuse or even defend they      on the day when , accord to my gospel , God will judge people hide work through Christ Jesus .   judgment by the Mosaic Law .        now if you call yourself a Jew and rely on the law and boast of God        and know his will and be able to discern what be important since you be instruct from the law ,        and if you be confident that you be a guide for the blind and a light for those in darkness ,        that you be a trainer of the foolish and teacher of the simple ,    because in the law you have the formulation of knowledge and truth\xe2\x80\x94      then you who teach another , be you fail to teach yourself ? you who preach against stealing , do you steal ?        you who forbid adultery , do you commit adultery ? you who detest idol , do you rob temple ?      you who boast of the law , do you dishonor God by break the law ?       for , as it be write , because of you the name of God be revile among the Gentiles .       Circumcision , to be sure , have value if you observe the law ; but if you break the law , your circumcision have become uncircumcision .        again , if an uncircumcised man keep the precept of the law , will he not be consider circumcise ?        indeed , those who be physically uncircumcised but carry out the law will pass judgment on you , with your write law and circumcision , who break the law .      one be not a Jew outwardly . true circumcision be not outward , in the flesh .        rather , one be a Jew inwardly , and circumcision be of the heart , in the spirit , not the letter ; his praise be not from human being but from God .
