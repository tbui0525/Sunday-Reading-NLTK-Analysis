b '   King Agrippa hear Paul .     then Agrippa say to Paul , you may now speak on your own behalf . so Paul stretch out his hand and begin his defense .       I count myself fortunate , King Agrippa , that I be to defend myself before you today against all the charge make against I by the Jews ,      especially since you be an expert in all the jewish custom and controversy . and therefore I beg you to listen patiently .      my manner of live from my youth , a life spend from the beginning among my people    and in Jerusalem , all [ the ] Jews know .       they have know about I from the start , if they be willing to testify , that I have live my life as a Pharisee , the strict party of our religion .       but now I be stand trial because of my hope in the promise make by God to our ancestor .      our twelve tribe hope to attain to that promise as they fervently worship God day and night ; and on account of this hope I be accuse by Jews , o king .      why be it think unbelievable among you that God raise the dead ?       I myself once think that I have to do many thing against the name of Jesus the Nazorean ,      and I do so in Jerusalem . I imprison many of the holy one with the authorization I receive from the chief priest , and when they be to be put to death I cast my vote against they .        many time , in synagogue after synagogue , I punish they in an attempt to force they to blaspheme ; I be so enraged against they that I pursue they even to foreign city .     on one such occasion I be travel to Damascus with the authorization and commission of the chief priest .       at midday , along the way , o king , I see a light from the sky , bright than the sun , shine around I and my travel companion .        we all fall to the ground and I hear a voice say to I in Hebrew , Saul , Saul , why be you persecute I ?    it be hard for you to kick against the goad .        and I say , who be you , sir ? and the Lord reply , I be Jesus whom you be persecute .        get up now , and stand on your foot .    I have appear to you for this purpose , to appoint you as a servant and witness of what you have see [ of I ] and what you will be show .        I shall deliver you from this people and from the Gentiles to whom I send you ,        to open their eye    that they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God , so that they may obtain forgiveness of sin and an inheritance among those who have be consecrate by faith in I .      and so , King Agrippa , I be not disobedient to the heavenly vision .      on the contrary , first to those in Damascus and in Jerusalem and throughout the whole country of Judea , and then to the Gentiles , I preach the need to repent and turn to God , and to do work give evidence of repentance .       that be why the Jews seize I [ when I be ] in the temple and try to kill I .       but I have enjoy Gods help to this very day , and so I stand here testify to small and great alike , say nothing different from what the prophet and Moses foretell ,        that the Messiah must suffer    and that , as the first to rise from the dead , he would proclaim light both to our people and to the Gentiles .     reaction to Pauls Speech .     while Paul be so speak in his defense , Festus say in a loud voice , you be mad , Paul ; much learning be drive you mad .      but Paul reply , I be not mad , most excellent Festus ; I be speak word of truth and reason .      the king know about these matter and to he I speak boldly , for I can not believe that [ any ] of this have escape his notice ; this be not do in a corner .        King Agrippa , do you believe the prophet ?    I know you believe .      then Agrippa say to Paul , you will soon persuade I to play the Christian .      Paul reply , I would pray to God that soon or later not only you but all who listen to I today might become as I be except for these chain .     then the king rise , and with he the governor and Bernice and the other who sit with they .       and after they have withdraw they say to one another , this man be do nothing [ at all ] that deserve death or imprisonment .      and Agrippa say to Festus , this man could have be set free if he have not appeal to Caesar .
