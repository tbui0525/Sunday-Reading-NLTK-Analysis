b '    Greeting .      Paul , a slave of God and apostle of Jesus Christ for the sake of the faith of Gods choose one and the recognition of religious truth ,        in the hope of eternal life that God , who do not lie , promise before time begin ,        who indeed at the proper time reveal his word in the proclamation with which I be entrust by the command of God our savior ,        to Titus , my true child in our common faith : grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our savior .     II . Pastoral Charge Titus in Crete .      for this reason I leave you in Crete so that you might set right what remain to be do and appoint presbyter in every town , as I direct you ,       on condition that a man be blameless , marry only once , with believe child who be not accuse of licentiousness or rebellious .      for a bishop as Gods steward must be blameless , not arrogant , not irritable , not a drunkard , not aggressive , not greedy for sordid gain ,      but hospitable , a lover of goodness , temperate , just , holy , and self - control ,      hold fast to the true message as teach so that he will be able both to exhort with sound doctrine and to refute opponent .         for there be also many rebel , idle talker and deceiver , especially the jewish Christians .        it be imperative to silence they , as they be upset whole family by teach for sordid gain what they should not .      one of they , a prophet of their own , once say , Cretans have always be liar , vicious beast , and lazy glutton .        that testimony be true . therefore , admonish they sharply , so that they may be sound in the faith ,        instead of pay attention to jewish myth and regulation of people who have repudiate the truth .        to the clean all thing be clean , but to those who be defile and unbelieving nothing be clean ; in fact , both their mind and their conscience be taint .        they claim to know God , but by their deed they deny he . they be vile and disobedient and unqualified for any good deed .
