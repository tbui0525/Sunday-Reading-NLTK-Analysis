b '   our Future Destiny .      for we know that if our earthly dwelling ,    a tent , should be destroy , we have a building from God , a dwelling not make with hand , eternal in heaven .       for in this tent we groan , longing to be far clothe with our heavenly habitation        if indeed , when we have take it off ,    we shall not be find naked .      for while we be in this tent we groan and be weigh down , because we do not wish to be unclothed    but to be far clothe , so that what be mortal may be swallow up by life .        now the one who have prepare we for this very thing be God ,    who have give we the Spirit as a first installment .       so we be always courageous , although we know that while we be at home in the body we be away from the Lord ,      for we walk by faith , not by sight .      yet we be courageous , and we would rather leave the body and go home to the Lord .        therefore , we aspire to please he , whether we be at home or away .      for we must all appear    before the judgment seat of Christ , so that each one may receive recompense , accord to what he do in the body , whether good or evil .     the Ministry of Reconciliation .      therefore , since we know the fear of the Lord , we try to persuade other ; but we be clearly apparent to God , and I hope we be also apparent to your consciousness .        we be not commend ourselves to you again but give you an opportunity to boast of we , so that you may have something to say to those who boast of external appearance rather than of the heart .        for if we be out of our mind ,    it be for God ; if we be rational , it be for you .       for the love of Christ impel we , once we have come to the conviction that one die for all ; therefore , all have die .        he indeed die for all , so that those who live might no long live for themselves but for he who for their sake die and be raise .      consequently ,    from now on we regard no one accord to the flesh ; even if we once know Christ accord to the flesh , yet now we know he so no long .       so whoever be in Christ be a new creation : the old thing have pass away ; behold , new thing have come .       and all this be from God , who have reconcile we to himself through Christ and give we the ministry of reconciliation ,      namely , God be reconcile the world to himself in Christ , not count their trespass against they and entrust to we the message of reconciliation .        so we be ambassador for Christ , as if God be appeal through we . we implore you on behalf of Christ , be reconcile to God .         for our sake he make he to be sin who do not know sin ,    so that we might become the righteousness of God in he .
