b '    Paul look intently at the Sanhedrin and say , my brother , I have conduct myself with a perfectly clear conscience before God to this day .        the high priest Ananias    order his attendant to strike his mouth .      then Paul say to he , God will strike you ,    you whitewash wall . do you indeed sit in judgment upon I accord to the law and yet in violation of the law order I to be strike ?        the attendant say , would you revile Gods high priest ?      Paul answer , Brothers , I do not realize he be the high priest . for it be write ,    you shall not curse a ruler of your people .      Paul be aware that some be Sadducees and some Pharisees , so he call out before the Sanhedrin , my brother , I be a Pharisee , the son of Pharisees ; [ i ] be on trial for hope in the resurrection of the dead .        when he say this , a dispute break out between the Pharisees and Sadducees , and the group become divided .      for the Sadducees say that there be no resurrection or angel or spirit , while the Pharisees acknowledge all three .        a great uproar occur , and some scribe belong to the Pharisee party stand up and sharply argue , we find nothing wrong with this man . suppose a spirit or an angel have speak to he ?      the dispute be so serious that the commander , afraid that Paul would be tear to piece by they , order his troop to go down and rescue he from their midst and take he into the compound .        the following night the Lord stand by he and say , take courage . for just as you have bear witness to my cause in Jerusalem , so you must also bear witness in Rome .    transfer to Caesarea .     when day come , the Jews make a plot and bind themselves by oath not to eat or drink until they have kill Paul .      there be more than forty who form this conspiracy .      they go to the chief priest and elder and say , we have bind ourselves by a solemn oath to taste nothing until we have kill Paul .      you , together with the Sanhedrin , must now make an official request to the commander to have he bring he down to you , as though you mean to investigate his case more thoroughly . we on our part be prepared to kill he before he arrive .      the son of Pauls sister , however , hear about the ambush ; so he go and enter the compound and report it to Paul .      Paul then call one of the centurion    and request , take this young man to the commander ; he have something to report to he .      so he take he and bring he to the commander and explain , the prisoner Paul call I and ask that I bring this young man to you ; he have something to say to you .      the commander take he by the hand , draw he aside , and ask he privately , what be it you have to report to I ?      he reply , the Jews have conspire to ask you to bring Paul down to the Sanhedrin tomorrow , as though they mean to inquire about he more thoroughly ,      but do not believe they . More than forty of they be lie in wait for he ; they have bind themselves by oath not to eat or drink until they have kill he . they be now ready and only wait for your consent .      as the commander dismiss the young man he direct he , tell no one that you give I this information .     then he summon two of the centurion and say , get two hundred soldier ready to go to Caesarea by nine oclock tonight ,    along with seventy horseman and two hundred auxiliary .      provide mount for Paul to ride and give he safe conduct to Felix the governor .      then he write a letter with this content :       Claudius Lysias to his excellency the governor Felix , greeting .        this man , seize by the Jews and about to be murder by they , I rescue after intervene with my troop when I learn that he be a roman citizen .        I want to learn the reason for their accusation against he so I bring he down to their Sanhedrin .      I discover that he be accuse in matter of controversial question of their law and not of any charge deserve death or imprisonment .        since it be bring to my attention that there will be a plot against the man , I be send he to you at once , and have also notify his accuser to state [ their case ] against he before you .     so the soldier , accord to their order , take Paul and escort he by night to Antipatris .      the next day they return to the compound , leave the horseman to complete the journey with he .      when they arrive in Caesarea they deliver the letter to the governor and present Paul to he .      when he have read it and ask to what province he belong , and learn that he be from Cilicia ,      he say , I shall hear your case when your accuser arrive . then he order that he be hold in custody in Herods praetorium .
