b ' Pauls Rights as an Apostle .     be I not free ? be I not an apostle ? have I not see Jesus our Lord ? be you not my work in the Lord ?        although I may not be an apostle for other , certainly I be for you , for you be the seal of my apostleship in the Lord .     my defense against those who would pass judgment on I    be this .       do we not have the right to eat and drink ?      do we not have the right to take along a christian wife , as do the rest of the apostle , and the brother of the Lord , and Cephas ?      or be it only myself and Barnabas who do not have the right not to work ?        who ever serve as a soldier at his own expense ? who plant a vineyard without eat its produce ? or who shepherd a flock without use some of the milk from the flock ?        be I say this on human authority , or do not the law also speak of these thing ?      it be write in the law of Moses , you shall not muzzle an ox while it be tread out the grain .    be God concerned about oxen ,      or be he not really speak for our sake ? it be write for our sake , because the plowman should plow in hope , and the thresher in hope of receive a share .        if we have sow spiritual seed for you , be it a great thing that we reap a material harvest from you ?        if other share this rightful claim on you , do not we still more ?   reason for not use his right .   yet we have not use this right .    on the contrary , we endure everything so as not to place an obstacle to the gospel of Christ .       do you not know that those who perform the temple service eat [ what ] belong to the temple , and those who minister at the altar share in the sacrificial offering ?        in the same way , the Lord order that those who preach the gospel should live by the gospel .       I have not use any of these right , however , nor do I write this that it be do so in my case . I would rather die . certainly no one be go to nullify my boast .        if I preach the gospel , this be no reason for I to boast , for an obligation have be impose on I , and woe to I if I do not preach it !        if I do so willingly , I have a recompense , but if unwillingly , then I have be entrust with a stewardship .        what then be my recompense ? that , when I preach , I offer the gospel free of charge so as not to make full use of my right in the gospel .     all thing to all .      although I be free in regard to all , I have make myself a slave to all so as to win over as many as possible .        to the Jews I become like a Jew to win over Jews ; to those under the law I become like one under the law\xe2\x80\x94though I myself be not under the law\xe2\x80\x94to win over those under the law .      to those outside the law I become like one outside the law\xe2\x80\x94though I be not outside Gods law but within the law of Christ\xe2\x80\x94to win over those outside the law .      to the weak I become weak , to win over the weak . I have become all thing to all , to save at least some .        all this I do for the sake of the gospel , so that I too may have a share in it .      do you not know that the runner in the stadium all run in the race , but only one win the prize ? run so as to win .        every athlete exercise discipline in every way . they do it to win a perishable crown , but we an imperishable one .        thus I do not run aimlessly ; I do not fight as if I be shadowbox .      no , I drive my body and train it , for fear that , after having preach to other , I myself should be disqualify .
