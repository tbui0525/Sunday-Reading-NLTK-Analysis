b '   the Woman and the Dragon .      a great sign appear in the sky , a woman    clothe with the sun , with the moon under her foot , and on her head a crown of twelve star .        she be with child and wail aloud in pain as she labor to give birth .        then another sign appear in the sky ; it be a huge red dragon ,    with seven head and ten horn , and on its head be seven diadem .        its tail sweep away a third of the star in the sky and hurl they down to the earth . then the dragon stand before the woman about to give birth , to devour her child when she give birth .        she give birth to a son , a male child , destine to rule all the nation with an iron rod .    her child be catch up to God and his throne .        the woman herself flee into the desert where she have a place prepare by God , that there she might be take care of for twelve hundred and sixty day .       then war break out in heaven ; Michael    and his angel battle against the dragon . the dragon and its angel fight back ,      but they do not prevail and there be no long any place for they in heaven .      the huge dragon , the ancient serpent ,    who be call the Devil and Satan , who deceive the whole world , be throw down to earth , and its angel be throw down with it .      then I hear a loud voice in heaven say : now have salvation and power come ,   and the kingdom of our God   and the authority of his anoint . for the accuser    of our brother be cast out ,   who accuse they before our God day and night .   they conquer he by the blood of the Lamb   and by the word of their testimony ;   love for life do not deter they from death .   therefore , rejoice , you heavens ,   and you who dwell in they . but woe to you , earth and sea ,   for the Devil have come down to you in great fury ,   for he know he have but a short time .     when the dragon see that it have be throw down to the earth , it pursue the woman who have give birth to the male child .        but the woman be give the two wing of the great eagle ,    so that she could fly to her place in the desert , where , far from the serpent , she be take care of for a year , two year , and a half - year .        the serpent ,    however , spew a torrent of water out of his mouth after the woman to sweep she away with the current .      but the earth help the woman and open its mouth and swallow the flood that the dragon spew out of its mouth .      then the dragon become angry with the woman and go off to wage war against the rest of her offspring , those who keep Gods commandment and bear witness to Jesus .         it take its position    on the sand of the sea .
