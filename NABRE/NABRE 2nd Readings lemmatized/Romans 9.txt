b ' V. Jews and Gentiles in Gods Plan    Pauls Love for Israel .      I speak the truth in Christ , I do not lie ; my conscience join with the holy Spirit in bear I witness        that I have great sorrow and constant anguish in my heart .      for I could wish that I myself be accurse and separate from Christ for the sake of my brother , my kin accord to the flesh .        they be Israelites ; theirs the adoption , the glory , the covenant , the giving of the law , the worship , and the promise ;        theirs the patriarch , and from they , accord to the flesh , be the Messiah . God who be over all    be bless forever . amen .     Gods Free Choice .     but it be not that the word of God have fail . for not all who be of Israel be Israel ,        nor be they all child of Abraham because they be his descendant ; but it be through Isaac that descendant shall bear your name .        this mean that it be not the child of the flesh who be the child of God , but the child of the promise be count as descendant .        for this be the wording of the promise , about this time I shall return and Sarah will have a son .        and not only that ,    but also when Rebecca have conceive child by one husband , our father Isaac   \xe2\x80\x94      before they have yet be bear or have do anything , good or bad , in order that Gods elective plan might continue ,      not by work but by his call\xe2\x80\x94she be tell , the old shall serve the young .        as it be write :   I love Jacob   but hate Esau .       what then be we to say ? be there injustice on the part of God ? of course not !        for he say to Moses : I will show mercy to whom I will ,   I will take pity on whom I will .      so it depend not upon a person will or exertion , but upon God , who show mercy .        for the scripture say to Pharaoh , this be why I have raise you up , to show my power through you that my name may be proclaim throughout the earth .        consequently , he have mercy upon whom he will ,    and he harden whom he will .       you will say to I then , why [ then ] do he still find fault ? for who can oppose his will ?        but who indeed be you , a human being , to talk back to God ?    will what be make say to its maker , why have you create I so ?      or do not the potter have a right over the clay , to make out of the same lump one vessel for a noble purpose and another for an ignoble one ?      what if God , wish to show his wrath and make know his power , have endure with much patience the vessel of wrath make for destruction ?        this be to make known the rich of his glory to the vessel of mercy , which he have prepare previously for glory ,      namely , we whom he have call , not only from the Jews but also from the Gentiles .    Witness of the Prophets .     as indeed he say in Hosea : those who be not my people I will call my people ,   and she who be not belove    I will call beloved .    and in the very place where it be say to they , you be not my people ,   there they shall be call child of the live God .       and Isaiah cry out concern Israel , though the number of the Israelites be like the sand of the sea , only a remnant will be save ;      for decisively and quickly will the Lord execute sentence upon the earth .      and as Isaiah predict : unless the Lord of host have leave we descendant ,   we would have become like Sodom   and have be make like Gomorrah .   Righteousness base on Faith .        what then shall we say ? that Gentiles , who do not pursue righteousness , have achieve it , that is , righteousness that come from faith ;        but that Israel , who pursue the law of righteousness , do not attain to that law ?        why not ? because they do it not by faith , but as if it could be do by work .    they stumble over the stone that cause stumble ,        as it be write : behold , I be lay a stone in Zion   that will make people stumble   and a rock that will make they fall , and whoever believe in he shall not be put to shame .
