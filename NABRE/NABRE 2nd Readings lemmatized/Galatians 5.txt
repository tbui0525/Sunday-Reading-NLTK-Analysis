b '    the Importance of Faith .      for freedom    Christ set we free ; so stand firm and do not submit again to the yoke of slavery .      it be I , Paul , who be tell you that if you have yourself circumcise , Christ will be of no benefit to you .        once again I declare to every man who have himself circumcise    that he be bind to observe the entire law .        you be separate from Christ , you who be try to be justify by law ; you have fall from grace .       for through the Spirit , by faith , we await the hope of righteousness .       for in Christ Jesus , neither circumcision nor uncircumcision count for anything , but only faith work through love .   be not mislead .        you be run well ;    who hinder you from follow [ the ] truth ?       that enticement do not come from the one who call you .        a little yeast leaven the whole batch of dough .        I be confident of you in the Lord that you will not take a different view , and that the one who be trouble you will bear the condemnation , whoever he may be .        as for I , brother , if I be still preach circumcision ,    why be I still be persecute ? in that case , the stumble block of the cross have be abolish .        would that those who be upset you might also castrate themselves !   Freedom for Service .        for you be call for freedom , brother .    but do not use this freedom as an opportunity for the flesh ; rather , serve    one another through love .      for the whole law    be fulfil in one statement , namely , you shall love your neighbor as yourself .        but if you go on bite and devour one another , beware that you be not consume by one another .      I say , then : live by the Spirit and you will certainly not gratify the desire of the flesh .        for the flesh have desire against the Spirit , and the Spirit against the flesh ; these be oppose to each other , so that you may not do what you want .        but if you be guide by the Spirit , you be not under the law .         now the work of the flesh be obvious : immorality , impurity , licentiousness ,        idolatry , sorcery , hatred , rivalry , jealousy , outburst of fury , act of selfishness , dissension , faction ,        occasion of envy ,    drinking bout , orgy , and the like . I warn you , as I warn you before , that those who do such thing will not inherit the kingdom of God .      in contrast , the fruit of the Spirit be love , joy , peace , patience , kindness , generosity , faithfulness ,        gentleness , self - control . against such there be no law .        now those who belong to Christ [ Jesus ] have crucify their flesh with its passion and desire .        if we live in the Spirit , let we also follow the Spirit .        let we not be conceited , provoke one another , envious of one another .
