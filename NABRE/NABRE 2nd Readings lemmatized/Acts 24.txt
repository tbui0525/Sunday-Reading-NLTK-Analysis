[   ]        if you examine he you will be able to learn from he for yourself about everything of which we be accuse he .      the Jews also join in the attack and assert that these thing be so .      then the governor motion to he to speak and Paul reply , I know that you have be a judge over this nation for many year and so I be pleased to make my defense before you .      as you can verify , not more than twelve day have pass since I go up to Jerusalem to worship .      neither in the temple , nor in the synagogue , nor anywhere in the city do they find I argue with anyone or instigate a riot among the people .      nor can they prove to you the accusation they be now make against I .      but this I do admit to you , that accord to the way , which they call a sect , I worship the God of our ancestor and I believe everything that be in accordance with the law and write in the prophet .        I have the same hope in God as they themselves have that there will be a resurrection of the righteous and the unrighteous .        because of this , I always strive to keep my conscience clear before God and man .        after many year , I come to bring alm for my nation and offering .        while I be so engaged , they find I , after my purification , in the temple without a crowd or disturbance .        but some Jews from the province of Asia , who should be here before you to make whatever accusation they might have against me\xe2\x80\x94      or let these man themselves state what crime they discover when I stand before the Sanhedrin ,      unless it be my one outcry as I stand among they , that I be on trial before you today for the resurrection of the dead .      then Felix , who be accurately inform about the way , postpone the trial , say , when Lysias the commander come down , I shall decide your case .      he give order to the centurion that he should be keep in custody but have some liberty , and that he should not prevent any of his friend from care for his need .    Captivity in Caesarea .      several day later Felix come with his wife Drusilla , who be jewish . he have Paul summon and listen to he speak about faith in Christ Jesus .      but as he speak about righteousness and self - restraint and the come judgment , Felix become frightened and say , you may go for now ; when I find an opportunity I shall summon you again .      at the same time he hope that a bribe would be offer he by Paul , and so he send for he very often and converse with he .     two year pass and Felix be succeed by Porcius Festus . wish to ingratiate himself with the Jews , Felix leave Paul in prison .
