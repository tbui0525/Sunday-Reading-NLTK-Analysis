b '    Jesus , Superior to Moses .      therefore , holy brother , share in a heavenly calling , reflect on Jesus , the apostle and high priest of our confession ,      who be faithful to the one who appoint he , just as Moses be faithful in [ all ] his house .        but he be worthy of more glory than Moses , as the founder of a house have more honor than the house itself .        every house be found by someone , but the founder of all be God .      Moses be faithful in all his house as a servant to testify to what would be speak ,        but Christ be faithful as a son place over his house . we be his house , if [ only ] we hold fast to our confidence and pride in our hope .    Israels Infidelity a warning .      therefore , as the holy Spirit say : oh , that today you would hear his voice ,     Harden not your heart as at the rebellion   in the day of testing in the desert ,    where your ancestor test and try I   and see my work        for forty year .   because of this I be provoke with that generation   and I say , they have always be of err heart ,   and they do not know my way .    as I swear in my wrath ,   they shall not enter into my rest .     take care , brother , that none of you may have an evil and unfaithful heart , so as to forsake the live God .      encourage yourselves daily while it be still today , so that none of you may grow harden by the deceit of sin .      we have become partner of Christ if only we hold the beginning of the reality firm until the end ,        for it be say : oh , that today you would hear his voice : Harden not your heart as at the rebellion .       who be those who rebel when they hear ? be it not all those who come out of Egypt under Moses ?      with whom be he provoke for forty year ? be it not those who have sin , whose corpse fall in the desert ?        and to whom do he swear that they should not enter into his rest , if not to those who be disobedient ?        and we see that they could not enter for lack of faith .
