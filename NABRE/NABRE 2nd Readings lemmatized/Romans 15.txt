b '   patience and self - denial .     we who be strong ought to put up with the failing of the weak and not to please ourselves ;        let each of we please our neighbor for the good , for build up .        for Christ do not please himself ; but , as it be write ,    the insult of those who insult you fall upon I .        for whatever be write previously be write for our instruction , that by endurance and by the encouragement of the scripture we might have hope .        may the God of endurance and encouragement grant you to think in harmony    with one another , in keep with Christ Jesus ,        that with one accord you may with one voice glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ . Gods Fidelity and Mercy .        welcome one another , then , as Christ welcome you , for the glory of God .        for I say that Christ become a minister of the circumcise to show Gods truthfulness , to confirm the promise to the patriarch ,        but so that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy . as it be write : therefore , I will praise you among the Gentiles   and sing praise to your name .      and again it say :   rejoice , o Gentiles , with his people .      and again : praise the Lord , all you Gentiles ,   and let all the people praise he .      and again Isaiah say : the root of Jesse shall come ,   raise up to rule the Gentiles ; in he shall the Gentiles hope .      may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing , so that you may abound in hope by the power of the holy Spirit .      Apostle to the Gentiles .      I myself be convinced about you , my brother , that you yourself be full of goodness ,    fill with all knowledge , and able to admonish one another .      but I have write to you rather boldly in some respect to remind you , because of the grace give I by God        to be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles in perform the priestly service of the gospel of God , so that the offering up of the Gentiles may be acceptable , sanctify by the holy Spirit .        in Christ Jesus , then , I have reason to boast in what pertain to God .      for I will not dare to speak of anything except what Christ have accomplish through I to lead the Gentiles to obedience by word and deed ,        by the power of sign and wonder , by the power of the Spirit [ of God ] , so that from Jerusalem all the way around to Illyricum    I have finish preach the gospel of Christ .      thus I aspire    to proclaim the gospel not where Christ have already be name , so that I do not build on another foundation ,        but as it be write :   those who have never be tell of he shall see ,   and those who have never hear of he shall understand .     Pauls Plans ; need for prayer .     that be why I have so often be prevent from come to you .      but now , since I no long have any opportunity in these region and since I have desire to come to you for many year ,        I hope to see you in pass as I go to Spain and to be send on my way there by you , after I have enjoy be with you for a time .         now , however , I be go to Jerusalem to minister to the holy one .        for Macedonia and Achaia    have decide to make some contribution for the poor among the holy one in Jerusalem ;        they decide to do it , and in fact they be indebted to they , for if the Gentiles have come to share in their spiritual blessing , they ought also to serve they in material blessing .        so when I have complete this and safely hand over this contribution to they , I shall set out by way of you to Spain ;      and I know that in come to you I shall come in the fullness of Christs blessing .     I urge you , [ brother , ] by our Lord Jesus Christ and by the love of the Spirit , to join I in the struggle by your prayer to God on my behalf ,        that I may be deliver from the disobedient in Judea , and that my ministry for Jerusalem may be acceptable to the holy one ,      so that I may come to you with joy by the will of God and be refresh together with you .      the God of peace be with all of you . amen .
