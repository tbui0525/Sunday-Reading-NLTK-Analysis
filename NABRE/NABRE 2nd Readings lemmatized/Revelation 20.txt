b '   the thousand - year Reign .      then I see an angel come down from heaven , hold in his hand the key to the abyss    and a heavy chain .        he seize the dragon , the ancient serpent , which be the Devil or Satan ,    and tie it up for a thousand year        and throw it into the abyss , which he lock over it and seal , so that it could no long lead the nation astray until the thousand year be complete . after this , it be to be release for a short time .     then I see throne ; those who sit on they be entrust with judgment . I also see the soul of those who have be behead for their witness to Jesus and for the word of God , and who have not worship the beast or its image nor have accept its mark    on their forehead or hand . they come to life and they reign with Christ for a thousand year .        the rest of the dead do not come to life until the thousand year be over . this be the first resurrection .      bless    and holy be the one who share in the first resurrection . the second death have no power over these ; they will be priest of God and of Christ , and they will reign with he for [ the ] thousand year .      when the thousand year be complete , Satan will be release from his prison .      he will go out to deceive the nation at the four corner of the earth , Gog and Magog ,    to gather they for battle ; their number be like the sand of the sea .        they invade the breadth of the earth    and surround the camp of the holy one and the beloved city . but fire come down from heaven and consume they .        the Devil who have lead they astray be throw into the pool of fire and sulfur , where the beast and the false prophet be . there they will be torment day and night forever and ever . the large white throne .        next I see a large white throne and the one who be sit on it . the earth and the sky flee from his presence and there be no place for they .        I see the dead , the great and the lowly , stand before the throne , and scroll be open . then another scroll be open , the book of life .    the dead be judge accord to their deed , by what be write in the scroll .        the sea give up its dead ; then Death and Hades    give up their dead . all the dead be judge accord to their deed .       then Death and Hades be throw into the pool of fire . ( this pool of fire be the second death .   )      anyone whose name be not find write in the book of life be throw into the pool of fire .             '
