b '    thus should one regard we : as servant of Christ and steward of the mystery of God .        now it be of course require of steward that they be find trustworthy .      it do not concern I in the least that I be judge by you or any human tribunal ; I do not even pass judgment on myself ;      I be not conscious of anything against I , but I do not thereby stand acquit ; the one who judge I be the Lord .        therefore , do not make any judgment before the appoint time , until the Lord come , for he will bring to light what be hide in darkness and will manifest the motive of our heart , and then everyone will receive praise from God . Pauls Life as pattern .        I have apply these thing to myself and Apollos for your benefit , brother , so that you may learn from we not to go beyond what be write ,    so that none of you will be inflate with pride in favor of one person over against another .      who confer distinction upon you ? what do you possess that you have not receive ? but if you have receive it , why be you boast as if you do not receive it ?      you be already satisfied ; you have already grow rich ; you have become king    without we ! indeed , I wish that you have become king , so that we also might become king with you .      for as I see it , God have exhibit we apostle as the last of all , like people sentence to death , since we have become a spectacle to the world , to angel and human being alike .        we be fool on Christs account , but you be wise in Christ ; we be weak , but you be strong ; you be hold in honor , but we in disrepute .        to this very hour we go hungry and thirsty , we be poorly clothe and roughly treat , we wander about homeless        and we toil , work with our own hand . when ridicule , we bless ; when persecute , we endure ;        when slander , we respond gently . we have become like the world rubbish , the scum of all , to this very moment .     I be write you this not to shame you , but to admonish you as my beloved child .        even if you should have countless guide to Christ , yet you do not have many father , for I become your father in Christ Jesus through the gospel .        therefore , I urge you , be imitator of I .        for this reason I be send you Timothy , who be my beloved and faithful son in the Lord ; he will remind you of my way in Christ [ Jesus ] , just as I teach they everywhere in every church .       some have become inflate with pride , as if I be not come to you .      but I will come to you soon , if the Lord be willing , and I shall ascertain not the talk of these inflated people but their power .      for the kingdom of God be not a matter of talk but of power .        which do you prefer ? shall I come to you with a rod , or with love and a gentle spirit ?
