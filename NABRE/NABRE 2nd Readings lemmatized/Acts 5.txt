b '   Ananias and Sapphira .      a man name Ananias , however , with his wife Sapphira , sell a piece of property .      he retain for himself , with his wife knowledge , some of the purchase price , take the remainder , and put it at the foot of the apostle .      but Peter say , Ananias , why have Satan fill your heart so that you lie to the holy Spirit and retain part of the price of the land ?        while it remain unsold , do it not remain yours ? and when it be sell , be it not still under your control ? why do you contrive this deed ? you have lie not to human being , but to God .      when Ananias hear these word , he fall down and breathe his last , and great fear come upon all who hear of it .      the young man come and wrap he up , then carry he out and bury he .     after an interval of about three hour , his wife come in , unaware of what have happen .      Peter say to she , tell I , do you sell the land for this amount ? she answer , yes , for that amount .      then Peter say to she , why do you agree to test the Spirit of the Lord ? listen , the footstep of those who have bury your husband be at the door , and they will carry you out .      at once , she fall down at his foot and breathe she last . when the young man enter they find she dead , so they carry she out and bury she beside her husband .      and great fear come upon the whole church and upon all who hear of these thing .   sign and Wonders of the Apostles .        many sign and wonder be do among the people at the hand of the apostle . they be all together in Solomons portico .        none of the other dare to join they , but the people esteem they .      yet more than ever , believer in the Lord , great number of man and woman , be add to they .      thus they even carry the sick out into the street and lay they on cot and mat so that when Peter come by , at least his shadow might fall on one or another of they .        a large number of people from the town in the vicinity of Jerusalem also gather , bring the sick and those disturb by unclean spirit , and they be all cure . trial before the Sanhedrin .        then the high priest rise up and all his companion , that is , the party of the Sadducees , and , fill with jealousy ,        lay hand upon the apostle and put they in the public jail .      but during the night , the angel of the Lord open the door of the prison , lead they out , and say ,        go and take your place in the temple area , and tell the people everything about this life .      when they hear this , they go to the temple early in the morning and teach . when the high priest and his companion arrive , they convene the Sanhedrin , the full senate of the Israelites , and send to the jail to have they bring in .      but the court officer who go do not find they in the prison , so they come back and report ,      we find the jail securely lock and the guard station outside the door , but when we open they , we find no one inside .      when they hear this report , the captain of the temple guard and the chief priest be at a loss about they , as to what this would come to .      then someone come in and report to they , the man whom you put in prison be in the temple area and be teach the people .      then the captain and the court officer go and bring they in , but without force , because they be afraid of be stone by the people .      when they have bring they in and make they stand before the Sanhedrin , the high priest question they ,      we give you strict order [ do we not ? ] to stop teach in that name . yet you have fill Jerusalem with your teaching and want to bring this man blood upon we .        but Peter and the apostle say in reply , we must obey God rather than man .         the God of our ancestor raise Jesus ,    though you have he kill by hang he on a tree .      God exalt he at his right hand    as leader and savior to grant Israel repentance and forgiveness of sin .        we be witness of these thing , as be the holy Spirit that God have give to those who obey he .      when they hear this , they become infuriated and want to put they to death .       but a Pharisee in the Sanhedrin name Gamaliel , a teacher of the law , respect by all the people , stand up , order the man to be put outside for a short time ,        and say to they , Fellow Israelites , be careful what you be about to do to these man .       some time ago , Theudas appear , claim to be someone important , and about four hundred man join he , but he be kill , and all those who be loyal to he be disband and come to nothing .      after he come Judas the Galilean at the time of the census . he also draw people after he , but he too perish and all who be loyal to he be scatter .      so now I tell you , have nothing to do with these man , and let they go . for if this endeavor or this activity be of human origin , it will destroy itself .      but if it come from God , you will not be able to destroy they ; you may even find yourself fight against God . they be persuade by he .      after recall the apostle , they have they flog , order they to stop speak in the name of Jesus , and dismiss they .        so they leave the presence of the Sanhedrin , rejoice that they have be find worthy to suffer dishonor for the sake of the name .        and all day long , both at the temple and in their home , they do not stop teach and proclaim the Messiah , Jesus .
