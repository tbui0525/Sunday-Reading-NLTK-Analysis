b '    General exhortation .     finally , brother , we earnestly ask and exhort you in the Lord Jesus that , as you receive from we how you should conduct yourself to please god\xe2\x80\x94and as you be conduct yourselves\xe2\x80\x94you do so even more .      for you know what instruction    we give you through the Lord Jesus . Holiness in Sexual Conduct .        this be the will of God , your holiness : that you refrain from immorality ,      that each of you know how to acquire a wife for himself in holiness and honor ,      not in lustful passion as do the Gentiles who do not know God ;        not to take advantage of or exploit a brother in this matter , for the Lord be an avenger in all these thing , as we tell you before and solemnly affirm .      for God do not call we to impurity but to holiness .      therefore , whoever disregard this , disregard not a human being but God , who [ also ] give his holy Spirit to you .     Mutual Charity .     on the subject of mutual charity you have no need for anyone to write you , for you yourself have be teach by God to love one another .        indeed , you do this for all the brother throughout Macedonia . nevertheless we urge you , brother , to progress even more ,        and to aspire to live a tranquil life , to mind your own affair , and to work with your [ own ] hand , as we instruct you ,      that you may conduct yourself properly toward outsider and not depend on anyone .    Hope for the Christian Dead .     we do not want you to be unaware , brother , about those who have fall asleep , so that you may not grieve like the rest , who have no hope .      for if we believe that Jesus die and rise , so too will God , through Jesus , bring with he those who have fall asleep .        indeed , we tell you this , on the word of the Lord , that we who be alive , who be leave until the coming of the Lord ,    will surely not precede those who have fall asleep .        for the Lord himself , with a word of command , with the voice of an archangel and with the trumpet of God , will come down from heaven , and the dead in Christ will rise first .        then we who be alive , who be leave , will be catch up together    with they in the cloud to meet the Lord in the air . thus we shall always be with the Lord .      therefore , console one another with these word .
