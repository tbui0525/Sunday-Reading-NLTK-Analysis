b'   Since many have undertaken to compile a narrative of the events that have been fulfilled among us,       just as those who were eyewitnesses from the beginning and ministers of the word have handed them down to us,       I too have decided, after investigating everything accurately anew, to write it down in an orderly sequence for you, most excellent Theophilus,     so that you may realize the certainty of the teachings you have received.   II. The Infancy Narrative  Announcement of the Birth of John.    In the days of Herod, King of Judea,   there was a priest named Zechariah of the priestly division of Abijah; his wife was from the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth.       Both were righteous in the eyes of God, observing all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blamelessly.     But they had no child,   because Elizabeth was barren and both were advanced in years.       Once when he was serving as priest in his divisions turn before God,     according to the practice of the priestly service, he was chosen by lot to enter the sanctuary of the Lord to burn incense.       Then, when the whole assembly of the people was praying outside at the hour of the incense offering,     the angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing at the right of the altar of incense.     Zechariah was troubled by what he saw, and fear came upon him.     But the angel said to him, Do not be afraid,   Zechariah, because your prayer has been heard. Your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you shall name him John.       And you will have joy and gladness, and many will rejoice at his birth,     for he will be great in the sight of [the] Lord. He will drink neither wine nor strong drink.   He will be filled with the holy Spirit even from his mothers womb,       and he will turn many of the children of Israel to the Lord their God.     He will go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah   to turn the hearts of fathers toward children and the disobedient to the understanding of the righteous, to prepare a people fit for the Lord.       Then Zechariah said to the angel, How shall I know this? For I am an old man, and my wife is advanced in years.     And the angel said to him in reply, I am Gabriel,   who stand before God. I was sent to speak to you and to announce to you this good news.       But now you will be speechless and unable to talk   until the day these things take place, because you did not believe my words, which will be fulfilled at their proper time.     Meanwhile the people were waiting for Zechariah and were amazed that he stayed so long in the sanctuary.     But when he came out, he was unable to speak to them, and they realized that he had seen a vision in the sanctuary. He was gesturing to them but remained mute.     Then, when his days of ministry were completed, he went home.     After this time his wife Elizabeth conceived, and she went into seclusion for five months, saying,     So has the Lord done for me at a time when he has seen fit to take away my disgrace before others.  Announcement of the Birth of Jesus.       In the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a town of Galilee called Nazareth,     to a virgin betrothed to a man named Joseph, of the house of David, and the virgins name was Mary.       And coming to her, he said, Hail, favored one! The Lord is with you.       But she was greatly troubled at what was said and pondered what sort of greeting this might be.     Then the angel said to her, Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God.      Behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall name him Jesus.      He will be great and will be called Son of the Most High,   and the Lord God will give him the throne of David his father,     and he will rule over the house of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom there will be no end.       But Mary said to the angel, How can this be, since I have no relations with a man?       And the angel said to her in reply, The holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. Therefore the child to be born will be called holy, the Son of God.       And behold, Elizabeth, your relative, has also conceived   a son in her old age, and this is the sixth month for her who was called barren;     for nothing will be impossible for God.       Mary said, Behold, I am the handmaid of the Lord. May it be done to me according to your word. Then the angel departed from her.   Mary Visits Elizabeth.    During those days Mary set out and traveled to the hill country in haste to a town of Judah,     where she entered the house of Zechariah and greeted Elizabeth.     When Elizabeth heard Marys greeting, the infant leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth, filled with the holy Spirit,       cried out in a loud voice and said, Most blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb.       And how does this happen to me, that the mother of my Lord   should come to me?     For at the moment the sound of your greeting reached my ears, the infant in my womb leaped for joy.     Blessed are you who believed   that what was spoken to you by the Lord would be fulfilled.    The Canticle of Mary.     And Mary said:  My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord;    my spirit rejoices in God my savior.   For he has looked upon his handmaids lowliness;  behold, from now on will all ages call me blessed.   The Mighty One has done great things for me,  and holy is his name.   His mercy is from age to age  to those who fear him.   He has shown might with his arm,  dispersed the arrogant of mind and heart.   He has thrown down the rulers from their thrones  but lifted up the lowly.   The hungry he has filled with good things;  the rich he has sent away empty.   He has helped Israel his servant,  remembering his mercy,   according to his promise to our fathers,  to Abraham and to his descendants forever.     Mary remained with her about three months and then returned to her home. The Birth of John.       When the time arrived for Elizabeth to have her child she gave birth to a son.     Her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had shown his great mercy toward her, and they rejoiced with her.        When they came on the eighth day to circumcise   the child, they were going to call him Zechariah after his father,     but his mother said in reply, No. He will be called John.       But they answered her, There is no one among your relatives who has this name.     So they made signs, asking his father what he wished him to be called.     He asked for a tablet and wrote, John is his name, and all were amazed.     Immediately his mouth was opened, his tongue freed, and he spoke blessing God.       Then fear came upon all their neighbors, and all these matters were discussed throughout the hill country of Judea.     All who heard these things took them to heart, saying, What, then, will this child be? For surely the hand of the Lord was with him.   The Canticle of Zechariah.    Then Zechariah his father, filled with the holy Spirit, prophesied, saying:     Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel,  for he has visited and brought redemption to his people.    He has raised up a horn for our salvation  within the house of David his servant,   even as he promised through the mouth of his holy prophets from of old:   salvation from our enemies and from the hand of all who hate us,   to show mercy to our fathers   and to be mindful of his holy covenant   and of the oath he swore to Abraham our father,   and to grant us that,     rescued from the hand of enemies, without fear we might worship him     in holiness and righteousness  before him all our days.   And you, child, will be called prophet of the Most High,  for you will go before the Lord   to prepare his ways,   to give his people knowledge of salvation  through the forgiveness of their sins,  because of the tender mercy of our God   by which the daybreak from on high   will visit us   to shine on those who sit in darkness and deaths shadow,  to guide our feet into the path of peace.    The child grew and became strong in spirit, and he was in the desert until the day of his manifestation to Israel.             '
