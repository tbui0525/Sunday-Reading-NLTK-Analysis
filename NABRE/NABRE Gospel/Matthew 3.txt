b'   The Preaching of John the Baptist.      In those days John the Baptist appeared, preaching in the desert of Judea       [and] saying, Repent,   for the kingdom of heaven is at hand!        It was of him that the prophet Isaiah   had spoken when he said: A voice of one crying out in the desert, Prepare the way of the Lord,  make straight his paths.      John wore clothing made of camels hair and had a leather belt around his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey.     At that time Jerusalem, all Judea, and the whole region around the Jordan were going out to him     and were being baptized by him in the Jordan River as they acknowledged their sins.

Jesus said to him in reply, Allow it now, for thus it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness. Then he allowed him.       After Jesus was baptized, he came up from the water and behold, the heavens were opened [for him], and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove [and] coming upon him.
