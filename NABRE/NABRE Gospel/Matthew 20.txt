b'  The Workers in the Vineyard.     The kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out at dawn to hire laborers for his vineyard.     After agreeing with them for the usual daily wage, he sent them into his vineyard.     Going out about nine oclock, he saw others standing idle in the marketplace,      and he said to them, You too go into my vineyard, and I will give you what is just.     So they went off. [And] he went out again around noon, and around three oclock, and did likewise.     Going out about five oclock, he found others standing around, and said to them, Why do you stand here idle all day?     They answered, Because no one has hired us. He said to them, You too go into my vineyard.       When it was evening the owner of the vineyard said to his foreman, Summon the laborers and give them their pay, beginning with the last and ending with the first.     When those who had started about five oclock came, each received the usual daily wage.     So when the first came, they thought that they would receive more, but each of them also got the usual wage.     And on receiving it they grumbled against the landowner,     saying, These last ones worked only one hour, and you have made them equal to us, who bore the days burden and the heat.     He said to one of them in reply, My friend, I am not cheating you.   Did you not agree with me for the usual daily wage?      Take what is yours and go. What if I wish to give this last one the same as you?     [Or] am I not free to do as I wish with my own money? Are you envious because I am generous?      Thus, the last will be first, and the first will be last. The Third Prediction of the Passion.        As Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the twelve [disciples] aside by themselves, and said to them on the way,     Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and the scribes, and they will condemn him to death,     and hand him over to the Gentiles to be mocked and scourged and crucified, and he will be raised on the third day. The Request of James and John.        Then the mother   of the sons of Zebedee approached him with her sons and did him homage, wishing to ask him for something.     He said to her, What do you wish? She answered him, Command that these two sons of mine sit, one at your right and the other at your left, in your kingdom.     Jesus said in reply, You do not know what you are asking.   Can you drink the cup that I am going to drink? They said to him, We can.     He replied, My cup you will indeed drink, but to sit at my right and at my left [, this] is not mine to give but is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father.      When the ten heard this, they became indignant at the two brothers.     But Jesus summoned them and said, You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and the great ones make their authority over them felt.     But it shall not be so among you. Rather, whoever wishes to be great among you shall be your servant;      whoever wishes to be first among you shall be your slave.      Just so, the Son of Man did not come to be served but to serve and to give his life as a ransom   for many. The Healing of Two Blind Men.        As they left Jericho, a great crowd followed him.      Two blind men were sitting by the roadside, and when they heard that Jesus was passing by, they cried out, [Lord,]   Son of David, have pity on us!     The crowd warned them to be silent, but they called out all the more, Lord, Son of David, have pity on us!     Jesus stopped and called them and said, What do you want me to do for you?     They answered him, Lord, let our eyes be opened.     Moved with pity, Jesus touched their eyes. Immediately they received their sight, and followed him.            '
