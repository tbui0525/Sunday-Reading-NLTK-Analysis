b'   When Jesus finished giving these commands to his twelve disciples,   he went away from that place to teach and to preach in their towns.    The Messengers from John the Baptist.      When John heard in prison   of the works of the Messiah, he sent his disciples to him      with this question, Are you the one who is to come, or should we look for another?     Jesus said to them in reply, Go and tell John what you hear and see:      the blind regain their sight, the lame walk, lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the poor have the good news proclaimed to them.       And blessed is the one who takes no offense at me. Jesus Testimony to John.       As they were going off, Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John, What did you go out to the desert to see? A reed swayed by the wind?       Then what did you go out to see? Someone dressed in fine clothing? Those who wear fine clothing are in royal palaces.     Then why did you go out? To see a prophet?   Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.     This is the one about whom it is written: Behold, I am sending my messenger ahead of you;  he will prepare your way before you.     Amen, I say to you, among those born of women there has been none greater than John the Baptist; yet the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.       From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven suffers violence,   and the violent are taking it by force.       All the prophets and the law   prophesied up to the time of John.     And if you are willing to accept it, he is Elijah, the one who is to come.       Whoever has ears ought to hear.     To what shall I compare this generation?   It is like children who sit in marketplaces and call to one another,     We played the flute for you, but you did not dance, we sang a dirge but you did not mourn.     For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they said, He is possessed by a demon.       The Son of Man came eating and drinking and they said, Look, he is a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners. But wisdom is vindicated by her works.    Reproaches to Unrepentant Towns.     Then he began to reproach the towns where most of his mighty deeds had been done, since they had not repented.     Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the mighty deeds done in your midst had been done in Tyre and Sidon,   they would long ago have repented in sackcloth and ashes.       But I tell you, it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you.      And as for you, Capernaum: Will you be exalted to heaven?   You will go down to the netherworld. For if the mighty deeds done in your midst had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day.     But I tell you, it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom on the day of judgment than for you.    The Praise of the Father.     At that time Jesus said in reply,   I give praise to you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, for although you have hidden these things from the wise and the learned you have revealed them to the childlike.     Yes, Father, such has been your gracious will.     All things have been handed over to me by my Father. No one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and anyone to whom the Son wishes to reveal him.    The Gentle Mastery of Christ.     Come to me, all you who labor and are burdened,   and I will give you rest.       Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am meek and humble of heart; and you will find rest for yourselves.     For my yoke is easy, and my burden light.            '
