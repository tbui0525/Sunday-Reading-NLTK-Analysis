b'  The Temptation of Jesus.      Then Jesus was led by the Spirit into the desert to be tempted by the devil.      He fasted for forty days and forty nights,   and afterwards he was hungry.     The tempter approached and said to him, If you are the Son of God, command that these stones become loaves of bread.      He said in reply, It is written:  One does not live by bread alone,  but by every word that comes forth from the mouth of God.     Then the devil took him to the holy city, and made him stand on the parapet of the temple,     and said to him, If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down. For it is written: He will command his angels concerning you  and with their hands they will support you, lest you dash your foot against a stone.     Jesus answered him, Again it is written, You shall not put the Lord, your God, to the test.       Then the devil took him up to a very high mountain, and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in their magnificence,     and he said to him, All these I shall give to you, if you will prostrate yourself and worship me.       At this, Jesus said to him, Get away, Satan! It is written: The Lord, your God, shall you worship  and him alone shall you serve.

From that time on, Jesus began to preach and say,   Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. The Call of the First Disciples.        As he was walking by the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon who is called Peter, and his brother Andrew, casting a net into the sea; they were fishermen.     He said to them, Come after me, and I will make you fishers of men.      At once they left their nets and followed him.     He walked along from there and saw two other brothers, James, the son of Zebedee, and his brother John. They were in a boat, with their father Zebedee, mending their nets. He called them,     and immediately they left their boat and their father and followed him. Ministering to a Great Multitude.       He went around all of Galilee, teaching in their synagogues,   proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom, and curing every disease and illness among the people.        His fame spread to all of Syria, and they brought to him all who were sick with various diseases and racked with pain, those who were possessed, lunatics, and paralytics, and he cured them.
