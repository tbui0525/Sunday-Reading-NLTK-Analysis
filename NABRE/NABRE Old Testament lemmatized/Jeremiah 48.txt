b '   against Moab .      concern Moab . thus say the   Lord   of host , the God of Israel : ah , Nebo ! it be ravage ;   Kiriathaim be disgrace , capture ; disgrace and overthrow be the stronghold :    Moabs glory be no more . in heshbon they plot evil against she :   come ! we will put an end to she as a nation . you , too , Madmen ,    shall be silence ;   you the sword stalk !   listen ! an outcry from Horonaim ,    ruin and great destruction !   Moab be crush !   their outcry be hear in Zoar .   up the ascent of Luhith   they go weep ; at the descent to Horonaim   they hear cry of anguish :   Flee , save your life !   be like a wild donkey in the wilderness !   because you trust in your work and your treasure ,   you also shall be capture . Chemosh    shall go into exile ,   his priest and prince with he .    the destroyer come upon every city ,   not a city escape ; ruin be the valley ,   waste the plateau\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord .   set up a tombstone for Moab ;   it will soon become a complete wasteland , its city turn into ruin   where no one dwell .   curse be they who do the   Lord s work carelessly ,   curse those who keep their sword from shed blood .    Moab have be rest from its youth ,   suspend above its dreg , never pour from flask to flask ,   never drive into exile . thus it retain its flavor ,   its bouquet be not lose .      be assure ! the day be coming\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord \xe2\x80\x94when I will send he wine - maker to decant the wine ; they shall empty its flask and smash its jar .      Chemosh shall disappoint Moab , just as the house of Israel be disappoint by Bethel , in which they trust .      how can you say , we be hero ,   mighty warrior ?   the one who ravage Moab and its city come up ,   the good of its youth go down to slaughter\xe2\x80\x94   oracle of the King , whose name be   Lord   of host .   Moabs ruin be near at hand ,   its disaster approach swiftly .   Mourn , all you neighbor ,   all you who know its name ! say : how the mighty scepter be break ,   the glorious staff !   come down from glory , sit on the parched ground ,   enthrone daughter Dibon ;   Moabs destroyer have fall upon you ,   have shatter your stronghold .    stand along the road , keep watch ,   enthrone Aroer ; ask the flee man , the escape woman :   ask they what have happen .    Moab be put to shame , destroy .   Wail and cry out , proclaim it at the Arnon :   Moab be destroy !      Judgment have come upon the plateau : on Holon , Jahzah , and Mephaath ,        on Dibon , Nebo , and Beth - diblathaim ,      on Kiriathaim , Beth - gamul , and Beth - meon ,      on Kerioth and on Bozrah : on all the city of the land of Moab , far and near .     the horn of Moab be cut off ,   its arm be broken\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord .     make he drunk because he set himself over against the   Lord ; let Moab swim in his vomit and become a laughingstock .      have Israel not be a laughingstock to you ? be he catch among thief that you wag your head whenever you speak of he ?      Abandon the city , take shelter in the crag ,   inhabitant of Moab . be like the dove that nest   in the wall of a gorge .   we have hear of the pride of Moab ,    pride beyond bound : his loftiness , his pride , his scorn ,   his insolent heart .   I myself know his arrogance\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord \xe2\x80\x94   liar in word , liar in deed .   and so I wail over Moab ,   over all Moab I cry ,   over the people of Kir - heres I moan .    More than for Jazer I weep for you ,   vine of Sibmah . your tendril trail down to the sea ,   as far as Jazer they stretch . upon your summer harvest and your vintage ,   the destroyer have fall .    Joy and gladness be take away   from the garden land , the land of Moab . I dry up the wine from the wine vat ,   the treader tread no more ,   the vintage shout be still .     the cry of Heshbon and Elealeh be hear as far as Jahaz ; they call from Zoar to Horonaim and to Eglath - shelishiyah ; even the water of Nimrim turn into a wasteland .        I will leave no one in Moab\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord \xe2\x80\x94to offer burn offering on the high place or to make sacrifice to their god .      hence my heart wail like a flute for Moab ; my heart wail like a flute for the people of Kir - heres : the wealth they accumulate have perish .        every head have be shave bald , every beard cut off ; every hand gash , and all their loin be drape in sackcloth .        on all the rooftop of Moab and in all its square there be mourn . I have shatter Moab like a pot that no one wants\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord .      how terrified they be , how they wail ! how Moab turn its back in shame ! Moab have become a laughingstock and a horror to all its neighbor !     for thus say the   Lord : look there ! like an eagle he swoop ,   spread his wing over Moab .    city be capture ,   stronghold seize : on that day the heart of Moabs warrior   become like the heart of a woman in labor .    Moab shall be wipe out , a people no more ,   because it set itself over against the   Lord .    Terror , pit , and trap be upon you ,   enthrone Moab\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord .    those flee the terror   fall into the pit ; those climb out of the pit   be catch in the trap ; ah , yes ! I will bring these thing upon Moab   in the year of their punishment\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord .   in Heshbons shadow the fugitive   stop short , exhausted ; for fire blaze up from Heshbon ,   and flame up from the house of Sihon : it consume the forehead of Moab ,   the scalp of the noisemaker .    Woe to you , Moab !   you be finish , people of Chemosh ! your son be take into exile ,   your daughter into captivity .   yet I will restore the fortune of Moab   in the day to come\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord .   thus far the judgment on Moab .
