b ' prayer for Rescue from Persecutors   a prayer of David . I hear ,   Lord , my plea for justice ;   pay heed to my cry ; listen to my prayer   from lip without guile .   from you let my vindication come ;   your eye see what be right .   you have test my heart ,   search it in the night .   you have try I by fire ,   but find no malice in I . my mouth have not transgress    as other often do . as your lip have instruct I ,   I have keep from the way of the lawless .   my step have keep to your path ;   my foot have not falter .     II   I call upon you ; answer I , o God .   turn your ear to I ; hear my speech .   show your wonderful mercy ,   you who deliver with your right arm   those who seek refuge from their foe .    keep I as the apple of your eye ;   hide I in the shadow of your wing    from the wicked who despoil I .   III my ravenous enemy press upon I ;      they close their heart ,   they fill their mouth with proud roaring .   their step even now encircle I ;   they watch closely , keep low to the ground ,   like lion eager for prey ,   like a young lion lurk in ambush .   rise , o   Lord , confront and cast they down ;   rescue my soul from the wicked .   slay they with your sword ;   with your hand ,   Lord , slay they ;   snatch they from the world in their prime . their belly be be fill with your friend ;   their child be satisfied too ,   for they share what be leave with their young .   I be just\xe2\x80\x94let I see your face ;   when I awake , let I be fill with your presence .              '
