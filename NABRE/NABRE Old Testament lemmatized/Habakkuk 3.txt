b '   Hymn about Gods Reign   Prayer of Habakkuk , the prophet . accord to Shigyonot .      o   Lord , I have hear your renown ,   and be in awe , O   Lord , of your work . in the course of year revive it ,    in the course of year make yourself know ;   in your wrath remember compassion !      God come from Teman ,    the Holy One from Mount Paran .   Selah    his glory cover the heaven ,   and his praise fill the earth ;    his splendor spread like the light . he raise his horn high ,    he rejoice on the day of his strength .   before he go pestilence ,   and plague    follow in his step .   he stand and shake the earth ;   he look and make the nation tremble . ancient mountain be shatter ,   the age - old hill bow low ,   age - old orbit    collapse .     the tent of Cushan tremble ,   the pavilion of the land of Midian .    be your anger against the river , o   Lord ?   your wrath against the river ,   your rage against the sea ,    that you mount your steed ,   your victorious chariot ?   you readie your bow ,   you fill your bowstring with arrow . Selah    you split the earth with river ;    at the sight of you the mountain writhe . the cloud pour down water ;   the deep roar loudly . the sun    forget to rise ,    the moon leave its lofty station ,   at the light of your fly arrow ,   at the gleam of your flash spear .     in wrath you march on the earth ,   in fury you trample the nation .   you come forth to save your people ,   to save your anoint one .   you crush the back of the wicked ,   you lay he bare , bottom to neck . Selah      you pierce his head with your shaft ;   his prince you scatter with your stormwind ,   as food for the poor in unknown place .   you trample the sea with your horse   amid the churning of the deep water .     I hear , and my body tremble ;   at the sound , my lip quiver . decay invade my bone ,   my leg tremble beneath I . I await the day of distress   that will come upon the people who attack we .     for though the fig tree do not blossom ,   and no fruit appear on the vine , though the yield of the olive fail   and the terrace produce no nourishment , though the flock disappear from the fold   and there be no herd in the stall ,   yet I will rejoice in the   Lord   and exult in my save God .   God , my Lord , be my strength ;   he make my foot swift as those of deer   and enable I to tread upon the height .    for the leader ; with stringed instrument .             '
