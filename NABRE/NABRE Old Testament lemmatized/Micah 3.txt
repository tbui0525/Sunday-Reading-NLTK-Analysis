b '      and I say : hear , you leader of Jacob ,   ruler of the house of Israel ! be it not your duty to know what be right ,    you who hate what be good , and love evil ? you who tear their skin from they ,   and their flesh from their bone ;    who eat the flesh of my people ,   flay their skin from they ,   and break their bone ; who chop they in piece like flesh in a kettle ,   like meat in a pot .   when they cry to the   Lord ,   he will not answer they ; he will hide his face from they at that time ,   because of the evil they have do .      thus say the   Lord   regard the prophet :   o you who lead my people astray , when your tooth have something to bite   you announce peace , but proclaim war against the one   who fail to put something in your mouth .    therefore you shall have night , not vision ,   darkness , not divination ; the sun shall go down upon the prophet ,   and the day shall be dark for they .    then the seer shall be put to shame ,   and the diviner confound ; they shall all cover their lip ,   because there be no answer from God .   but as for I , I be fill with power ,   with the spirit of the   Lord ,   with justice and with might ; to declare to Jacob his crime   and to Israel his sin .      hear this , you leader of the house of Jacob ,   you ruler of the house of Israel ! you who abhor justice ,   and pervert all that be right ;   who build up Zion with bloodshed ,   and Jerusalem with wickedness !   its leader render judgment for a bribe ,   the priest teach for pay ,   the prophet divine for money , while they rely on the   Lord , say ,   be not the   Lord   in the midst of we ?   no evil can come upon we !    therefore , because of you ,   Zion shall be plow like a field ,   and Jerusalem reduce to rubble , and the mount of the temple   to a forest ridge .
