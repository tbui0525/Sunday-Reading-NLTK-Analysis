b '    but now they hold I in derision   who be young than I ,   whose father I should have disdain   to rank with the dog of my flock .   such strength as they have mean nothing to I ;   their vigor have perish .   in want and emaciate hunger    they flee to the parched land :   to the desolate wasteland by night .   they pluck saltwort    and shrub ;   the root of the broom plant be their food .   they be banish from the community ,   with an outcry like that against a thief\xe2\x80\x94   to dwell on the slope of the wadie ,   in cave of sand and stone ;   among the bush they bray ;   under the nettle they huddle together .   irresponsible , of no account ,   they be drive out of the land .   yet now they sing of I in mockery ;   I have become a byword among they .    they abhor I , they stand aloof ,   they do not hesitate to spit in my face !    because he have loosen my bowstring and afflict I ,   they have throw off restraint in my presence .   on my right the young rabble rise up ;   they trip my foot ,   they build their approach for my ruin .   they tear up my path ,   they promote my ruin ,   no helper be there against they .   as through a wide breach they advance ;   amid the uproar they come on in wave ;    terror roll over I . my dignity be drive off like the wind ,   and my well - being vanish like a cloud .   and now my life ebb away from I ,   day of affliction have take hold of I .    at night he pierce my bone ,   my sinew have no rest .   with great difficulty I change my clothe ,   the collar of my tunic fit around my waist .   he have cast I into the mire ;   I have become like dust and ashe .   I cry to you , but you do not answer I ;    I stand , but you take no notice .   you have turn into my tormentor ,   and with your strong hand you attack I .   you raise I up and drive I before the wind ;   I be toss about by the tempest .   indeed I know that you will return I to death   to the house destine for everyone alive .    yet should not a hand be hold out   to help a wretched person in distress ?   do I not weep for the hardship of other ;   be not my soul grieve for the poor ?    yet when I look for good , evil come ;   when I expect light , darkness come .   my inward part seethe and will not be still ;   day of affliction have overtake I .   I go about in gloom , without the sun ;   I rise in the assembly and cry for help .   I have become a brother to jackal ,   a companion to ostrich .   my blacken skin fall away from I ;   my very frame be scorch by the heat .   my lyre be tune to mourning ,   and my reed pipe to sound of weeping .
