b '   Gods Eternity and Human Frailty   a prayer of Moses , the man of God . I Lord , you have be our refuge   through all generation .   before the mountain be bear ,   the earth and the world bring forth ,   from eternity to eternity you be God .    you turn humanity back into dust ,    say , Return , you child of Adam !    a thousand year in your eye   be merely a day go by ,   before a watch pass in the night ,     you wash they away ;   they sleep ,   and in the morning they sprout again like an herb .   in the morning it bloom only to pass away ;   in the evening it be wilt and withered .      II   truly we be consume by your anger ,   fill with terror by your wrath .   you have keep our fault before you ,   our hidden sin in the light of your face .    our life ebb away under your wrath ;    our year end like a sigh .   Seventy be the sum of our year ,   or eighty , if we be strong ; Most of they be toil and sorrow ;   they pass quickly , and we be go .   who comprehend the strength of your anger ?   your wrath match the fear it inspire .   teach we to count our day aright ,   that we may gain wisdom of heart .    III   Relent , o   Lord ! how long ?   have pity on your servant !   fill we at daybreak with your mercy ,    that all our day we may sing for joy .   make we glad as many day as you humble we ,   for as many year as we have see trouble .    show your deed to your servant ,   your glory to their child .   may the favor of the Lord our God be ours .    prosper the work of our hand !   prosper the work of our hand !
