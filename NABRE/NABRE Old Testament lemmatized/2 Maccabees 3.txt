b ' III . Heliodorus Attempt to profane the Temple    Heliodorus Arrival in Jerusalem .     while the holy city live in perfect peace and the law be strictly observe because of the piety of the high priest Onias    and his hatred of evil ,        the king themselves honor the place and glorify the temple with the most magnificent gift .      Thus Seleucus ,    king of Asia , defray from his own revenue all the expense necessary for the liturgy of sacrifice .     but a certain Simon , of the priestly clan of Bilgah ,    who have be appoint superintendent of the temple , have a quarrel with the high priest about the administration of the city market .        since he could not prevail against Onias , he go to Apollonius of Tarsus , who at that time be governor of Coelesyria and Phoenicia ,      and report to he that the treasury in Jerusalem be full of such untold rich that the sum total of the asset be past counting and that since they do not belong to the account of the sacrifice , it would be possible for they to fall under the authority of the king .     when Apollonius have an audience with the king , he inform he about the rich that have be report to he . the king choose his chief minister Heliodorus and send he with instruction to seize those rich .      so Heliodorus immediately set out on his journey , ostensibly to visit the city of Coelesyria and Phoenicia , but in reality to carry out the king purpose .     when he arrive in Jerusalem and have be graciously receive by the high priest of the city , he tell he about the information that have be give , and explain the reason for his presence , and he inquire if these thing be really true .      the high priest explain that there be deposit for widow and orphan ,        and some be the property of Hyrcanus , son of Tobias ,    a man who occupy a very high position . contrary to the misrepresentation of the impious Simon , the total amount only to four hundred talent of silver and two hundred of gold .      it be utterly unthinkable to defraud those who have place their trust in the sanctity of the place and in the sacred inviolability of a temple venerate all over the world .    Heliodorus Plan to Rob the Temple .     but Heliodorus , because of the order he have from the king , say that in any case this money must be confiscate for the royal treasury .      so on the day he have set he go in to take an inventory of the fund . there be no little anguish throughout the city .      priest prostrate themselves before the altar in their priestly robe , and call toward heaven for the one who have give the law about deposit to keep the deposit safe for those who have make they .        whoever see the appearance of the high priest be pierce to the heart , for the change complexion of his face reveal his mental anguish .      the terror and bodily tremble that have come over the man clearly show those who see he the pain that lodge in his heart .      People rush out of their house and crowd together make common supplication , because the place be in danger of be profane .      woman , gird with sackcloth below their breast , fill the street . young woman seclude indoors all run , some to the gate , some to the wall , other peer through the windows\xe2\x80\x94      all of they with hand raise toward heaven , make supplication .      it be pitiful to see the populace prostrate everywhere and the high priest full of dread and anguish .      while they be implore the almighty Lord to keep the deposit safe and secure for those who have place they in trust ,      Heliodorus go on with his plan .    God protect the Temple .     but just as Heliodorus be arrive at the treasury with his bodyguard , the Lord of spirit and all authority produce an apparition so great that those who have be bold enough to accompany Heliodorus be panic - stricken at Gods power and faint away in terror .      there appear to they a richly caparison horse , mount by a fearsome rider . charge furiously , the horse attack Heliodorus with its front hoof . the rider be see wear golden armor .      then two other young man , remarkably strong , strikingly handsome , and splendidly attired , appear before he . stand on each side of he , they flog he unceasingly , inflict innumerable blow .      suddenly he fall to the ground , envelop in great darkness . his man pick he up and lay he on a stretcher .      they carry away helpless the man who a moment before have enter that treasury under arm with a great retinue and his whole bodyguard . they clearly recognize the sovereign power of God .    the Restoration and Testimony of Heliodorus .     as Heliodorus lie speechless because of Gods action and deprive of any hope of recovery ,      the people praise the Lord who have marvelously glorify his own place ; and the temple , charge so shortly before with fear and commotion , be fill with joy and gladness , now that the almighty Lord have appear .      quickly some of the companion of Heliodorus beg Onias to call upon the most high to spare the life of one who be about to breathe his last .      the high priest , suspect that the king might think that Heliodorus have suffer some foul play at the hand of the Jews , offer a sacrifice for the mans recovery .      while the high priest be offer the sacrifice of atonement , the same young man dress in the same clothing again appear and stand before Heliodorus . be very grateful to the high priest Onias , they tell he . it be for his sake that the Lord have spare your life .      since you have be scourge by Heaven , proclaim to all Gods great power . when they have say this , they disappear .     after Heliodorus have offer a sacrifice to the Lord and make most solemn vow to the one who have spare his life , he bid Onias farewell , and return with his soldier to the king .      before all he give witness to the deed of the most high God that he have see with his own eye .      when the king ask Heliodorus what sort of person would be suitable to be send to Jerusalem next , he answer :      if you have an enemy or one who be plot against the government , send he there , and you will get he back with a flogging , if indeed he survive at all ; for there be certainly some divine power about the place .      the one whose dwelling be in heaven watch over that place and protect it , and strike down and destroy those who come to harm it .      this be how the matter concern Heliodorus and the preservation of the treasury turn out .
