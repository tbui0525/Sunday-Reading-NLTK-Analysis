b '     happy those whose mouth cause they no grief ,   those who be not sting by remorse for sin .    happy be those whose conscience do not reproach they ,   those who have not lose hope .    the Use of Wealth   Wealth be not appropriate for the mean - spirited ;    to miser , what use be gold ?   what they deny themselves they collect for someone else ,   and stranger will live sumptuously on their possession .    to whom will they be generous that be stingy with themselves   and do not enjoy what be their own ?   none be bad than those who be stingy with themselves ;   they punish their own avarice .   if ever they do good , it be by mistake ;   in the end they reveal their meanness .   Misers be evil people ,   they turn away and disregard other .   the greedy see their share as not enough ;   greedy injustice dry up the soul .   the eye of the miserly be rapacious for food ,   but there be none of it on their own table .      my son , if you have the mean , treat yourself well ,   and enjoy life as well you can .    remember that death do not delay ,   and you have not be tell the grave appoint time .   before you die , be good to your friend ;   give they a share in what you possess .    do not deprive yourself of good thing now   or let a choice portion escape you .   will you not leave your rich to other ,   and your earning to be divide by lot ?   give and take , treat yourself well ,   for in Sheol there be no joy to seek .   all flesh grow old like a garment ;   the age - old law be : everyone must die .    as with the leave grow on a luxuriant tree\xe2\x80\x94   one fall off and another sprouts\xe2\x80\x94 so with the generation of flesh and blood :   one die and another flourish .    all human deed surely perish ;   the work they do follow after they .    the Search for wisdom and her blessing    happy those who meditate on Wisdom ,   and fix their gaze on knowledge ;    who ponder her way in their heart ,   and understand her path ;   who pursue she like a scout ,   and watch at her entry way ;   who peep through her window ,   and listen at her door ;   who encamp near her house   and fasten their tent peg next to her wall ;   who pitch their tent beside she ,   and dwell in a good place ;     who build their nest in her leave ,   and lodge in her branch ;   who take refuge from the heat in her shade   and dwell in her home .
