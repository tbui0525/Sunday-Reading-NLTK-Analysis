I be the one they intend to kill , but they abuse my concubine and she die .       so I take my concubine and cut she up and send she through every part of the territory of Israel , because of the terrible thing they have do in Israel .      so now , all you Israelites , give your judgment and counsel in this matter .        all the people rise as one to say , none of we will leave for our tent or return to our home .      now as for Gibeah , this be what we will do : we will go up against it by lot ,      take from all the tribe of Israel ten man for every hundred , a hundred for every thousand , a thousand for every ten thousand , and procure supply for the soldier who will go to exact from Gibeah of Benjamin the full measure of the terrible thing it commit in Israel .     so all the man of Israel gather against the city , united as one .      the tribe of Israel send man throughout the tribe of Benjamin to say , what be this evil that have occur among you ?      now give up the man , the scoundrel who be in Gibeah , that we may put they to death and thus purge the evil from Israel . but the Benjaminites refuse to listen to their kindred , the Israelites .      instead , the Benjaminites assemble from their city at Gibeah , to march out to battle with the Israelites .      on that day the Benjaminites muster from their city twenty - six thousand swordsman , in addition to the inhabitant of Gibeah , who muster seven hundred pick man       who be leave - handed , every one of they able to sling a stone at a hair without miss .      the man of Israel , without Benjamin , muster four hundred thousand swordsman , all of they warrior .      they go up to Bethel and consult God . when the Israelites ask , who shall go up first for we to do battle with the Benjaminites ? the   Lord   say : Judah first .          the Israelites rise in the morning and encamp against Gibeah .
