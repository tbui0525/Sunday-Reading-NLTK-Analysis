b '   the two Women Invite Passersby to their banquet     Wisdom have build her house ,    she have set up her seven column ;   she have prepare her meat , mix her wine ,   yes , she have spread her table .   she have send out her maidservant ; she call    from the height out over the city :    let whoever be naive turn in here ;   to any who lack sense I say ,   come , eat of my food ,   and drink of the wine I have mix !   Forsake foolishness that you may live ;    advance in the way of understanding .    Miscellaneous Aphorisms   whoever correct the arrogant earn insult ;   and whoever reprove the wicked incur opprobrium .   do not reprove the arrogant , lest they hate you ;   reprove the wise , and they will love you .    instruct the wise , and they become still wise ;   teach the just , and they advance in learn .   the beginning of wisdom be fear of the   Lord ,   and knowledge of the Holy One be understand .    for by I your day will be multiply   and the year of your life increase .    if you be wise , wisdom be to your advantage ;   if you be arrogant , you alone shall bear it .
