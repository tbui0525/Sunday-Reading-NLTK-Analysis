b '    Sacredness of Blood .     the   Lord   say to Moses :      speak to Aaron and his son , as well as to all the Israelites , and tell they : this be what the   Lord   have command :       any Israelite who slaughter an ox or a sheep or a goat , whether in the camp or outside of it ,      without first bring it to the entrance of the tent of meeting to present it as an offering to the   Lord   in front of the   Lord s tabernacle , shall be judge guilty of bloodshed    \xe2\x80\x94that individual have shed blood , and shall be cut off    from the people .      this be so that such sacrifice as they use to offer in the open field the Israelites shall henceforth bring to the   Lord   at the entrance of the tent of meeting , to the priest , and sacrifice they there as communion sacrifice to the   Lord .        the priest will splash the blood on the altar of the   Lord   at the entrance of the tent of meeting and burn the fat for an odor pleasing to the   Lord .      no long shall they offer their sacrifice to the demon    with whom they prostitute themselves .    this shall be an everlasting statute for they and their descendant .     tell they , therefore : anyone , whether of the house of Israel or of the alien reside among they , who offer a burn offering or sacrifice      without bring it to the entrance of the tent of meeting to offer it to the   Lord , shall be cut off from the people .       as for anyone , whether of the house of Israel or of the alien reside among they , who consume any blood , I will set myself against that individual and will cut that person off from among the people ,      since the life of the flesh be in the blood ,    and I have give it to you to make atonement    on the altar for yourself , because it be the blood as life that make atonement .      that be why I have tell the Israelites : no one among you , not even a resident alien , may consume blood .     anyone hunting ,    whether of the Israelites or of the alien reside among they , who catch an animal or a bird that may be eat , shall pour out its blood and cover it with earth ,        since the life of all flesh be its blood . I have tell the Israelites : you shall not consume the blood of any flesh . since the life of all flesh be its blood , anyone who consume it shall be cut off .     everyone , whether a native or an alien , who eat of an animal that die of itself or be kill by a wild beast , shall wash his garment , bathe in water , and be unclean until evening , and then become clean .        if one do not wash his garment and bathe , that person shall bear the penalty .
