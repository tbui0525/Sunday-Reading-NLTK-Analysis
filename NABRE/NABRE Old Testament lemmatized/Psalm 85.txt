b ' prayer for Divine Favor   for the leader . a psalm of the Korahites .    I   you once favor ,   Lord , your land ,   restore the captive of Jacob .    you forgave the guilt of your people ,   pardon all their sin . Selah   you withdraw all your wrath ,   turn back from your burn anger .     II   restore we , God of our salvation ;   let go of your displeasure with we .    will you be angry with we forever ,   prolong your anger for all generation ?    certainly you will again restore our life ,   that your people may rejoice in you .   show we ,   Lord , your mercy ;   grant we your salvation .    III    I will listen for what God , the   Lord , have to say ;   surely he will speak of peace to his people and to his faithful .   may they not turn to foolishness !   near indeed be his salvation for those who fear he ;   glory will dwell in our land .    love and truth will meet ;   justice and peace will kiss .    Truth will spring from the earth ;   justice will look down from heaven .    yes , the   Lord   will grant his bounty ;   our land will yield its produce .    Justice will march before he ,   and make a way for his footstep .             '
