Gods Response   then the   Lord   answer I and say :   write down the vision ;    make it plain upon tablet ,   so that the one who read it may run .   for the vision be a witness for the appoint time ,   a testimony to the end ; it will not disappoint . if it delay , wait for it ,   it will surely come , it will not be late .   see , the rash have no integrity ;   but the just one who be righteous because of faith shall live .      saying against tyrant    indeed wealth be treacherous ;   a proud man do not succeed . he who open wide his throat like Sheol ,   and be insatiable as death , who gather to himself all the nation ,   and collect for himself all the peoples\xe2\x80\x94   shall not all these take up a taunt against he ,    and make a riddle about he , say :    ah ! you who store up what be not yours   \xe2\x80\x94how long can it last!\xe2\x80\x94   you who load yourself down with collateral .   will your debtor    not rise suddenly ?   will they not awake , those who make you tremble ?   you will become their spoil !   because you plunder many nation ,   the remain people shall plunder you ; because of the shedding of human blood ,   and violence do to the land ,   to the city and to all who live in it .     ah ! you who pursue evil gain for your household ,   set your nest on high   to escape the reach of misfortune !   you have devise shame for your household ,   cut off many people , forfeit your own life ;   for the stone in the wall shall cry out ,    and the beam in the frame shall answer it !     ah ! you who build a city by bloodshed ,   and who establish a town with injustice !    be this not from the   Lord   of host :   people toil    for what the flame consume ,   and nation grow weary for nothing !   but the earth shall be fill   with the knowledge of the   Lord s glory ,   just as the water cover the sea .      ah ! you who give your neighbor   the cup of your wrath to drink , and make they drunk ,   until their nakedness be see !    you be fill with shame instead of glory ;   drink , you too , and stagger ! the cup from the   Lord s right hand shall come around to you ,   and utter shame shall cover your glory .   for the violence do to Lebanon    shall cover you ,    and the destruction of the animal shall terrify you ; because of the shedding of human blood ,   and violence do to the land ,   to the city and to all who live in it .     of what use be the carve image ,    that its maker should carve it ? or the molten image , the lie oracle ,   that its very maker should trust in it ,   and make mute idol ?   ah ! you who say to wood , Awake !   to silent stone , Arise !   can any such thing give oracle ?   it be only overlaid with gold and silver ,   there be no breath in it at all .   but the   Lord   be in his holy temple ;   silence before he , all the earth !
