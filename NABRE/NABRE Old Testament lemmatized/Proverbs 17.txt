b '    well a dry crust with quiet   than a house full of feasting with strife .    a wise servant will rule over an unworthy son ,   and will share the inheritance of the child .    the crucible for silver , and the furnace for gold ,   but the tester of heart be the   Lord .   the evildoer give heed to wicked lip ,   the liar , to a mischievous tongue .   whoever mock the poor revile their maker ;   whoever rejoice in their misfortune will not go unpunished .    children child be the crown of the elderly ,   and the glory of child be their parentage .   fine word ill fit a fool ;   how much more lying lip , a noble !   a bribe seem a charm to its user ;   at every turn it bring success .    whoever overlook an offense foster friendship ,   but whoever gossip about it separate friend .    a single reprimand do more for a discerning person   than a hundred lash for a fool .    the wicked pursue only rebellion ,   and a merciless messenger be send against they .    face a bear rob of her cub ,   but never fool in their folly !    if you return evil for good ,   evil will not depart from your house .     the start of strife be like the opening of a dam ;   check a quarrel before it burst forth !   whoever acquit the wicked ,    whoever condemn the just\xe2\x80\x94   both be an abomination to the   Lord .   of what use be money in the hand of fool   when they have no heart to acquire wisdom ?    a friend be a friend at all time ,   and a brother be bear for the time of adversity .    those without sense give their hand in pledge ,   become surety for their neighbor .    those who love an offense love a fight ;    those who build their gate high    court disaster .   the perverse in heart come to no good ,   and the double - tongue fall into trouble .    whoever conceive a fool have grief ;   the father of a numskull have no joy .   a joyful heart be the health of the body ,   but a depressed spirit dry up the bone .    a guilty person take out a bribe from the pocket ,   thus pervert the course of justice .    on the countenance of a discerning person be wisdom ,    but the eye of a fool be on the end of the earth .    a foolish son be vexation to his father ,   and bitter sorrow to she who bear he .    it be wrong to fine an innocent person ,   but beyond reason to scourge noble .   those who spare their word be truly knowledgeable ,   and those who be discreet be intelligent .    even fool , keep silent , be consider wise ;   if they keep their lip close , intelligent .
