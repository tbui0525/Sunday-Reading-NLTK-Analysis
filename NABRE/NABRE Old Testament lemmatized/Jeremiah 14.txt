b '   the Great Drought .     the word of the   Lord   that come to Jeremiah concern the drought :      Judah mourns ,   her gate be lifeless ; they be bow to the ground ,   and the outcry of Jerusalem go up .    the noble send their servant for water ,   but when they come to the cistern they find no water   and return with empty jar .   confounded , despairing , they cover their head    because of the ruin soil ; because there be no rain in the land   the farmer be confound , they cover their head .    even the doe in the field desert her young   because there be no grass .   the wild donkey stand on the bare height ,   gasp for breath like jackal ; their eye grow dim ;   there be no grass .   even though our crime bear witness against we ,   act ,   Lord , for your name sake\xe2\x80\x94 even though our rebellion be many ,   and we have sin against you .    Hope of Israel ,   Lord ,   our savior in time of need ! why should you be a stranger in the land ,   like a traveler stop only for a night ?   why be you like someone bewilder ,   a champion who can not save ? you be in our midst ,   Lord ,   your name we bear :   do not forsake we !     thus say the   Lord   about this people : they so love to wander   that they can not restrain their foot . the   Lord   take no pleasure in they ;   now he remember their guilt ,   and will punish their sin .      then the   Lord   say to I : do not intercede for the well - being of this people .        if they fast , I will not listen to their supplication . if they sacrifice burn offering or grain offering , I will take no pleasure in they . rather , I will destroy they with the sword , famine , and plague .      ah ! Lord   God , I reply , it be the prophet who say to they , you shall not see the sword ; famine shall not befall you . indeed , I will give you last peace in this place .      these prophet utter lie in my name , the   Lord   say to I : I do not send they ; I give they no command , nor do I speak to they . they prophesy to you lie vision , foolish divination , deception from their own imagination .        therefore , thus say the   Lord : concern the prophet who prophesy in my name , though I do not send they , and who say , sword and famine shall not befall this land : by sword and famine shall these prophet meet their end .        the people to whom they prophesy shall be throw out into the street of Jerusalem because of famine and the sword . no one shall bury they , their wife , their son , or their daughter , for I will pour out upon they their own wickedness .        speak to they this word : let my eye stream with tear   night and day , without rest , over the great destruction which overwhelm   the virgin daughter of my people ,   over her incurable wound .    if I walk out into the field ,   look ! those slay by the sword ; if I enter the city ,   look ! victim of famine . both prophet and priest ply their trade   in a land they do not know .   have you really cast Judah off ?   be Zion loathsome to you ? why have you strike we a blow   that can not be heal ? we wait for peace , to no avail ;   for a time of healing , but terror come instead .    we recognize our wickedness ,   Lord ,   the guilt of our ancestor :   we have sin against you .    do not reject we , for your name sake ,   do not disgrace your glorious throne .   remember ! do not break your covenant with we .    among the idol of the nation be there any that give rain ?   or can the mere heaven send shower ? be it not you ,   Lord ,   our God , to whom we look ?   you alone do all these thing .
