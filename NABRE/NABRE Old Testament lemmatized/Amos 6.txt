b '   Third Woe   Woe to those who be complacent in Zion ,   secure on the mount of Samaria , leader of the first among nation ,   to whom the people of Israel turn .   Pass over to Calneh and see ,   go from there to Hamath the great ,   and down to Gath    of the Philistines . be you well than these kingdom ,   or be your territory great than theirs ?   you who would put off the day of disaster ,   yet hasten the time of violence !   those who lie on bed of ivory ,   and lounge upon their couch ; eat lamb take from the flock ,   and calf from the stall ;   who improvise to the music of the harp ,   compose on musical instrument like David ,   who drink wine from bowl ,   and anoint themselves with the good oil ,   but be not make ill by the collapse of Joseph ;   therefore , now they shall be the first to go into exile ,   and the carousing of those who lounge shall cease .     the Lord   God   have swear by his very self\xe2\x80\x94   an oracle of the   Lord , the God of host : I abhor the pride of Jacob ,   I hate his stronghold ,   and I will hand over the city with everything in it ;    should there remain ten people   in a single house , these shall die .   when a relative or one who prepare the body pick up the remain   to carry they out of the house , if he say to someone in the recess of the house ,   be anyone with you ? and the answer be , no one , then he shall say , Silence !   for no one must mention the name of the   Lord .     indeed , the   Lord   have give the command   to shatter the great house to bit ,   and reduce the small house to rubble .   can horse run over rock ,   or can one plow the sea with oxen ? yet you have turn justice into gall ,   and the fruit of righteousness into wormwood ,    you who rejoice in Lodebar ,   and say , have we not , by our own strength ,   seize Karnaim    for ourselves ?   look , I be raise up against you , house of Israel\xe2\x80\x94   oracle of the   Lord , the God of hosts\xe2\x80\x94 a nation    that shall oppress you   from Lebo - hamath even to the Wadi Arabah .
