b '   chapter 12 one Center of Worship .     these be the statute and ordinance which you must be careful to observe in the land which the   Lord , the God of your ancestor , have give you to possess , throughout the time you live on its soil .         destroy entirely all the place where the nation you be to dispossess serve their god , on the high mountain , on the hill , and under every green tree .        tear down their altar , smash their sacred pillar , burn up their asherah , and chop down the idol of their god , that you may destroy the very name of they from that place .     that be not how you be to act toward the   Lord , your God .      instead ,    you shall seek out the place which the   Lord , your God , choose out of all your tribe and designate as his dwelling to put his name there .     there you shall go ,      bring your burn offering and sacrifice , your tithe and personal contribution , your votive and voluntary offering , and the firstling of your herd and flock .        there , too , in the presence of the   Lord , your God , you and your family shall eat and rejoice in all your undertaking , in which the   Lord , your God , have bless you .      you shall not do as we be do here today , everyone do what be right in their own sight ,        since you have not yet reach your rest place , the heritage which the   Lord , your God , be give you .      but after you have cross the Jordan and dwell in the land which the   Lord , your God , be give you as a heritage , when he have give you rest from all your enemy round about and you live there in security ,          then to the place which the   Lord , your God , choose as the dwelling place for his name you shall bring all that I command you : your burn offering and sacrifice , your tithe and personal contribution , and every special offering you have vow to the   Lord .      you shall rejoice in the presence of the   Lord , your God , with your son and daughter , your male and female slave , as well as with the Levite within your gate , who have no hereditary portion with you .      be careful not to sacrifice your burn offering in any place you like ,      but offer they in the place which the   Lord   choose in one of your tribal territory ; there you shall do what I command you .    Profane and Sacred Slaughter .      however , in any of your community you may slaughter and eat meat freely , accord to the blessing that the   Lord , your God , have give you ; the unclean as well as the clean may eat it , as they do the gazelle or the deer .         only , you shall not eat of the blood , but must pour it out on the ground like water .        moreover , you may not , in your own community , partake of your tithe of grain or wine or oil , of the firstborn of your herd or flock , of any offering you have vow , of your voluntary offering , or of your personal contribution .      these you must eat in the presence of the   Lord , your God , in the place that the   Lord , your God , choose , along with your son and daughter , your male and female slave , and the Levite within your gate ; and there , in the presence of the   Lord , you shall rejoice in all your undertaking .      be careful , also , that you do not neglect the Levite as long as you live in your land .       after the   Lord , your God , have enlarge your territory , as he promise you ,    and you think , I will eat meat , as it be your desire to eat meat , you may eat it freely ;      and if the place where the   Lord , your God , choose to put his name be too far , you may slaughter in the manner I have command you any of your herd or flock that the   Lord   have give you , and eat it freely in your own community .      you may eat it as you would the gazelle or the deer : the unclean and the clean eat it together .       but make sure that you do not eat of the blood ; for blood be life ; you shall not eat that life with the flesh .      do not eat of the blood , therefore , but pour it out on the ground like water .      do not eat of it , that you and your child after you may prosper for do what be right in the sight of the   Lord .      however , any sacred gift or votive offering that you may have , you shall bring with you to the place which the   Lord   choose ,      and there you must sacrifice your burn offering , both the flesh and the blood , on the altar of the   Lord , your God ; of your other sacrifice the blood indeed must be pour out against the altar of the   Lord , your God ,    but their flesh you may eat .     be careful to heed all these word I command you today , that you and your descendant after you may forever prosper for do what be good and right in the sight of the   Lord , your God .     warn against abominable practice .      when the   Lord , your God , cut down from before you the nation you be go in to dispossess , and you have dispossess they and be settle in their land ,      be careful that you not be trap into follow they after they have be destroy before you . do not inquire regard their god , how do these nation serve their god , so I might do the same .      you shall not worship the   Lord , your God , that way , because they offer to their god every abomination that the   Lord   detest , even burn their son and daughter to their god .
