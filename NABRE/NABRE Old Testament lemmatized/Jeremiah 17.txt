b '   the sin of Judah and its punishment   the sin of Judah be write   with an iron stylus , engrave with a diamond point   upon the tablet of their heart ,   and the horn of their altar ,      when their child remember their altar and their asherah , beside the green tree , on the high hill ,      the peak in the country . your wealth and all your treasure   I give as plunder , as payment for all your sin   throughout your territory ,   you will relinquish your hold on your heritage   which I have give you . I will enslave you to your enemy   in a land you do not know : for a fire have break out from my anger ,   burn forever .     true wisdom    thus say the   Lord : Cursed be the man who trust in human being ,   who make flesh his strength ,   whose heart turn away from the   Lord .    he be like a barren bush in the wasteland   that enjoy no change of season , but stand in lava bed in the wilderness ,   a land , salty and uninhabited .   bless be those who trust in the   Lord ;   the   Lord   will be their trust .    they be like a tree plant beside the water   that stretch out its root to the stream : it do not fear heat when it come ,   its leave stay green ; in the year of drought it show no distress ,   but still produce fruit .    more tortuous than anything be the human heart ,   beyond remedy ; who can understand it ?   I , the   Lord , explore the mind   and test the heart , give to all accord to their way ,   accord to the fruit of their deed .    a partridge that brood but do not hatch   be those who acquire wealth unjustly : in midlife it will desert they ;   in the end they be only fool .     the Source of life   a throne of glory , exalt from the beginning ,   such be our holy place .    O Hope of Israel ,   Lord !   all who forsake you shall be put to shame ; the rebel shall be enrol in the netherworld ;   they have forsake the   Lord , source of living water .     prayer for Vengeance   heal I ,   Lord , that I may be heal ;   save I , that I may be save ,   for you be my praise .   see how they say to I ,   where be the word of the   Lord ?   let it come to pass !    yet I do not press you to send disaster ;   the day without remedy I have not desire . you know what pass my lip ;   it be present before you .   do not become a terror to I ,   you be my refuge in the day of disaster .    let my persecutor be confounded\xe2\x80\x94not I !   let they be terrified\xe2\x80\x94not I ! bring upon they the day of disaster ,   crush they with double destruction .     Observance of the Sabbath .     thus say the   Lord   to I : go , stand at the Gate of Benjamin ,    where the king of Judah enter and leave , and at the other gate of Jerusalem .        there say to they : hear the word of the   Lord , you king of Judah , and all Judah , and all you inhabitant of Jerusalem who enter these gate !      thus say the   Lord : as you love your life , take care not to carry burden on the sabbath , to bring they in through the gate of Jerusalem .        bring no burden from your home on the sabbath . do no work whatever , but keep holy the sabbath day , as I command your ancestor ,        though they do not listen or give ear , but stiffen their neck so they could not hear or take correction .        if you truly obey me\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord \xe2\x80\x94and carry no burden through the gate of this city on the sabbath , keep the sabbath day holy and abstain from all work on it ,        then , through the gate of this city , king who sit upon the throne of David will continue to enter , ride in their chariot or upon their horse , along with their prince , and the people of Judah , and the inhabitant of Jerusalem . this city will remain inhabited forever .        to it people will come from the city of Judah and the neighborhood of Jerusalem , from the land of Benjamin and from the Shephelah , from the hill country and the Negeb , to bring burn offering and sacrifice , grain offering , incense , and thank offering to the house of the   Lord .        but if you do not obey I and keep holy the sabbath day , if you carry burden and come through the gate of Jerusalem on the sabbath , I will set fire to its gates\xe2\x80\x94a fire never to be extinguished\xe2\x80\x94and it will consume the palace of Jerusalem .
