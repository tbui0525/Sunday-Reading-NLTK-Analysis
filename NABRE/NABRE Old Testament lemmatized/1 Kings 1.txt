b '   Davids Old Age .      when King David be old and advanced in year , though they cover he with blanket he could not get warm .      his servant therefore say to he , let a young virgin be seek to attend my lord the king ,    and to nurse he . if she sleep with you , my lord the king will be warm .      so they seek for a beautiful girl throughout the territory of Israel , and find Abishag the Shunamite . so they bring she to the king .      the girl be very beautiful indeed , and she nurse the king and take care of he . but the king do not have relation with she .    Adonijahs Ambition .     Adonijah , son of Haggith , boast , I shall be king ! and he provide himself with chariot , horse , and a retinue of fifty to go before he .        yet his father would never antagonize he by ask , why be you do this ? Adonijah be also very handsome , and next in age to Absalom by the same mother .      he consult with Joab , son of Zeruiah , and with Abiathar the priest , and they become Adonijahs supporter .      however , Zadok the priest , Benaiah , son of Jehoiada , Nathan the prophet , Shimei and Rei , and Davids warrior do not support Adonijah .     Adonijah slaughter sheep , oxen , and fatling at the stone Zoheleth near En - rogel    and invite all his brother , the king son , and all the royal official of Judah ;      but he do not invite Nathan the prophet , or Benaiah , or the warrior , or Solomon his brother .    Solomon proclaim King .     then Nathan say to Bathsheba , solomons mother : have you not hear that Adonijah , son of Haggith , have become king , and our lord David do not know ?      come now , let I advise you so that you may save your life and the life of your son Solomon .      go , visit King David , and say to he , do you not , my lord king , swear to your handmaid : your son Solomon shall be king after I ; it be he who shall sit upon my throne ? why , then , have Adonijah become king ?      and while you be still there speak to the king , I will come in after you and confirm your word .     so Bathsheba visit the king in his room . the king be very old , and Abishag the Shunamite be care for the king .        Bathsheba bow in homage to the king . the king say to she , what do you wish ?        she answer he : my lord , you swear to your servant by the   Lord , your God , Solomon your son will be king after I ; it be he who shall sit upon my throne .      but now Adonijah have become king , and you , my lord king , do not know it .        he have sacrifice bull , fatling , and sheep in great number ; he have invite all the king son , Abiathar the priest , and Joab , the commander of the army , but not your servant Solomon .       now , my lord king , all Israel be look to you to declare to they who be to sit upon the throne of my lord the king after he .      if this be not do , when my lord the king rest with his ancestor , I and my son Solomon will be consider criminal .     while she be still speak to the king , Nathan the prophet come in .      they tell the king , Nathan the prophet be here . he enter the king presence and do he homage , bow to the floor .      then Nathan say : my lord king , do you say , Adonijah shall be king after I and shall sit upon my throne ?      for today he go down and sacrifice bull , fatling , and sheep in great number ; he invite all the king son , the commander of the army , and Abiathar the priest , and even now they be eat and drink in his company and say , long live King Adonijah !      but I , your servant , he do not invite ; nor Zadok the priest , nor Benaiah , son of Jehoiada , nor your servant Solomon .      if this be do by order of my lord the king , you do not tell I , your servant , who be to sit upon the throne of my lord the king after he .     King David answer , call Bathsheba here . when she enter the king presence and stand before he ,      the king swear , as the   Lord   live , who have redeem my life from all distress ,      this very day I will fulfill the oath I swear to you by the   Lord , the God of Israel , your son Solomon shall be king after I and shall sit upon my throne in my place .      bow to the floor in homage to the king , Bathsheba say , may my lord , King David , live forever !     then King David say , call Zadok the priest , Nathan the prophet , and Benaiah , son of Jehoiada . when they have enter the king presence ,      he say to they : take with you the royal official . Mount my son Solomon upon my own mule and escort he down to Gihon .      there Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet shall anoint he king over Israel , and you shall blow the ram horn and cry , long live King Solomon !      when you come back up with he , he be to go in and sit upon my throne . it be he that shall be king in my place : he I designate ruler of Israel and of Judah .      Benaiah , son of Jehoiada , answer the king : so be it ! may the   Lord , the God of my lord the king , so decree !      as the   Lord   have be with my lord the king , so may he be with Solomon , and make his throne even great than that of my lord , King David !     so Zadok the priest , Nathan the prophet , Benaiah , son of Jehoiada , and the Cherethites and Pelethites    go down , and mount Solomon on King Davids mule , escort he to Gihon .      then Zadok the priest take the horn of oil from the tent and anoint Solomon . they blow the ram horn and all the people shout , long live King Solomon !      then all the people go up after he , play flute and rejoice so much the earth split with their shouting .    Adonijah submit to Solomon .     Adonijah and all the guest who be with he hear it , just as they end their banquet . when Joab hear the sound of the ram horn , he ask , why this uproar in the city ?      as he be speak , Jonathan , son of Abiathar the priest , arrive . Adonijah say , come , you be a man of worth and must bring good news .      Jonathan answer Adonijah , Hardly !    our lord , King David , have make Solomon king .      the king send with he Zadok the priest , Nathan the prophet , Benaiah , son of Jehoiada , and the Cherethites and Pelethites , and they mount he upon the king own mule .      Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint he king at Gihon , and they go up from there rejoice , so that the city be in an uproar . that be the noise you hear .      moreover , Solomon have take his seat on the royal throne ,      and moreover the king servant have come to pay their respect to our lord , King David , say , may your God make Solomons name more famous than your name , his throne great than your throne ! and the king in his bed do homage .      this be what the king say : bless be the   Lord , the God of Israel , who have this day provide one to sit upon my throne , so that I see it with my own eye .      all the guest of Adonijah get up tremble , and go each their way ,      but Adonijah , in fear of Solomon , get up and go to grasp the horn of the altar .      it be report to Solomon : Adonijah , in fear of King Solomon , be cling to the horn of the altar and say , let King Solomon first swear that he will not kill I , his servant , with the sword .      Solomon answer , if he prove worthy , not a hair of his shall fall to the ground . but if evil be find in he , he shall die .      King Solomon send to have he bring down from the altar , and he come and pay homage to King Solomon . Solomon then say to he , go to your house .             '
