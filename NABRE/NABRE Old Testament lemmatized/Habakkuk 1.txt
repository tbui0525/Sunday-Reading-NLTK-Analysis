b '    the oracle which Habakkuk the prophet receive in a vision .    Habakkuks First Complaint   how long , o   Lord , must I cry for help    and you do not listen ?   or cry out to you , Violence !   and you do not intervene ?   why do you let I see iniquity ?   why do you simply gaze at evil ? destruction and violence be before I ;    there be strife and discord .   this be why the law be numb    and justice never come , for the wicked surround the just ;    this be why justice come forth perverted .    Gods Response    look over the nation and see !   be utterly amazed ! for a work be be do in your day   that you would not believe , be it tell .    for now I be raise up the Chaldeans ,    that bitter and impulsive people , who march the breadth of the land   to take dwelling not their own .   they be terrifying and dreadful ;   their right and their exalted position be of their own making .   Swifter than leopard be their horse ,   and fast than desert wolf . their horse spring forward ;   they come from far away ;   they fly like an eagle hasten to devour .   all of they come for violence ,   their combine onslaught , a stormwind   to gather up captive like sand .   they scoff at king ,   ridicule prince ; they laugh at any fortress ,   heap up an earthen ramp , and conquer it .   then they sweep through like the wind and vanish\xe2\x80\x94   they make their own strength their god !     Habakkuks Second Complaint   be you not from of old , o   Lord ,   my holy God , immortal ?   Lord , you have appoint they for judgment ,    O Rock ,    you have set they in place to punish !   your eye be too pure to look upon wickedness ,   and the sight of evil you can not endure . why , then , do you gaze on the faithless in silence   while the wicked devour those more just than themselves ?   you have make mortal like the fish in the sea ,   like creep thing without a leader .   he    bring they all up with a hook ,   and haul they away with his net ; he gather they in his fishing net ,   and then rejoice and exult .   therefore he make sacrifice to his net ,    and burn incense to his fishing net ; for thank to they his portion be rich ,   and his meal lavish .   shall they , then , keep on draw his sword   to slaughter nation without mercy ?
