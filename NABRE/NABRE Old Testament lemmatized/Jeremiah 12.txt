b '    you would be in the right , o   Lord ,   if I should dispute with you ;   even so , I must lay out the case against you . why do the way of the wicked prosper ,   why do all the treacherous live in contentment ?    you plant they ; they have take root ,   they flourish and bear fruit as well . you be upon their lip ,   but far from their thought .    Lord , you know I , you see I ,   you have find that my heart be with you .   pick they out like sheep for the butcher ,   set they apart for the day of slaughter .    how long must the land mourn ,   the grass of the whole countryside wither ? because of the wickedness of those who dwell in it   beast and bird disappear ,   for they say , God do not care about our future .     if run against man have weary you ,   how will you race against horse ? and if you be safe only on a level stretch ,   what will you do in the jungle of the Jordan ?     your kindred and your father house , even they betray you ; they have recruit a force against you . do not believe they , even when they speak fair word to you .     the Lords Complaint   I have abandon my house ,   cast off my heritage ; the beloved of my soul I have deliver   into the hand of her foe .    my heritage have become for I   like a lion in the thicket ; she have raise her voice against I ,   therefore she have incur my hatred .    my heritage be a prey for hyena ,   be surround by vulture ; come , gather together , all you wild animal ,   come and eat !    many shepherd have ravage my vineyard ,   have trample down my heritage ; my delightful portion they have turn   into a desert waste .    they have make it a mournful waste ,   desolate before I , Desolate , the whole land ,   because no one take it to heart .   upon every height in the wilderness   marauder have appear . the   Lord   have a sword that consume   the land from end to end :   no peace for any living thing .    they have sow wheat and reap thorn ,   they have tire themselves out for no purpose ; they be shame by their harvest ,   the burn anger of the   Lord .    Judahs Neighbors .     thus say the   Lord , against all my evil neighbor    who plunder the heritage I give my people Israel as their own : see , I will uproot they from their land ; the house of Judah I will uproot in their midst .      but after uproot they , I will have compassion on they again and bring they back , each to their heritage , each to their land .        and if they truly learn my people custom of swear by my name , as the   Lord   live , just as they teach my people to swear by Baal , then they shall be build up in the midst of my people .        but if they do not obey , I will uproot and destroy that nation entirely\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord .
