b '   the second Journey to Egypt .      now the famine in the land grow severe .      so when they have use up all the grain they have bring from Egypt , their father say to they , go back and buy we a little more food .      but Judah reply : the man strictly warn we , you shall not see I unless your brother be with you .        if you be willing to let our brother go with we , we will go down to buy food for you .      but if you be not willing , we will not go down , because the man tell we , you shall not see I unless your brother be with you .        Israel demand , why do you bring this trouble on I by tell the man that you have another brother ?      they answer : the man keep ask about we and our family : be your father still live ? do you have another brother ? we answer he accordingly . how could we know that he would say , bring your brother down here ?     then Judah urge his father Israel : let the boy go with I , that we may be off and on our way if you and we and our child be to keep from starve to death .        I myself will serve as a guarantee for he . you can hold I responsible for he . if I fail to bring he back and set he before you , I will bear the blame before you forever .        have we not delay , we could have be there and back twice by now !     Israel their father then tell they : if it must be so , then do this : put some of the land good product in your baggage and take they down to the man as gift : some balm and honey , gum and resin , and pistachio and almond .        also take double the money along , for you must return the amount that be put back in the mouth of your bag ; it may have be a mistake .      take your brother , too , and be off on your way back to the man .      may God Almighty grant you mercy in the presence of the man , so that he may let your other brother go , as well as Benjamin . as for I , if I be to suffer bereavement , I shall suffer it .     so the man take those gift and double the money and Benjamin . they make their way down to Egypt and present themselves before Joseph .      when Joseph see they and Benjamin , he tell his steward , take the man into the house , and have an animal slaughter and prepare , for they be to dine with I at noon .      do as Joseph have order , the steward conduct the man to Josephs house .      but they become apprehensive when they be lead to his house . it must be , they think , on account of the money put back in our bag the first time , that we be take inside\xe2\x80\x94 in order to attack we and take our donkey and seize we as slave .      so they go up to Josephs steward and talk to he at the entrance of the house .      if you please , sir , they say , we come down here once before to buy food .        but when we arrive at a night encampment and open our bag , there be each mans money in the mouth of his bag\xe2\x80\x94our money in the full amount ! we have now bring it back .        we have bring other money to buy food . we do not know who put our money in our bag .      he reply , calm down ! do not fear ! your God and the God of your father must have put treasure in your bag for you . as for your money , I receive it . with that , he lead Simeon out to they .     the steward then bring the man inside Josephs house . he give they water to wash their foot , and give fodder to their donkey .      then they set out their gift to await Josephs arrival at noon , for they have hear that they be to dine there .      when Joseph come home , they present he with the gift they have bring inside , while they bow down before he to the ground .      after inquire how they be , he ask they , and how be your aged father , of whom you speak ? be he still alive ?        your servant our father be still alive and do well , they say , as they kneel and bow down .      then Joseph look up and see Benjamin , his brother , the son of his mother . he ask , be this your young brother , of whom you tell I ? then he say to he , may God be gracious to you , my son !        with that , Joseph hurry out , for he be so overcome with affection for his brother that he be on the verge of tear . so he go into a private room and weep there .     after wash his face , he reappear and , now having collect himself , give the order , serve the meal .      it be serve separately to he ,    to the brother , and to the Egyptians who partake of his board . Egyptians may not eat with Hebrews ; that be abhorrent to they .      when they be seat before he accord to their age , from the old to the young , they look at one another in amazement ;      and as portion be bring to they from Josephs table , Benjamins portion be five time as large as    anyone else . so they drink freely and make merry with he .
