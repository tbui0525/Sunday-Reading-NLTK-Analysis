b ' Thanksgiving to God who save from death I   I love the   Lord , who listen   to my voice in supplication ,   who turn an ear to I   on the day I call .   I be catch by the cord of death ;     the snare of Sheol have seize I ;   I feel agony and dread .   then I call on the name of the   Lord ,   O   Lord , save my life !    II   Gracious be the   Lord   and righteous ;   yes , our God be merciful .    the   Lord   protect the simple ;   I be helpless , but he save I .   Return , my soul , to your rest ;   the   Lord   have be very good to you .    for my soul have be free from death ,   my eye from tear , my foot from stumble .    I shall walk before the   Lord   in the land of the living .      III    I keep faith , even when I say ,   I be greatly afflict !    I say in my alarm ,   all man be liar !    how can I repay the   Lord   for all the great good do for I ?   I will raise the cup of salvation    and call on the name of the   Lord .   I will pay my vow to the   Lord   in the presence of all his people .    Dear in the eye of the   Lord   be the death of his devoted .    Lord , I be your servant ,   your servant , the child of your maidservant ;    you have loose my bond .   I will offer a sacrifice of praise   and call on the name of the   Lord .    I will pay my vow to the   Lord    in the presence of all his people ,   in the court of the house of the   Lord ,   in your midst , o Jerusalem . Hallelujah !             '
