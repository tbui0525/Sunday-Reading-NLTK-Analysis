b '   the Lord strengthen Judah and rescue Ephraim   ask the   Lord   for rain in the spring season ,    the   Lord   who bring storm cloud , and heavy rain ,    who give to everyone grain in the field .   for the teraphim    have speak nonsense ,    the diviner have see false vision ; deceitful dream they have tell ,   empty comfort they have offer . this be why they wander like sheep ,   wretched , for they have no shepherd .    my wrath be kindle against the shepherd ,    and I will punish the leader . for the   Lord   of host attend to the flock , the house of Judah ,   and will make they like a splendid horse in battle .   from they will come the tower ,   from they the tent peg ,   from they the bow of war ,   from they every officer .   together they will be like warrior ,   trample the mud of the street in battle . they will wage war because the   Lord   be with they ,   and will put the horseman to shame .   I will strengthen the house of Judah ,    the house of Joseph    I will save ; I will bring they back , because I have mercy on they ;   they will be as if I have never cast they off ,   for I be the   Lord   their God , and I will answer they .    then Ephraim will be like a hero ,   and their heart will be cheer as by wine .   their child will see and rejoice\xe2\x80\x94   their heart will exult in the   Lord .   I will whistle for they and gather they in ;   for I will redeem they   and they will be as numerous as before .    I sow they among the nation ,   yet in distant land they will remember I ;   they will bear their child and return .    I will bring they back from the land of Egypt ,   and gather they from Assyria . to the land of Gilead and to Lebanon I will bring they ,   until no room be find for they .   I will cross over to Egypt   and smite the wave of the sea ,   and all the depth of the Nile will dry up . the pride of Assyria will be cast down ,   and the scepter of Egypt disappear .   I will strengthen they in the   Lord ,    in whose name they will walk\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord .             '
