b ' the reversal of Zions Fortunes   a song of ascent . I when the   Lord   restore the captive of Zion ,    we think we be dream .   then our mouth be fill with laughter ;   our tongue sing for joy .   then it be say among the nation ,   the   Lord   have do great thing for they .   the   Lord   have do great thing for we ;   oh , how happy we be !   restore our captive ,   Lord ,   like the dry stream bed of the Negeb .     II   those who sow in tear   will reap with cry of joy .    those who go forth weep ,   carry sack of seed , will return with cry of joy ,   carry their bundle sheaf .             '
