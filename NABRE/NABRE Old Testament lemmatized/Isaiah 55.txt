b '   an invitation to Grace   all you who be thirsty ,    come to the water ! you who have no money ,   come , buy grain and eat ; come , buy grain without money ,   wine and milk without cost !    why spend your money for what be not bread ;   your wage for what do not satisfy ? only listen to I , and you shall eat well ,   you shall delight in rich fare .   pay attention and come to I ;   listen , that you may have life . I will make with you an everlasting covenant ,   the steadfast loyalty promise to David .    as I make he a witness to people ,   a leader and commander of people ,   so shall you summon a nation you know not ,   and a nation    that know you not shall run to you , because of the   Lord , your God ,   the Holy One of Israel , who have glorify you .       seek the   Lord   while he may be find ,   call upon he while he be near .   let the wicked forsake their way ,   and sinner their thought ; let they turn to the   Lord   to find mercy ;   to our God , who be generous in forgiving .   for my thought be not your thought ,   nor be your way my ways\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord .   for as the heaven be high than the earth ,   so be my way high than your way ,   my thought high than your thought .      yet just as from the heaven   the rain and snow come down and do not return there   till they have water the earth ,   make it fertile and fruitful , give seed to the one who sow   and bread to the one who eat ,   so shall my word be   that go forth from my mouth ; it shall not return to I empty ,   but shall do what please I ,   achieve the end for which I send it .     yes , in joy you shall go forth ,   in peace you shall be bring home ; Mountains and hill shall break out in song before you ,   all tree of the field shall clap their hand .   in place of the thornbush , the cypress shall grow ,   instead of nettle ,    the myrtle . this shall be to the   Lord s renown ,   as an everlasting sign that shall not fail .
