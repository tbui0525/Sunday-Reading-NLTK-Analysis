b '     be not life on earth a drudgery ,    its day like those of a hireling ?   like a slave who long for the shade ,   a hireling who wait for wage ,   so I have be assign month of futility ,   and troubled night have be count off for I .   when I lie down I say , when shall I arise ?   then the night drag on ;   I be fill with restlessness until the dawn .   my flesh be clothe with worm and scab ;    my skin crack and fester ;   my day be swift than a weaver shuttle ;   they come to an end without hope .   remember that my life be like the wind ;    my eye will not see happiness again .   the eye that now see I shall no more behold I ;   when your eye be on I , I shall be go .   as a cloud dissolve and vanishe ,    so whoever go down to Sheol shall not come up .   they shall not return home again ;   their place shall know they no more .   my own utterance I will not restrain ;   I will speak in the anguish of my spirit ;   I will complain in the bitterness of my soul .    be I the Sea , or the dragon ,   that you place a watch over I ?    when I say , my bed shall comfort I ,   my couch shall ease my complaint ,   then you frighten I with dream   and terrify I with vision ,   so that I should prefer strangulation   and death rather than my existence .    I waste away : I will not live forever ;    let I alone , for my day be but a breath .    what be human being , that you make much of they ,   or pay they any heed ?   you observe they every morning    and try they at every moment !   how long before you look away from I ,   and let I alone till I swallow my spit ?   if I sin , what do I do to you ,   o watcher of mortal ? why have you make I your target ?   why should I be a burden for you ?   why do you not pardon my offense ,   or take away my guilt ? for soon I shall lie down in the dust ;   and should you seek I I shall be go .
