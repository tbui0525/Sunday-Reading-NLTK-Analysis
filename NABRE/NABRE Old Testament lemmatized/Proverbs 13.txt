b '    a wise son love correction ,   but the scoffer heed no rebuke .    from the fruit of the mouth one enjoy good thing ,    but from the throat of the treacherous come violence .    those who guard their mouth preserve themselves ;    those who open wide their lip bring ruin .    the appetite of the sluggard crave but have nothing ,   but the appetite of the diligent be amply satisfied .   the just hate deceitful word ,   but the wicked be odious and disgraceful .   justice guard one who walk honestly ,   but sin lead the wicked astray .    one act rich but have nothing ;   another act poor but have great wealth .    Peoples rich serve as ransom for their life ,   but the poor do not even hear a threat .    the light of the just give joy ,   but the lamp    of the wicked go out .    the stupid sow discord by their insolence ,   but wisdom be with those who take counsel .   Wealth win quickly dwindle away ,   but gather little by little , it grow .    Hope defer make the heart sick ,   but a wish fulfil be a tree of life .    whoever despise the word must pay for it ,    but whoever revere the command will be reward .   the teaching of the wise be a fountain of life ,   turn one from the snare of death .   good sense bring favor ,   but the way of the faithless be their ruin .    the shrewd always act prudently   but the foolish parade folly .    a wicked messenger bring on disaster ,   but a trustworthy envoy be a healing remedy .   poverty and shame befall those who let go of discipline ,   but those who hold on to reproof receive honor .    desire fulfil delight the soul ,   but turn from evil be an abomination to fool .   walk with the wise and you become wise ,   but the companion of fool fare badly .    Misfortune pursue sinner ,   but the just shall be recompense with good .   the good leave an inheritance to their children child ,   but the wealth of the sinner be store up for the just .   the tillage of the poor yield abundant food ,   but possession be sweep away for lack of justice .    whoever spare the rod hate the child ,   but whoever love will apply discipline .    when the just eat , their hunger be appease ;   but the belly of the wicked suffer want .
