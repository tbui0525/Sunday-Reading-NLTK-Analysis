b '    the word of Lemuel , king of Massa ,    the instruction his mother teach he :     what be you do , my son !    what be you do , son of my womb ;   what be you do , son of my vow !   do not give your vigor to woman ,   or your strength    to those who ruin king .   it be not for king , Lemuel ,   not for king to drink wine ;   strong drink be not for prince ,   Lest in drinking they forget what have be decree ,   and violate the right of any who be in need .   give strong drink to anyone who be perish ,   and wine to the embittered ;   when they drink , they will forget their misery ,   and think no more of their trouble .   open your mouth in behalf of the mute ,   and for the right of the destitute ;   open your mouth , judge justly ,   defend the needy and the poor !    IX . poem on the Woman of Worth    who can find    a woman of worth ?    far beyond jewel be her value .   her husband trust her judgment ;   he do not lack income .   she bring he profit , not loss ,    all the day of her life .   she seek out wool and flax   and weave with skillful hand .   like a merchant fleet ,    she secure her provision from afar .   she rise while it be still night ,   and distribute food to her household ,   a portion to her maidservant .   she pick out a field and acquire it ;   from her earning she plant a vineyard .   she gird herself with strength ;   she exert her arm with vigor .    she enjoy the profit from her dealing ;   her lamp be never extinguish at night .    she put her hand to the distaff ,   and her finger ply the spindle .    she reach out her hand to the poor ,   and extend her arm to the needy .   she be not concerned for her household when it snows\xe2\x80\x94   all her charge be doubly clothe .   she make her own coverlet ;   fine linen and purple be her clothing .   her husband be prominent at the city gate   as he sit with the elder of the land .    she make garment and sell they ,   and stock the merchant with belt .   she be clothe with strength and dignity ,   and laugh at the day to come .    she open her mouth in wisdom ;   kindly instruction be on her tongue .   she watch over    the affair of her household ,   and do not eat the bread of idleness .   her child rise up and call she bless ;   her husband , too , praise she :   many be the woman of prove worth ,   but you have excel they all .   Charm be deceptive and beauty fleeting ;   the woman who fear the   Lord   be to be praise .    acclaim she for the work of her hand ,   and let she deed praise she at the city gate .             '
