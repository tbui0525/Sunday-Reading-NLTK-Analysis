b '    if you return , israel\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord \xe2\x80\x94   return to I . if you put your detestable thing out of my sight ,   and do not stray ,    and swear , as the   Lord   live ,    in truth , in judgment , and in justice , then the nation shall bless themselves in he   and in he glory .      for to the people of Judah and Jerusalem , thus say the   Lord : till your untilled ground ,   and do not sow among thorn .    be circumcise for the   Lord ,    remove the foreskin of your heart ,   people of Judah and inhabitant of Jerusalem ; or else my anger will break out like fire ,   and burn so that no one can quench it ,   because of your evil deed .     the Invasion from the North   proclaim it in Judah ,   in Jerusalem announce it ; blow the trumpet throughout the land ,   call out , fill the rank ! say , Assemble , let we march   to the fortified city .   raise the signal\xe2\x80\x94to Zion !   seek refuge ! do not stand there ! disaster I bring from the north ,   and great destruction .   up come the lion from its lair ,   the destroyer of nation have set out ,   have leave its place , to turn your land into a desolation ,   your city into an uninhabited waste .    so put on sackcloth ,   mourn and wail : the blaze anger of the   Lord   have not turn away from we .     in that day\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord \xe2\x80\x94 the king will lose heart , and the prince ;   the priest will be horrified ,   and the prophet stun .   ah ! Lord   God , they will say ,   you really do deceive    we when you say : you shall have peace ,   while the sword be at our very throat .    at that time it will be say   to this people and to Jerusalem , a scorching wind from the bare height come   through the wilderness toward my daughter , the people .   not to winnow , not to cleanse ,    a strong wind from there come at my bidding . now I too pronounce   sentence upon they .    see ! like storm cloud he advance ,   like a whirlwind , his chariot ; swifter than eagle , his horse :   Woe to we ! we be ruin .   cleanse your heart of evil , Jerusalem ,   that you may be save . how long will you entertain   wicked scheme ?   a voice proclaim it from Dan ,   announce wickedness from Mount Ephraim :   make this known to the nation ,   announce it against Jerusalem : besieger be come from the distant land ,   shout their war cry against the city of Judah .    like watcher in the field they surround she ,   for she have rebel against me\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord .    your conduct , your deed , have do this to you ;   how bitter be this evil of yours ,   how it reach to your very heart !    my body ! my body ! how I writhe !    the wall of my heart ! my heart beat wildly ,   I can not be still ; for I myself have hear the blast of the horn ,   the battle cry .   Ruin upon ruin be report ;   the whole land be lay waste . in an instant my tent be ravage ;   in a flash , my shelter .    how long must I see the signal ,   hear the blast of the horn !   my people be fool ,   they do not know I ; they be senseless child ,   without understanding ; they be wise at evil ,   but they do not know how to do good .    I look at the earth\xe2\x80\x94it be waste and void ;   at the heavens\xe2\x80\x94their light have go out !    I look at the mountains\xe2\x80\x94they be quake !   all the hill be crumble !   I looked\xe2\x80\x94there be no one ;   even the bird of the air have fly away !   I looked\xe2\x80\x94the garden land be a wilderness ,   with all its city destroy   before the   Lord , before his blaze anger .     for thus say the   Lord : the whole earth shall be waste ,   but I will not wholly destroy it .    because of this the earth shall mourn ,   the heavens above shall darken ; I have speak , I will not change my mind ,   I have decide , I will not turn back .    at the shout of rider and archer   each city take to flight ; they shrink into the thicket ,   they scale the rock : all the city be abandon ,   no one live in they .   you now who be doom , what be you do   dress in purple ,   bedeck yourself with gold , enlarge your eye with kohl ?   you beautify yourself in vain ! your lover reject you ,   they seek your life .   yes , I hear the cry , like that of a woman in labor ,   like the anguish of a mother bear her first child\xe2\x80\x94 the cry of daughter Zion gasp ,   as she stretch out her hand : ah , woe be I ! I sink exhausted   before my killer !              '
