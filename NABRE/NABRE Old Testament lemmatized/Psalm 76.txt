b ' God defend Zion   for the leader ; a psalm with stringed instrument . a song of Asaph .    I   Renowned in Judah be God ,    whose name be great in Israel .   on Salem    be Gods tent , his shelter on Zion .    there the flash arrow be shatter ,   shield , sword , and weapon of war .   Selah    II   terrible and awesome be you ,   strong than the ancient mountain .    Despoiled be the stouthearte ;   they sink into sleep ;   the hand of all the man of valor have fail .    at your roar , o God of Jacob ,   chariot and steed lie still .   you , terrible be you ;   who can stand before you and your great anger ?    from the heaven you pronounce sentence ;   the earth be terrify and reduce to silence ,   when you arise , o God , for judgment   to save the afflict of the land . Selah   surely the wrath of man will give you thank ;   the remnant of your furor will keep your feast .    III   make and keep vow to the   Lord   your God .    may all around he bring gift to the one to be fear ,   who check the spirit of prince ,   who be fearful to the king of earth .             '
