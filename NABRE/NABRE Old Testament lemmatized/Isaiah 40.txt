b ' a. the Lords Glory in Israels Liberation chapter 40 promise of Salvation    Comfort , give comfort to my people ,   say your God .   speak to the heart of Jerusalem , and proclaim to she   that her service    have end ,   that her guilt be expiate , that she have receive from the hand of the   Lord   double for all her sin .      a voice proclaim :   in the wilderness prepare the way of the   Lord !   make straight in the wasteland a highway for our God !    every valley shall be lift up ,   every mountain and hill make low ; the rugged land shall be a plain ,   the rough country , a broad valley .   then the glory of the   Lord   shall be reveal ,   and all flesh shall see it together ;   for the mouth of the   Lord   have speak .     a voice say , Proclaim !   I answer , what shall I proclaim ? all flesh be grass ,   and all their loyalty like the flower of the field .    the grass wither , the flower wilt ,   when the breath of the   Lord   blow upon it . yes , the people be grass !    the grass wither , the flower wilt ,   but the word of our God stand forever .     go up onto a high mountain ,   Zion , herald of good news !   cry out at the top of your voice ,   Jerusalem , herald of good news ! cry out , do not fear !   say to the city of Judah :   here be your God !   here come with power   the Lord   God ,   who rule by his strong arm ; here be his reward with he ,   his recompense before he .   like a shepherd he feed his flock ;   in his arm he gather the lamb , carry they in his bosom ,   lead the ewe with care .     Power of God and the Vanity of Idols   who have measure with his palm the water ,   mark off the heaven with a span ,   hold in his finger the dust of the earth ,   weigh the mountain in scale   and the hill in a balance ?    who have direct the spirit of the   Lord ,   or instruct he as his counselor ?    whom do he consult to gain knowledge ?   who teach he the path of judgment ,   or show he the way of understanding ?     see , the nation count as a drop in the bucket ,   as a wisp of cloud on the scale ;   the coastland weigh no more than a speck .    Lebanon would not suffice for fuel ,    nor its animal be enough for burn offering .   before he all the nation be as nought ,   as nothing and void he count they .     to whom can you liken God ?    with what likeness can you confront he ?   an idol ? an artisan cast it ,   the smith plate it with gold ,   fit it with silver chain .     be mulberry wood the offering ?   a skilled artisan pick out   a wood that will not rot ,   seek to set up for himself   an idol that will not totter .      do you not know ? have you not hear ?   be it not tell you from the beginning ?   have you not understand from the founding of the earth ?   the one who be enthrone above the vault of the earth ,   its inhabitant like grasshopper , who stretch out the heavens like a veil   and spread they out like a tent to dwell in ,    who bring prince to nought   and make the ruler of the earth as nothing .   scarcely be they plant , scarcely sow ,   scarcely their stem root in the earth , when he breathe upon they and they wither ,   and the stormwind carry they away like straw .     to whom can you liken I as an equal ?   say the Holy One .   lift up your eye on high   and see who create    these : he lead out their army and number they ,   call they all by name . by his great might and the strength of his power   not one of they be miss !    why , o Jacob , do you say ,    and declare , o Israel , my way be hide from the   Lord ,   and my right be disregard by my God ?   do you not know ?   have you not hear ? the   Lord   be God from of old ,   creator of the end of the earth . he do not faint or grow weary ,   and his knowledge be beyond scrutiny .   he give power to the faint ,   abundant strength to the weak .   though young man faint and grow weary ,   and youth stagger and fall ,   they that hope in the   Lord   will renew their strength ,   they will soar on eagle wing ; they will run and not grow weary ,   walk and not grow faint .
