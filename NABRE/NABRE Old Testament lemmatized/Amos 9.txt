b '   Fifth Vision : the destruction of the Sanctuary   I see the Lord stand beside the altar . and he say : strike the capital   so that the threshold shake !   break they off on the head of they all ! those who be leave I will slay with the sword . not one shall get away ,   no survivor shall escape .     though they dig down to Sheol ,   even from there my hand shall take they ; though they climb to the heavens ,   even from there I shall bring they down .    though they hide on the summit of Carmel ,   there too I will hunt they down and take they ; though they hide from my gaze at the bottom of the sea ,   there I will command the serpent    to bite they .    though they go into captivity before their enemy ,   there I will command the sword to slay they . I will fix my gaze upon they   for evil and not for good .     the Lord   God   of host , who melt the earth with his touch ,   so that all who dwell on it mourn , so that it will all rise up like the Nile ,   and subside like the river of Egypt ;    who have build his upper chamber in heaven ,   and establish his vault over the earth ; who summon the water of the sea   and pour they upon the surface of the earth\xe2\x80\x94   the   Lord   be his name .      be you not like the Ethiopians to I ,   o Israelites?\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord \xe2\x80\x94 do I not bring the Israelites from the land of Egypt   as I bring the Philistines from Caphtor   and the Arameans    from Kir ?   see , the eye of the Lord   God   be on this sinful kingdom ,   and I will destroy it from the face of the earth\xe2\x80\x94 but I will not destroy the house of Jacob completely\xe2\x80\x94   oracle of the   Lord .   for see , I have give the command   to sift the house of Israel among all the nation , as one sift with a sieve ,   let no pebble fall to the ground .   all sinner among my people shall die by the sword ,   those who say , disaster will not reach or overtake we .        on that day I will raise up   the fall hut of David ; I will wall up its breach ,   raise up its ruin ,   and rebuild it as in the day of old ,    that they may possess the remnant of Edom ,   and all nation claim in my name\xe2\x80\x94   oracle of the   Lord , the one who do this .   yes , day be coming\xe2\x80\x94   oracle of the   Lord \xe2\x80\x94 when the one who plow shall overtake the one who reap   and the vintager , the sower of the seed ; the mountain shall drip with the juice of grape ,   and all the hill shall run with it .    I will restore my people Israel ,   they shall rebuild and inhabit their ruin city , plant vineyard and drink    the wine ,   set out garden and eat the fruit .    I will plant they upon their own ground ;   never again shall they be pluck from the land I have give them\xe2\x80\x94   the   Lord , your God , have speak .             '
