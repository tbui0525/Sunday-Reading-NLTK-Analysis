b '    seven woman will take hold of one man    on that day , say : we will eat our own food   and wear our own clothing ; only let your name be give we ,   put an end to our disgrace !    Jerusalem Purified     on that day , the branch    of the   Lord   will be beauty and glory ,   and the fruit of the land will be honor and splendor   for the survivor of Israel .   everyone who remain in Zion ,   everyone leave in Jerusalem will be call holy :   everyone inscribe for life    in Jerusalem .    when the Lord wash away   the filth of the daughter of Zion , and purge jerusalems blood from her midst   with a blast of judgment , a searing blast ,    then will the   Lord   create ,   over the whole site of Mount Zion   and over her place of assembly , a smoking cloud by day   and a light of flame fire by night .    for over all , his glory will be shelter and protection :   shade from the parch heat of day ,   refuge and cover from storm and rain .
