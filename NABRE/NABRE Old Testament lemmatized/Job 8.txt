b '   Bildads First Speech .     Bildad the Shuhite answer and say :     how long will you utter such thing ?   the word from your mouth be a mighty wind !   do God pervert judgment ,    do the Almighty pervert justice ?   if your child have sin against he   and he have leave they in the grip of their guilt ,   still , if you yourself have recourse to God   and make supplication to the Almighty ,   should you be blameless and upright ,   surely now he will rouse himself for you   and restore your rightful home .   though your beginning be small ,   your future will flourish indeed .   Inquire of the former generation ,   pay attention to the experience of their ancestors\xe2\x80\x94    as we be but of yesterday and have no knowledge ,   because our day on earth be but a shadow\xe2\x80\x94    will they not teach you and tell you   and utter their word of understanding ?    can the papyrus grow up without mire ?   can the reed grass flourish without water ?   while it be yet green and uncut ,   it wither quick than any grass .   so be the end of everyone who forget God ,   and so shall the hope of the godless perish .   his confidence be but a gossamer thread ,   his trust be a spider house .   he shall lean upon his house , but it shall not stand ;   he shall cling to it , but it shall not endure .   he thrive in full sun ,   and over his garden his shoot go forth ;   about a heap of stone his root be entwine ;   among the rock he take hold .   yet if one tear he from his place ,   it will disown he : I have never see you !   there he lie rot beside the road ,   and out of the soil another sprout .   behold , God will not cast away the upright ;   neither will he take the hand of the wicked .   once more will he fill your mouth with laughter   and your lip with rejoicing .   those who hate you shall be clothe with shame ,   and the tent of the wicked shall be no more .
