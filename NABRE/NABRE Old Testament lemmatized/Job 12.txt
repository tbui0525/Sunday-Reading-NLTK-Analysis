b '   Jobs Third Reply .      then Job answer and say :     no doubt you be the people   with whom wisdom shall die !   but I have intelligence as well as you ;    I do not fall short of you ;   for who do not know such thing as these ?   I have become the sport of my neighbor :    the one whom God answer when he call upon he ,   the just , the perfect man , be a laughingstock ;    the undisturbed esteem my downfall a disgrace   such as await unsteady foot ;   yet the tent of robber be prosperous ,   and those who provoke God be secure ,   whom God have in his power .    but now ask the beast to teach you ,   the bird of the air to tell you ;   or speak to the earth to instruct you ,   and the fish of the sea to inform you .   which of all these do not know   that the hand of God have do this ?   in his hand be the soul of every living thing ,    and the life breath of all mortal flesh .   do not the ear judge word   as the mouth taste food ?    so with old age be wisdom ,    and with length of day understand .   with he be wisdom and might ;   his be counsel and understanding .   if he knock a thing down , there be no rebuilding ;    if he imprison , there be no release .   he hold back the water and there be drought ;    he send they forth and they overwhelm the land .   with he be strength and prudence ;   the mislead and the misleader be his .   he send counselor away barefoot ,   make fool of judge .   he loosen the belt of king ,   tie a waistcloth on their loin .    he send priest away barefoot ,   lead the powerful astray .   he silence the trusted adviser ,   take discretion from the elder .   he pour shame on noble ,    the waistband of the strong he loosen .   he uncover deep thing from the darkness ,   bring the gloom into the light .   he make nation great and destroy they ,   spread people abroad and abandon they .   he take understanding from the leader of the land ,   make they wander in a pathless desert .   they grope in the darkness without light ;   he make they wander like drunkard .
