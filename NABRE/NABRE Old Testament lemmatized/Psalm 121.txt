b ' the Lord my Guardian   a song of ascent . I raise my eye toward the mountain .    from whence shall come my help ?    my help come from the   Lord ,   the maker of heaven and earth .      he will not allow your foot to slip ;    or your guardian to sleep .   behold , the guardian of Israel   never slumber nor sleep .    the   Lord   be your guardian ;   the   Lord   be your shade   at your right hand .    by day the sun will not strike you ,   nor the moon by night .    the   Lord   will guard you from all evil ;   he will guard your soul .    the   Lord   will guard your come and go   both now and forever .
