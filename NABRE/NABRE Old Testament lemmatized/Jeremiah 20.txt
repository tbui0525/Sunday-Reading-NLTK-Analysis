b '    now the priest Pashhur ,    son of Immer , chief officer in the house of the   Lord ,    hear Jeremiah prophesy these thing .      so he strike the prophet and put he in the stock at the upper Gate of Benjamin in the house of the   Lord .        the next morning , after Pashhur have release Jeremiah from the stock , the prophet say to he :    instead of Pashhur , the   Lord   name you Terror on every side .        for thus say the   Lord : indeed , I will hand you over to terror , you and all your friend . your own eye shall see they fall by the sword of their enemy . all Judah I will hand over to the power of the king of Babylon ,    who shall take they captive to Babylon or strike they down with the sword .      all the wealth of this city , all its resource and its valuable , all the treasure of the king of Judah , I will hand over to their enemy , who will plunder it and carry it away to Babylon .        you , Pashhur , and all the member of your household shall go into exile . to Babylon you shall go ; there you shall die and be bury , you and all your friend , because you have prophesy lie to they .     Jeremiahs Interior Crisis   you seduce I ,     Lord , and I let myself be seduce ;   you be too strong for I , and you prevail . all day long I be an object of laughter ;   everyone mock I .   whenever I speak , I must cry out ,   violence and outrage I proclaim ; the word of the   Lord   have bring I   reproach and derision all day long .   I say I will not mention he ,   I will no long speak in his name . but then it be as if fire be burn in my heart ,   imprison in my bone ; I grow weary hold back ,   I can not !    yes , I hear the whispering of many :   Terror on every side !   Denounce ! let we denounce he ! all those who be my friend   be on the watch for any misstep of mine . perhaps he can be trick ; then we will prevail ,   and take our revenge on he .    but the   Lord   be with I , like a mighty champion :   my persecutor will stumble , they will not prevail . in their failure they will be put to utter shame ,   to lasting , unforgettable confusion .    Lord   of host , you test the just ,   you see mind and heart , let I see the vengeance you take on they ,   for to you I have entrust my cause .    sing to the   Lord ,   praise the   Lord , for he have rescue the life of the poor   from the power of the evildoer !      curse be the day    on which I be bear ! may the day my mother give I birth   never be bless !    curse be the one who bring the news   to my father , a child , a son , have be bear to you !   fill he with great joy .   let that man be like the city   which the   Lord   relentlessly overthrew ; let he hear war cry in the morning ,   battle alarm at noonday ,     because he do not kill I in the womb ! then my mother would have be my grave ,   her womb confine I forever .    why do I come forth from the womb ,   to see sorrow and pain ,   to end my day in shame ?
