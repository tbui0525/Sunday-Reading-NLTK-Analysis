b '    all this my eye have see ;   my ear have hear and perceive it .   what you know , I also know ;    I do not fall short of you .   but I would speak with the Almighty ;    I want to argue with God .   but you gloss over falsehood ,   you be worthless physician , every one of you !   oh , that you would be altogether silent ;   that for you would be wisdom !   hear now my argument   and listen to the accusation from my lip .   be it for God that you speak falsehood ?   be it for he that you utter deceit ?   be it for he that you show partiality ?   do you make accusation on behalf of God ?   will it be well when he shall search you out ?   can you deceive he as you do a mere human being ?   he will openly rebuke you   if in secret you show partiality .   surely his majesty will frighten you   and dread of he fall upon you .   your reminder be ashy maxim ,   your fabrication mound of clay .   be silent ! let I alone that I may speak ,   no matter what happen to I .   I will carry my flesh between my tooth ,   and take my life in my hand .    slay I though he might ,    I will wait for he ;    I will defend my conduct before he .   this shall be my salvation :   no impious man can come into his presence .   pay close attention to my speech ,   give my statement a hearing .   behold , I have prepare my case ,    I know that I be in the right .   if anyone can make a case against I ,   then I shall be silent and expire .   two thing only do not use against I ,    then from your presence I need not hide :   withdraw your hand far from I ,   do not let the terror of you frighten I .   then call I , and I will respond ;   or let I speak first , and answer I .   what be my fault and my sin ?   my misdeed , my sin make known to I !   why do you hide your face   and consider I your enemy ?     will you harass a wind - drive leaf   or pursue a withered straw ?   for you draw up bitter indictment against I ,   and punish in I the fault of my youth .   you put my foot in the stock ;   you watch all my path   and trace out all my footstep ,   though I wear out like a leather bottle ,   like a garment the moth have consume .
