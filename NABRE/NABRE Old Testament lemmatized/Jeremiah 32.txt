Jeremiah say , this word come to I from the   Lord :      Hanamel , son of your uncle Shallum , will come to you with the offer :    purchase my field in Anathoth , since you , as near relative , have the first right of purchase .        and , just as the   Lord   have say , my cousin Hanamel come to I in the court of the guard and say , please purchase my field in Anathoth , in the territory of Benjamin ; as near relative , you have the first right of possession\xe2\x80\x94purchase it for yourself . then I know this be the word of the   Lord .      so I buy the field in Anathoth from my cousin Hanamel , weigh out for he the silver , seventeen shekel of silver .     when I have write and seal the deed , call witness and weigh out the silver on the scale ,      I accept the deed of purchase , both the seal copy , contain title and condition , and the open copy .        I give this deed of purchase to Baruch , son of Neriah , son of Mahseiah , in the presence of my cousin Hanamel and the witness who have sign the deed of purchase and before all the Judahites sit around in the court of the guard .      in their presence I give Baruch this charge :      thus say the   Lord   of host , the God of Israel : take these deed of purchase , both the seal and the open deed , and put they in an earthenware jar ,    so they can last a long time .      for thus say the   Lord   of host , the God of Israel : they shall again purchase house and field and vineyard in this land .     after I have give the deed of purchase to Baruch , son of Neriah , I pray to the   Lord :      ah , my Lord   God ! you make the heavens and the earth with your great power and your outstretched arm ; nothing be too difficult for you .        you continue your kindness through a thousand generation ; but you repay the ancestor guilt upon their child who follow they . great and mighty God , whose name be   Lord   of host ,        great in counsel , mighty in deed , whose eye be fix on all the way of mortal , give to all accord to their way , accord to the fruit of their deed :        you perform sign and wonder in the land of Egypt and to this day , in Israel and among all people , you have make a name for yourself as on this day .        you bring your people Israel out of the land of Egypt with sign and wonder , with a strong hand and an outstretched arm , and great terror .      and you give they this land , as you have swear to their ancestor to give they , a land flow with milk and honey .        they go in and take possession of it , but they do not listen to your voice . they do not live by your law ; they do not do anything you command they to do . then you make all this evil fall upon they .        see , the siegework have arrive at this city to capture it ; the city be hand over to the Chaldeans who be attack it , with sword , starvation , and disease . what you threaten have happened\xe2\x80\x94you can see it for yourself .        yet you tell I , my Lord   God : purchase the field with silver and summon witness , when the city have already be hand over to the Chaldeans !     then this word of the   Lord   come to Jeremiah :      I be the   Lord , the God of all the living ! be anything too difficult for I ?      therefore the   Lord   say : I be hand over this city to the Chaldeans and to Nebuchadnezzar , king of Babylon , and he shall capture it .      the Chaldeans who be attack this city shall go in and set the city on fire , burn it and the house , on whose roof incense be burn to Baal and libation be pour out to other god in order to provoke I .        from their youth the Israelites and the Judahites have be do only what be evil in my eye ; the Israelites have be provoke I with the work of their hands\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord .        this city have so stir my anger and wrath , from the day it be build to this day , that I must put it out of my sight ,      for all the evil the Israelites and Judahites have do to provoke me\xe2\x80\x94they , their king , their prince , their priest , and their prophet , the people of Judah and the inhabitant of Jerusalem .        they turn their back to I , not their face ; though I teach they persistently , they would not listen or accept correction .        instead they set up their abomination in the house which bear my name in order to defile it .        they build high place to Baal in the Valley of Ben - hinnom to sacrifice their son and daughter to Molech ;    I never command they to do this , nor do it even enter my mind that they would practice this abomination , so as to bring sin upon Judah .      now , therefore , thus say the   Lord , the God of Israel , concern this city , which you say be be hand over to the king of Babylon by mean of the sword , starvation , and disease :      see , I be gather they from all the land to which I drive they in my rise fury and great anger ; I will bring they back to this place and settle they here in safety .        they shall be my people , and I will be their God .        I will give they one heart and one way , that they may fear I always , for their own good and the good of their child after they .      with they I will make an everlasting covenant , never to cease do good to they ; I will put fear of I in their heart so that they never turn away from I .        I will take delight in do good to they : I will plant they firmly in this land , with all my heart and soul .      for thus say the   Lord : just as I have bring upon this people all this great evil , so I will bring upon they all the good I have promise they .        Fields shall be purchase in this land , about which you say , it be a wasteland , without human being or animal , hand over to the Chaldeans .        they will purchase field with silver , write up deed , seal they , and have they witness in the land of Benjamin , in the neighborhood of Jerusalem , in the city of Judah and of the hill country , in the city of the Shephelah and the Negeb , when I restore their fortunes\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord .
