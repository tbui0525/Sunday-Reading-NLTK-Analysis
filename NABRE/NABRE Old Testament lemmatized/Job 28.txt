b '    where be wisdom to be find ?   there be indeed a mine for silver ,    and a place for refine gold .   Iron be take from the earth ,   and copper smelt out of stone .    he set a boundary for the darkness ;   the farth confine he explore .   he break open a shaft far from habitation ,   unknown to human foot ;   suspend , far from people , they sway .   the earth , though out of it come forth bread ,   be in fiery upheaval underneath .   its stone be the source of lapis lazuli ,   and there be gold in its dust .   the path no bird of prey know ,   nor have the hawks eye see it .   the proud beast have not trodden it ,   nor have the lion go that way .   he set his hand to the flinty rock ,   and overturn the mountain at their root .   he split channel in the rock ;   his eye behold all that be precious .   he dam up the source of the stream ,   and bring hidden thing to light .   as for wisdom\xe2\x80\x94where can she be find ?   where be the place of understanding ?    mortal do not know her path ,   nor be she to be find in the land of the living .   the Deep say , she be not in I ;   and the Sea say , she be not with I .   solid gold can not purchase she ,   nor can her price be pay with silver .    she can not be buy with gold of Ophir ,    with precious onyx or lapis lazuli ,   Gold or crystal can not equal she ,   nor can golden vessel be exchange for she .   neither coral nor crystal should be think of ;   the value of wisdom surpass pearl .   ethiopian topaz do not equal she ,   nor can she be weigh out for pure gold .   as for wisdom , where do she come from ?   where be the place of understanding ?   she be hide from the eye of every living thing ;   even from the bird of the air she be conceal .   Abaddon    and Death say ,   only by rumor have we hear of she .    but God understand the way to she ;    it be he who know her place .    for he behold the end of the earth   and see all that be under the heaven .   when he weigh out the wind ,   and measure out the water ;   when he make a rule for the rain   and a path for the thunderbolt ,    then he see wisdom and appraise she ,   establish she , and search she out .    and to mortal he say :   see : the fear of the Lord be wisdom ;   and avoid evil be understand .
