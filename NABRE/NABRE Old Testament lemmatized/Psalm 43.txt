b '    Grant me justice , o God ;   defend I from a faithless people ;   from the deceitful and unjust rescue I .    you , o God , be my strength .   why then do you spurn I ? why must I go about mourning ,   with the enemy oppress I ?    send your light and your fidelity ,    that they may be my guide ;   let they bring I to your holy mountain ,   to the place of your dwelling ,   that I may come to the altar of God ,   to God , my joy , my delight . then I will praise you with the harp ,   o God , my God .   why be you downcast , my soul ?   why do you groan within I ? wait for God , for I shall again praise he ,   my savior and my God .
