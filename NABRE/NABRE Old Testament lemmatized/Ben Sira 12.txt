b '    if you do good , know for whom you be do it ,    and your kindness will have its effect .   do good to the righteous and reward will be yours ,   if not from they , from the   Lord .    no good come to those who give comfort to the wicked ,   nor be it an act of mercy that they do .   give to the good but refuse the sinner ;    refresh the downtrodden but give nothing to the proud . no arm for combat should you give they ,   lest they use these against you ; Twofold evil you will obtain for every good deed you do for they .   for God also hate sinner ,   and take vengeance on evildoer .      in prosperity we can not know our friend ;    in adversity an enemy will not remain conceal .    when one be successful even an enemy be friendly ;   but in adversity even a friend disappear .    never trust your enemy ,   for their wickedness be like corrosion in bronze .   even though they act deferentially and peaceably toward you ,   take care to be on your guard against they .   treat they as those who reveal secret ,    and be certain that in the end there will still be envy .   do not let they stand near you ,   lest they push you aside and take your place . do not let they sit at your right hand ,   or they will demand your seat , and in the end you will appreciate my advice ,   when you groan with regret , as I warn .     who pity a snake charmer when he be bite ,    or anyone who go near a wild beast ?   so it be with the companion of the proud ,   who be involve in their sin :   while you stand firm , they make no move ;   but if you slip , they can not hold back .   with their lip enemy speak sweetly ,   but in their heart they scheme to plunge you into the abyss . though enemy have tear in their eye ,   give the chance , they will never have enough of your blood .    if evil come upon you , you will find they at hand ;   pretend to help , they will trip you up ,   then they will shake their head and clap their hand   and hiss repeatedly , and show their true face .
