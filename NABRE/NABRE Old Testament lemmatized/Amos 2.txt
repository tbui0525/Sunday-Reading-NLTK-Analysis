b '   Moab   thus say the   Lord : for three crime of Moab , and now four\xe2\x80\x94   I will not take it back\xe2\x80\x94 because he burn to ashe    the bone of Edoms king ,   I will send fire upon Moab ,   and it will devour the stronghold of Kerioth ; Moab shall meet death amid uproar ,   battle cry and blast of the ram horn .   I will cut off the ruler from its midst ,   and all the prince I will slay with he , say the   Lord .    Judah    thus say the   Lord : for three crime of Judah , and now four\xe2\x80\x94   I will not take it back\xe2\x80\x94 because they spurn the instruction of the   Lord ,    and do not keep his statute ; because the lie    which their ancestor follow   have lead they astray ,   I will send fire upon Judah ,   and it will devour the stronghold of Jerusalem .    Israel   thus say the   Lord : for three crime of Israel ,    and now four\xe2\x80\x94   I will not take it back\xe2\x80\x94 because they hand over the just for silver ,   and the poor for a pair of sandal ;    they trample the head of the destitute   into the dust of the earth ,   and force the lowly out of the way . Son and father sleep with the same girl ,    profane my holy name .   upon garment take in pledge   they recline beside any altar .    Wine at treasury expense   they drink in their temple .   yet it be I who destroy the Amorites before they ,   who be as tall as cedar ,   and as strong as oak tree . I destroy their fruit above   and their root beneath .    it be I who bring you up from the land of Egypt ,   and who lead you through the desert for forty year ,   to occupy the land of the Amorites ;   I who raise up prophet among your child ,   and nazirite    among your young man . be this not so , Israelites?\xe2\x80\x94   oracle of the   Lord .   but you make the nazirite drink wine ,   and command the prophet , do not prophesy !    look , I be groan beneath you ,   as a wagon groan when laden with sheaf .   Flight shall elude the swift ,   and the strong shall not retain strength ;   the warrior shall not save his life ,    nor shall the archer stand his ground ; the swift of foot shall not escape ,   nor shall the horseman save his life .   and the most stouthearte of warrior   shall flee naked on that day\xe2\x80\x94   oracle of the   Lord .
