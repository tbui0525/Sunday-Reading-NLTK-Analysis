b '    whoever might vainly hope to do so   need only see he to be overthrow .   no one be fierce enough to arouse he ;   who then dares stand before I ?   whoever have assail I , I will pay back\xe2\x80\x94   everything under the heavens be mine .   I need hardly mention his limb ,   his strength , and the fitness of his equipment .   who can strip off his outer garment ,   or penetrate his double armor ?   who can force open the door of his face ,   close to his terrible tooth ?   row of scale be on his back ,   tightly seal together ;   they be fit so close to each other   that no air can come between they ;   so join to one another   that they hold fast and can not be part .   when he sneeze , light flash forth ;   his eye be like the eyelid of the dawn .   out of his mouth go forth torch ;   spark of fire leap forth .   from his nostril come smoke   as from a seethe pot or bowl .   his breath set coal afire ;   a flame come from his mouth .   strength abide in his neck ,   and power leap before he .   the fold of his flesh stick together ,   it be cast over he and immovable .   his heart be cast as hard as stone ;   cast as the low millstone .   when he rise up , the god be afraid ;   when he crash down , they fall back .   should a sword reach he , it will not avail ;   nor will spear , dart , or javelin .   he regard iron as chaff ,   and bronze as rotten wood .   no arrow will put he to flight ;   slingstone use against he be but straw .   club he regard as straw ;   he laugh at the crash of the spear .   under he be sharp pottery fragment ,   spread a threshing sledge upon the mire .   he make the depth boil like a pot ;   he make the sea like a perfume bottle .   behind he he leave a shine path ;   you would think the deep have white hair .   upon the earth there be none like he ,   he be make fearless .   he look over all who be haughty ,   he be king over all proud beast .
