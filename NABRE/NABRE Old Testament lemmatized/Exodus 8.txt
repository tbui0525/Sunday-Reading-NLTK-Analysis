b '    the   Lord   then speak to Moses : speak to Aaron : stretch out your hand with your staff over the stream , the canal , and the pond , and make frog overrun the land of Egypt .      so Aaron stretch out his hand over the water of Egypt , and the frog come up and cover the land of Egypt .      but the magician do the same by their magic art and make frog overrun the land of Egypt .     then Pharaoh summon Moses and Aaron and say , pray to the   Lord   to remove the frog from I and my people , and I will let the people go to sacrifice to the   Lord .      Moses answer Pharaoh , please designate for I the time when I be to pray for you and your servant and your people , to get rid of the frog from you and your house . they will be leave only in the Nile .      tomorrow , he say . then Moses reply , it will be as you have say , so that you may know that there be none like the   Lord , our God .      the frog will leave you and your house , your servant and your people ; they will be leave only in the Nile .     after Moses and Aaron leave Pharaohs presence , Moses cry out to the   Lord   on account of the frog that he have inflict on Pharaoh ;      and the   Lord   do as Moses have ask . the frog die off in the house , the courtyard , and the field .      heap of they be pile up , and the land stank .      but when Pharaoh see there be a respite , he become obstinate and would not listen to they , just as the   Lord   have say .    third plague : the Gnats .     thereupon the   Lord   speak to Moses : speak to Aaron : stretch out your staff and strike the dust of the earth , and it will turn into gnat     throughout the land of Egypt .      they do so . Aaron stretch out his hand with his staff and strike the dust of the earth , and gnat come upon human being and beast alike . all the dust of the earth turn into gnat throughout the land of Egypt .      though the magician do the same thing to produce gnat by their magic art , they could not do so .    the gnat be on human being and beast alike ,      and the magician say to Pharaoh , this be the finger of God .    yet Pharaoh harden his heart and would not listen to they , just as the   Lord   have say .    fourth plague : the fly .     then the   Lord   speak to Moses : early tomorrow morning present yourself to Pharaoh when he set out toward the water , and say to he : thus say the   Lord : let my people go to serve I .      for if you do not let my people go , I will send swarm of fly upon you and your servant and your people and your house . the house of the Egyptians and the very ground on which they stand will be fill with swarm of fly .      but on that day I will make an exception of the land of Goshen , where my people be , and no swarm of fly will be there , so that you may know that I the   Lord   be in the midst of the land .      I will make a distinction    between my people and your people . this sign will take place tomorrow .      this the   Lord   do . thick swarm of fly enter the house of Pharaoh and the house of his servant ; throughout Egypt the land be devastate on account of the swarm of fly .      then Pharaoh summon Moses and Aaron and say , go sacrifice to your God within the land .      but Moses reply , it be not right to do so , for what we sacrifice to the   Lord , our God , be abhorrent to the Egyptians .    if we sacrifice what be abhorrent to the Egyptians before their very eye , will they not stone we ?      we must go a three day journey in the wilderness and sacrifice to the   Lord , our God , as he command we .      Pharaoh say , I will let you go to sacrifice to the   Lord , your God , in the wilderness , provide that you do not go too far away . pray for I .      Moses answer , as soon as I leave you I will pray to the   Lord   that the swarm of fly may depart tomorrow from Pharaoh , his servant , and his people . Pharaoh , however , must not act deceitfully again and refuse to let the people go to sacrifice to the   Lord .      when Moses leave Pharaoh , he pray to the   Lord ;      and the   Lord   do as Moses have ask , remove the swarm of fly from Pharaoh , his servant , and his people . not one remain .      but once more Pharaoh become obstinate and would not let the people go .
