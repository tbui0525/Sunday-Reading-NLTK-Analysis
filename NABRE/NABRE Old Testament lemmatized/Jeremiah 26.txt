b '    Jeremiah threaten with Death .     in the beginning of the reign    of Jehoiakim , son of Josiah , king of Judah , this word come from the   Lord :      thus say the   Lord : stand in the court of the house of the   Lord   and speak to the inhabitant of all the city of Judah who come to worship in the house of the   Lord ; whatever I command you , tell they , and hold nothing back .        perhaps they will listen and turn , all of they from their evil way , so that I may repent of the evil I plan to inflict upon they for their evil deed .        say to they : thus say the   Lord : if you do not obey I , by walk accord to the law I set before you      and listen to the word of my servant the prophet , whom I keep send you , even though you do not listen to they ,        I will treat this house like Shiloh , and make this city a curse for all the nation of the earth .      now the priest , the prophet , and all the people hear Jeremiah speak these word in the house of the   Lord .      when Jeremiah finish speak all that the   Lord   command he to speak to all the people , then the priest , the prophet , and all the people lay hold of he , cry , you must die !      why do you prophesy in the name of the   Lord : this house shall become like Shiloh , and this city shall be desolate , without inhabitant ? and all the people crowd around Jeremiah in the house of the   Lord .     when the prince of Judah hear about these thing , they come up from the house of the king to the house of the   Lord   and convene at the New Gate of the house of the   Lord .      the priest and prophet say to the prince and to all the people , sentence this man to death ! he have prophesy against this city ! you hear it with your own ear .        Jeremiah say to the prince and all the people : it be the   Lord   who send I to prophesy against this house and city everything you have hear .      now , therefore , reform your way and your deed ; listen to the voice of the   Lord   your God , so that the   Lord   will have a change of heart regard the evil he have speak against you .        as for I , I be in your hand ; do with I what be good and right in your eye .      but you should certainly know that by put I to death , you bring innocent blood on yourself , on this city and its inhabitant . for in truth it be the   Lord   who send I to you , to speak all these word for you to hear .     then the prince and all the people say to the priest and the prophet , this man do not deserve a death sentence ; it be in the name of the   Lord , our God , that he speak to we .      at this , some of the elder of the land arise and say to the whole assembly of the people ,      Micah of Moresheth    use to prophesy in the day of Hezekiah , king of Judah , and he say to all the people of Judah : thus say the   Lord   of host : Zion shall be plow as a field ,   Jerusalem , a heap of ruin ,   and the temple mount ,   a forest ridge .      do Hezekiah , king of Judah , and all Judah condemn he to death ? do he not fear the   Lord   and entreat the favor of the   Lord , so that the   Lord   have a change of heart regard the evil he have speak against they ? we , however , be about to do great evil against ourselves .     the Fate of Uriah .     there be another man who use to prophesy in the name of the   Lord , Uriah , son of Shemaiah , from Kiriath - jearim ; he prophesy against this city and this land the same message as Jeremiah .      when King Jehoiakim and all his officer and prince hear his word , the king seek to have he kill . but Uriah hear of it and flee in fear to Egypt .      then King Jehoiakim send Elnathan , son of Achbor , and other with he into Egypt ,      and they bring Uriah out of Egypt and take he to Jehoiakim the king , who strike he down with the sword and throw his corpse into the common burial ground .      but the hand of Ahikam , son of Shaphan ,    protect Jeremiah , so they do not hand he over to the people to be put to death .
