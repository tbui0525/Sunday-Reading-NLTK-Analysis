b ' Humble Trust in God   a song of ascent . of David . Lord , my heart be not proud ;   nor be my eye haughty . I do not busy myself with great matter ,   with thing too sublime for I .    rather , I have still my soul , like a wean child to its mother ,   wean be my soul .    Israel , hope in the   Lord ,   now and forever .             '
