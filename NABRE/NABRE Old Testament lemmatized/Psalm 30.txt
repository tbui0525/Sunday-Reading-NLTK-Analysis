b ' Thanksgiving for Deliverance   a psalm . a song for the dedication of the Temple .    of David .    I   I praise you ,   Lord , for you raise I up   and do not let my enemy rejoice over I .   o   Lord , my God ,   I cry out to you for help and you heal    I .   Lord , you bring my soul up from Sheol ;   you let I live , from go down to the pit .      II   sing praise to the   Lord , you faithful ;   give thank to his holy memory .   for his anger last but a moment ;   his favor a lifetime . at dusk weeping come for the night ;   but at dawn there be rejoice .    III   Complacent ,    I once say ,   I shall never be shake .   Lord , you show I favor ,   establish for I mountain of virtue . but when you hide your face   I be strike with terror .    to you ,   Lord , I cry out ;   with the Lord I plead for mercy :    what gain be there from my lifeblood ,   from my go down to the grave ? do dust give you thank   or declare your faithfulness ?   hear , O   Lord , have mercy on I ;   Lord , be my helper .    IV   you change my mourning into dancing ;   you take off my sackcloth   and clothe I with gladness .    so that my glory may praise you   and not be silent . o   Lord , my God ,   forever will I give you thank .
