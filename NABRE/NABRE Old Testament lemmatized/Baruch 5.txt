b '    Jerusalem , take off your robe of mourning and misery ;   put on forever the splendor of glory from God :    wrap in the mantle of justice from God ,   place on your head the diadem   of the glory of the Eternal One .    for God will show your splendor to all under the heavens ;    you will be name by God forever :   the peace of justice , the glory of Gods worship .      rise up , Jerusalem ! stand upon the height ;   look to the east and see your child gather from east to west   at the word of the Holy One ,   rejoice that they be remember by God .   lead away on foot by their enemy they leave you :   but God will bring they back to you   carry high in glory as on royal throne .    for God have command   that every lofty mountain   and the age - old hill be make low , that the valley be fill to make level ground ,   that Israel may advance securely in the glory of God .    the forest and every kind of fragrant tree   have overshadow Israel at Gods command ;    for God be lead Israel in joy   by the light of his glory ,   with the mercy and justice that be his .
