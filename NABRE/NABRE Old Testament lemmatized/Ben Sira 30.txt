b '   the Training of Children    whoever love a son will chastise he often ,   that he may be his joy when he grow up .    whoever discipline a son will benefit from he ,   and boast of he among acquaintance .   whoever educate a son will make his enemy jealous ,   and rejoice in he among his friend .   at the father death , he will seem not dead ,   for he leave after he one like himself ,   whom he look upon through life with joy ,   and in death , without regret .   against his enemy he have leave an avenger ,   and one to repay his friend with kindness .     whoever spoil a son will have wound to bandage ,   and will suffer heartache at every cry .   an untamed horse turn out stubborn ;   and a son leave to himself grow up unruly .   pamper a child and he will be a terror for you ,   indulge he , and he will bring you grief .   do not laugh with he lest you share sorrow with he ,   and in the end you will gnash your tooth .   do not give he his own way in his youth ,   and do not ignore his folly .   bow down his head in his youth ,   beat his side while he be still young , lest he become stubborn and disobey you ,   and leave you disconsolate .    discipline your son and make heavy his yoke ,   lest you be offend by his shamelessness .    Health and Cheerfulness    well the poor in vigorous health   than the rich with bodily ill .   I would rather have bodily health than any gold ,   and contentment of spirit than pearl .   no rich be great than a healthy body ;   and no happiness than a joyful heart .   well be death than a wretched life ,    everlasting sleep than constant illness .   good thing set before one who can not eat   be like food offering place before a tomb .     what good be an offering to an idol   that can neither eat nor smell ? so it be with the one be punish by the Lord ,    who groan at what his eye behold .     do not give in to sadness ,   or torment yourself deliberately .    gladness of heart be the very life of a person ,   and cheerfulness prolong his day .   distract yourself and renew your courage ,   drive resentment far away from you ; for grief have kill many ,    and nothing be to be gain from resentment .   Envy and anger shorten one day ,   and anxiety bring on premature old age .   those who be cheerful and merry at table   benefit from their food .               '
