b '   Joys and Miseries of Life   a great anxiety have God allot ,    and a heavy yoke , to the child of Adam ,   from the day they leave their mother womb   until the day they return to the mother of all the living .    trouble thought and fear of heart be theirs   and anxious foreboding until death .   whether one sit on a lofty throne   or grovel in dust and ashe ,   whether one wear a splendid crown   or be clothe in the coarse of garments\xe2\x80\x94   there be wrath and envy , trouble and dread ,   terror of death , fury and strife . even when one lie on his bed to rest ,   his care disturb his sleep at night .   so short be his rest it seem like none ,   till in his dream he struggle as he do by day , trouble by the vision of his mind ,   like a fugitive flee from the pursuer .   as he reach safety , he wake up ,   astonish that there be nothing to fear .   to all flesh , human being and beast ,   but for sinner seven time more ,   come plague and bloodshed , fiery heat and drought ,   plunder and ruin , famine and death .    for the wicked evil be create ,   and because of they destruction hasten .     all that be of earth return to earth ,   and what be from above return above .    all that come from bribe or injustice will be wipe out ,   but loyalty remain forever .   Wealth from injustice be like a flooding wadi ,   like a mighty stream with lightning and thunder ,   which , in its rise , roll along the stone ,   but suddenly , once and for all , come to an end .    the offshoot of violence will not flourish ,   for the root of the godless be on sheer rock .   they be like reed on riverbank ,   wither before all other plant ;   but goodness , like eternity , will never be cut off ,   and righteousness endure forever .     Wealth or wage can make life sweet ,    but well than either , find a treasure .   a child or a city will preserve one name ,   but well than either , find wisdom . Cattle and orchard make a person flourish ;   but well than either , a devoted wife .    wine and strong drink delight the soul ,   but well than either , love of friend .    flute and harp offer sweet melody ,   but well than either , a pure tongue .   grace and beauty delight the eye ,   but well than either , the produce of the field .   a friend and a neighbor be timely guide ,   but well than either , a sensible wife .   relative and helper for time of stress ;   but well than either , charity that rescue .   Gold and silver make one way secure ,   but well than either , sound judgment .   Wealth and vigor make the heart exult ,   but well than either , fear of God . in the fear of the Lord there be no want ;   whoever have it need seek no other support .   the fear of God be a paradise of blessing ;   its canopy be over all that be glorious .      my son , do not live the life of a beggar ;    well to die than to beg .   when one have to look to a stranger table ,   life be not worth live . the delicacy offer bring revulsion of spirit ,   and to the intelligent , inward torture .    in the mouth of the shameless begging be sweet ,   but within he it burn like fire .
