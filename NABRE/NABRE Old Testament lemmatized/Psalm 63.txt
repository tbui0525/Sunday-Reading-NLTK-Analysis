b ' Ardent longing for God   a psalm of David , when he be in the wilderness of Judah .     I   o God , you be my god\xe2\x80\x94   it be you I seek ! for you my body yearn ;   for you my soul thirst , in a land parch , lifeless ,   and without water .    I look to you in the sanctuary   to see your power and glory .   for your love be well than life ;    my lip shall ever praise you !    II   I will bless you as long as I live ;   I will lift up my hand , call on your name .   my soul shall be sate as with choice food ,   with joyous lip my mouth shall praise you !   I think of you upon my bed ,   I remember you through the watch of the night   you indeed be my savior ,   and in the shadow of your wing I shout for joy .    my soul cling fast to you ;   your right hand uphold I .    III   but those who seek my life will come to ruin ;   they shall go down to the depth of the netherworld !    those who would hand over my life to the sword shall   become the prey of jackal !   but the king shall rejoice in God ;   all who swear by the Lord    shall exult ,   but the mouth of liar will be shut !
