b '    Lord , Father and Master of my life ,    do not abandon I to their design ,   do not let I fall because of they !     who will apply the lash to my thought ,   and to my mind the rod of discipline , that my failing may not be spare   or the sin of my heart overlook ?   otherwise my failing may increase ,   and my sin be multiply ; and I fall before my adversary ,   and my enemy rejoice over I ?   Lord , Father and God of my life ,   do not give I haughty eye ;    remove evil desire from my heart .   let neither gluttony nor lust overcome I ;   do not give I up to shameless desire .     Proper Use of the Tongue    listen , my child , to instruction concern the mouth ,   for whoever keep it will not be ensnare .   through the lip the sinner be catch ;   by they the reviler and the arrogant be trip up .   do not accustom your mouth to oath ,   or habitually utter the Holy Name .    just as a servant constantly under scrutiny   will not be without bruise , so one who swear continually by the Holy Name   will never remain free from sin .   those who swear many oath heap up offense ;   and the scourge will never be far from their house . if they swear in error , guilt be incur ;   if they neglect their obligation , the sin be doubly great .   if they swear without reason they can not be declare innocent ,   for their household will be fill with calamity .     there be word comparable to death ;   may they never be hear in the inheritance of Jacob . to the devout all such word be foreign ;   they do not wallow in sin .   do not accustom your mouth to coarse talk ,   for it involve sinful speech .   keep your father and mother in mind   when you sit among the mighty ,   lest you forget yourself in their presence   and disgrace your upbringing . then you will wish you have never be bear   and will curse the day of your birth .   those accustom to use abusive language   will never acquire discipline as long as they live .    sin of the Flesh    two type of people multiply sin ,   and a third    draw down wrath : burn passion be like a blaze fire ,   not to be quench till it burn itself out ; one unchaste with his kindred   never stop until fire break forth .   to the unchaste all bread be sweet ;   he be never through till he die .      the man who dishonor his marriage bed   say to himself , who can see I ? darkness surround I , wall hide I ,   no one see I . who can stop I from sin ?   he be not mindful of the most high ,    fear only human eye . he do not realize that the eye of the Lord ,   ten thousand time bright than the sun , observe every step take   and peer into hide corner .   the one who know all thing before they exist   still know they all after they be make .   such a man will be denounce in the street of the city ;    and where he least suspect it , he will be apprehend .     so it be with the woman unfaithful to her husband ,   who offer he an heir by another man .   first of all , she have disobey the law of the most high ;   second , she have wrong her husband ; third , through her wanton adultery   she have bring forth child by another man .   such a woman will be drag before the assembly ,    and her punishment will extend to her child .   her child will not take root ;   her branch will not bring forth fruit .   she will leave behind an accursed memory ;   her disgrace will never be blot out .     thus all who dwell on the earth shall know ,   all who remain in the world shall understand , that nothing be well than the fear of the Lord ,   nothing sweet than obey the commandment of the Lord .
