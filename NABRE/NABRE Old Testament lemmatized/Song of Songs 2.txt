b '    W   I be a flower of Sharon ,    a lily of the valley .   M   like a lily among thorn ,   so be my friend among woman .   W   like an apple tree among the tree of the wood ,   so be my lover among man . in his shadow    I delight to sit ,   and his fruit be sweet to my taste .    he bring I to the banquet hall    and his glance at I signal love .    strengthen I with raisin cake ,    refresh I with apple ,   for I be sick with love .    his left hand be under my head   and his right arm embrace I .    I adjure you , daughter of Jerusalem ,    by the gazelle and the doe of the field , do not awaken , or stir up love   until it be ready .    her Lovers visit remember   W   the sound of my lover ! here he comes    spring across the mountain ,   leap across the hill .   my lover be like a gazelle    or a young stag . see ! he be stand behind our wall ,   gaze through the window ,   peer through the lattice .   my lover speak and say to I ,   M   Arise , my friend , my beautiful one ,   and come !   for see , the winter be past ,   the rain be over and go .   the flower appear on the earth ,   the time of prune the vine have come ,   and the song of the turtledove be hear in our land .   the fig tree put forth its fig ,   and the vine , in bloom , give forth fragrance . arise , my friend , my beautiful one ,   and come !   my dove in the cleft of the rock ,    in the secret recess of the cliff , let I see your face ,   let I hear your voice , for your voice be sweet ,   and your face be lovely .   W   catch we the fox ,    the little fox   that damage the vineyard ; for our vineyard be in bloom !    my lover belong to I and I to he ;   he feed among the lily .    until the day grow cool    and the shadow flee ,   roam , my lover , like a gazelle or a young stag   upon the rugged mountain .
