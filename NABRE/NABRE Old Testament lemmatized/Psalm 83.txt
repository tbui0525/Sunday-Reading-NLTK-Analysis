b ' prayer against a Hostile Alliance   a song ; a psalm of Asaph .    I   God , do not be silent ;   God , do not be deaf or remain unmoved !    see how your enemy rage ;   your foe proudly raise their head .   they conspire against your people ,   plot against those you protect .    they say , come , let we wipe they out as a nation ;   let Israels name be remember no more !   they scheme with one mind ,   they have enter into a covenant against you :     the tent of Edom and the Ishmaelites ,   of Moab and the Hagrites ,    Gebal , Ammon , and Amalek ,    Philistia and the inhabitant of Tyre .    Assyria , too , in league with they ,   back the descendant of Lot . Selah    II    Deal with they as with Midian ;   as with Sisera and Jabin at the wadi Kishon ,    those destroy at Endor ,   who become dung for the ground .    make their noble like Oreb and Zeeb ,   all their prince like Zebah and Zalmunna ,   who make a plan together ,   let we take for ourselves the pasture of God .   my God , make they like tumbleweed ,   into chaff fly before the wind .    as a fire rage through a forest ,   a flame set mountain ablaze ,    pursue they with your tempest ;   terrify they with your storm - wind .   cover their face with shame ,   till they seek your name ,     Lord .   let they be ashamed and terrify forever ;   let they perish in disgrace .   let they know that your name be   Lord ,   you alone be the most high over all the earth .
