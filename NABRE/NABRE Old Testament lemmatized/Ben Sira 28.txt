b '    the vengeful will face the Lords vengeance ;   indeed he remember their sin in detail .      forgive your neighbor the wrong do to you ;   then when you pray , your own sin will be forgive .    do anyone nourish anger against another   and expect healing from the   Lord ?    can one refuse mercy to a sinner like oneself ,   yet seek pardon for one own sin ?   if a mere mortal cherish wrath ,   who will forgive his sin ?   remember your last day and set enmity aside ;   remember death and decay , and cease from sin !    remember the commandment and do not be angry with your neighbor ;   remember the covenant of the most high , and overlook fault .     avoid strife and your sin will be few ,   for the hot - temper kindle strife ;   the sinner disrupt friendship   and sow discord among those who be at peace .    the more the wood , the great the fire ,    the more the cruelty , the fiercer the strife ; the great the strength , the sterner the anger ,   the great the wealth , the great the wrath .   Pitch and resin make fire flare up ,   and a hasty quarrel provoke bloodshed .    the Evil Tongue    if you blow on a spark , it turn into flame ,   if you spit on it , it die out ;   yet both you do with your mouth !   curse be gossip and the double - tongued ,   for they destroy the peace of many .    a meddlesome tongue subvert many ,   and make they refugee among people . it destroy strong city ,   and overthrow the house of the great .   a meddlesome tongue drive virtuous woman from their home ,   and rob they of the fruit of their toil .   whoever heed it will find no rest ,   nor will they dwell in peace .     a blow from a whip raise a welt ,   but a blow from the tongue will break bone .   many have fall by the edge of the sword ,   but not as many as by the tongue .    happy the one who be shelter from it ,   and have not endure its wrath ; who have not bear its yoke   nor be bind with its chain .   for its yoke be a yoke of iron ,   and its chain be chain of bronze ;   the death it inflict be an evil death ,   even Sheol be preferable to it .   it will have no power over the godly ,   nor will they be burn in its flame .   but those who forsake the Lord will fall victim to it ,   as it burn among they unquenchably ; it will hurl itself against they like a lion ,   and like a leopard , it will tear they to piece .   as you fence in your property with thorn ,   so make a door and a bolt for your mouth .    as you lock up your silver and gold ,   so make balance and scale for your word .   take care not to slip by your tongue   and fall victim to one lie in ambush .
