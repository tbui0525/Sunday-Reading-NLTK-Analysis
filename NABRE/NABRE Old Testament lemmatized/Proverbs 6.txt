b '   miscellaneous proverb   against go surety for Ones Neighbor    my son , if you have become surety to your neighbor ,    give your hand in pledge to another ,   you have be snare by the utterance of your lip ,   catch by the word of your mouth ;   so do this , my son , to free yourself ,   since you have fall into your neighbor power : go , hurry , rouse your neighbor !   give no sleep to your eye ,   nor slumber to your eyelid ;   free yourself like a gazelle from the hunter ,   or like a bird from the hand of the fowler .    the Ant and the Sluggard at Harvest    go to the ant ,    o sluggard ,   study her way and learn wisdom ;   for though she have no chief ,   no commander or ruler ,   she procure her food in the summer ,   store up her provision in the harvest .   how long , o sluggard , will you lie there ?   when will you rise from your sleep ?   a little sleep , a little slumber ,   a little folding of the arm to rest\xe2\x80\x94    then poverty will come upon you like a robber ,   and want like a brigand .    the Scoundrel    scoundrel , villain , be they   who deal in crooked talk .   Shifty of eye ,   foot ever move ,   point with finger ,   they have perversity in their heart ,   always plot evil ,   sow discord .   therefore their doom come suddenly ;   in an instant they be crush beyond cure .    what the Lord reject   there be six thing the   Lord   hate ,   yes , seven    be an abomination to he ;    haughty eye , a lie tongue ,   hand that shed innocent blood ,   a heart that plot wicked scheme ,   foot that be quick to run to evil ,   the false witness who utter lie ,   and the one who sow discord among kindred .    warn against Adultery    Observe , my son , your father command ,   and do not reject your mother teach ;   keep they fasten over your heart always ,   tie they around your neck .   when you lie down they    will watch over you ,   when you wake , they will share your concern ;   wherever you turn , they will guide you .   for the command be a lamp , and the teaching a light ,   and a way to life be the reproofs that discipline ,   keep you from another wife ,   from the smooth tongue of the foreign woman .    do not lust in your heart after her beauty ,   do not let she captivate you with her glance !    for the price of a harlot   may be scarcely a loaf of bread , but a married woman   be a trap for your precious life .    can a man take ember into his bosom ,   and his garment not be burn ?   or can a man walk on live coal ,   and his foot not be scorch ?   so with he who sleep with another wife\xe2\x80\x94   none who touch she shall go unpunished .    thief be not despise   if out of hunger they steal to satisfy their appetite .   yet if catch they must pay back sevenfold ,   yield up all the wealth of their house .   but those who commit adultery have no sense ;   those who do it destroy themselves .    they will be beat and disgrace ,   and their shame will not be wipe away ;   for passion enrage the husband ,   he will have no pity on the day of vengeance ;   he will not consider any restitution ,   nor be satisfied by your many bribe .
