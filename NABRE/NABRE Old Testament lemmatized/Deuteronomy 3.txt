b '   Defeat of Og .     then we turn and proceed up the road to Bashan . but Og , king of Bashan ,    come out against we with all his people to give battle at Edrei .      the   Lord   say to I , do not be afraid of he , for I have deliver he into your power with all his people and his land . do to he as you do to Sihon , king of the Amorites , who reign in Heshbon .      and thus the   Lord , our God , deliver into our power also Og , king of Bashan , with all his people . we defeat he so completely that we leave he no survivor .      at that time we capture all his city ; there be no town we do not take : sixty city in all , the whole region of Argob , the kingdom of Og in bashan\xe2\x80\x94      all these city be fortify with high wall and gate and bars\xe2\x80\x94beside a great number of unwalled town .       as we have do to Sihon , king of Heshbon , so also here we put all the town under the ban , man , woman and child ;      but all the livestock and the spoil of each city we take as plunder for ourselves .     and so at that time we take from the two king of the Amorites beyond the Jordan the territory from the Wadi Arnon to Mount Hermon      ( the Sidonians call Hermon Sirion and the Amorites call it Senir ) ,      all the town of the plateau , all of Gilead , and all of Bashan as far as Salecah and Edrei , town of the kingdom of Og in Bashan .      ( Og , king of Bashan , be the last remain survivor of the Rephaim . he have a bed of iron ,    nine regular cubit long and four wide , which be still preserve in Rabbah of the Ammonites . )     Allotment of the Conquered Lands .      as for the land we take possession of at that time , I give Reuben and Gad the territory from Aroer , on the edge of the Wadi Arnon , halfway up into the highland of Gilead , with its city .      the rest of Gilead and all of Bashan , the kingdom of Og , I give to the half - tribe of Manasseh . ( the whole Argob region , all that part of Bashan , be once call a land of the Rephaim .        Jair , a Manassite ,    take all the region of Argob as far as the border of the Geshurites and Maacathites , and name them\xe2\x80\x94Bashan , that is\xe2\x80\x94after himself , Havvoth - jair , the name it bear today . )      to Machir    I give Gilead ,      and to Reuben and Gad the territory from Gilead to the Wadi arnon\xe2\x80\x94the middle of the wadi be its boundary\xe2\x80\x94and to the Wadi Jabbok , which be the border of the Ammonites ,      as well as the Arabah with the Jordan and its bank from Chinnereth    to the Salt Sea of the Arabah , under the slope of Pisgah on the east .      at that time I charge you : the   Lord , your God , have give you this land as your possession . but all your troop equip for battle must cross over in the vanguard of your fellow Israelites .      but your wife and child , as well as your livestock , of which I know you have a large number , shall remain behind in the town I have give you ,      until the   Lord   have settle your relative as well , and they too possess the land which the   Lord , your God , will give they on the other side of the Jordan . then you may all return to the possession I have give you .     and I charge Joshua as well , your own eye have see all that the   Lord , your God , have do to both these king ; so , too , will the   Lord   do to all the kingdom into which you will cross over .      do not fear they , for it be the   Lord , your God , who will fight for you .     Moses exclude from the Promised Land .      it be then that I entreat the   Lord ,      Lord   God , you have begin to show to your servant your greatness and your mighty hand . what god in heaven or on earth can perform deed and powerful act like yours ?      ah , let I cross over and see the good land beyond the Jordan , that fine hill country , and the Lebanon !      but the   Lord   be angry with I on your account    and would not hear I .    the   Lord   say to I , enough ! speak to I no more of this .      go up to the top of Pisgah and look out to the west , and to the north , and to the south , and to the east . look well , for you shall not cross this Jordan .        Commission Joshua ,    and encourage and strengthen he , for it be he who will cross at the head of this people and he who will give they possession of the land you be to see .     so we remain in the valley opposite Beth - peor .
