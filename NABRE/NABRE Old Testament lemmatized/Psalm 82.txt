b ' the Downfall of Unjust Gods   a psalm of Asaph . I God take a stand in the divine council ,   give judgment in the midst of the god .    how long will you judge unjustly   and favor the cause of the wicked ?   Selah   defend the lowly and fatherless ;   render justice to the afflict and needy .   Rescue the lowly and poor ;   deliver they from the hand of the wicked .     II    the god neither know nor understand ,   wander about in darkness ,   and all the world foundation shake .   I declare : god though you be ,     offspring of the most high all of you ,   yet like any mortal you shall die ;   like any prince you shall fall .   Arise , o God , judge the earth ,    for your be all the nation .             '
