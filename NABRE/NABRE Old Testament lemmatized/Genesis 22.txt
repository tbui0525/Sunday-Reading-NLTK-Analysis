b '   the Testing of Abraham .      some time afterward , God put Abraham to the test and say to he : Abraham ! here I be ! he reply .        then God say : take your son Isaac , your only one , whom you love , and go to the land of Moriah . there offer he up as a burn offering on one of the height that I will point out to you .        early the next morning Abraham saddle his donkey , take with he two of his servant and his son Isaac , and after cut the wood for the burn offering , set out for the place of which God have tell he .     on the third day Abraham catch sight of the place from a distance .      Abraham say to his servant : stay here with the donkey , while the boy and I go on over there . we will worship and then come back to you .      so Abraham take the wood for the burn offering and lay it on his son Isaac , while he himself carry the fire and the knife . as the two walk on together ,      Isaac speak to his father Abraham . Father ! he say . here I be , he reply . Isaac continue , here be the fire and the wood , but where be the sheep for the burn offering ?      my son , Abraham answer , God will provide the sheep for the burn offering . then the two walk on together .     when they come to the place of which God have tell he , Abraham build an altar there and arrange the wood on it . next he bind    his son Isaac , and put he on top of the wood on the altar .        then Abraham reach out and take the knife to slaughter his son .        but the angel of the   Lord   call to he from heaven , Abraham , Abraham ! here I be , he answer .      do not lay your hand on the boy , say the angel . do not do the least thing to he . for now I know that you fear God , since you do not withhold from I your son , your only one .        Abraham look up and see a single ram catch by its horn in the thicket . so Abraham go and take the ram and offer it up as a burn offering in place of his son .        Abraham name that place Yahweh - yireh ;    hence people today say , on the mountain the   Lord   will provide .      a second time the angel of the   Lord   call to Abraham from heaven       and say : I swear by my very self\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord \xe2\x80\x94that because you act as you do in not withhold from I your son , your only one ,      I will bless you and make your descendant as countless as the star of the sky and the sand of the seashore ; your descendant will take possession of the gate of their enemy ,        and in your descendant all the nation of the earth will find blessing , because you obey my command .      Abraham then return to his servant , and they set out together for Beer - sheba , where Abraham live . Nahors Descendants .        some time afterward , the news come to Abraham : Milcah too have bear son to your brother Nahor :      Uz , his firstborn , his brother Buz , Kemuel the father of Aram ,      Chesed , Hazo , Pildash , Jidlaph , and Bethuel .
