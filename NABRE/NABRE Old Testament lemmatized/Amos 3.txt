b '    First Summons   hear this word , Israelites , that the   Lord   speak concern you ,   concern the whole family I bring up from the land of Egypt :   you alone I have know ,    among all the family of the earth ;   therefore I will punish you   for all your iniquity .      do two journey together   unless they have agree ?   do a lion roar in the forest   when it have no prey ? do a young lion cry out from its den   unless it have seize something ?   do a bird swoop down on a trap on the ground   when there be no lure for it ? do a snare spring up from the ground   without catch anything ?   do the ram horn sound in a city   without the people become frightened ? do disaster befall a city   unless the   Lord   have cause it ?      ( indeed , the Lord   God   do nothing without reveal his plan to his servant the prophet . )     the lion have roar ,   who would not fear ?   the Lord   God   have speak ,   who would not prophesy ?     proclaim this in the stronghold of Assyria ,    in the stronghold of the land of Egypt : gather on the mount of Samaria ,   and see the great disorder within it ,   the oppression within its midst .    they do not know how to do what be right\xe2\x80\x94   oracle of the   Lord \xe2\x80\x94 store up in their stronghold   violence and destruction .   therefore thus say the Lord   God : an enemy shall surround the land ,   tear down your fortress ,   and pillage your stronghold .   thus say the   Lord : as the shepherd rescue from the mouth of the lion   a pair of sheep leg or the tip of an ear , so shall the Israelites escape ,   those who dwell in Samaria , with the corner of a couch   or a piece of a cot .      hear and bear witness against the house of Jacob\xe2\x80\x94   an oracle of the Lord   God , the God of host :   on the day when I punish Israel for its crime ,   I will also punish the altar of Bethel ; the horn of the altar shall be break off   and fall to the ground .     I will strike the winter house   and the summer house ; the house of ivory shall lie in ruin ,   and their many room shall be no more\xe2\x80\x94   oracle of the   Lord .             '
