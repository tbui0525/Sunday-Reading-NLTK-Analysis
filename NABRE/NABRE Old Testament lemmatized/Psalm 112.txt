b ' the blessing of the just   Hallelujah ! bless the man who fear the   Lord ,   who greatly delight in his command .    his descendant shall be mighty in the land ,   a generation of the upright will be bless .   Wealth and rich shall be in his house ;   his righteousness    shall endure forever .   light shine through the darkness for the upright ;    gracious , compassionate , and righteous .   it be good for the man gracious in lending ,   who conduct his affair with justice .   for he shall never be shake ;   the righteous shall be remember forever .    he shall not fear an ill report ;   his heart be steadfast , trust the   Lord .   his heart be tranquil , without fear ,   till at last he look down on his foe .   lavishly he give to the poor ;   his righteousness shall endure forever ;    his horn    shall be exalt in honor .   the wicked see and be angry ;   gnash his tooth and waste away ;   the desire of the wicked come to nothing .
