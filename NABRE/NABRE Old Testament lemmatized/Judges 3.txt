b '    these be the nation the   Lord   allow to remain , so that through they he might test Israel , all those who have not experience any of the canaanite wars\xe2\x80\x94      to teach warfare to those generation of Israelites who have never experience it :       the five lord of the Philistines ,    and all the Canaanites , the Sidonians , and the Hivites who live in the mountain region of the Lebanon between Baal - hermon and Lebo - hamath .      these serve as a test for Israel , to know whether they would obey the commandment the   Lord   have enjoin on their ancestor through Moses .      so the Israelites settle among the Canaanites , Hittites , Amorites , Perizzites , Hivites , and Jebusites .        they take their daughter in marriage , and give their own daughter to their son in marriage ,    and serve their god .     Othniel .      then the Israelites do what be evil in the sight of the   Lord ; they forget the   Lord , their God , and serve the Baals and the Asherahs ,        and the anger of the   Lord   flare up against they . he sell they into the power of Cushan - rishathaim ,    king of Aram Naharaim ; and the Israelites serve Cushan - rishathaim for eight year .      but when the Israelites cry out to the   Lord ,    he raise up a savior for they , to save they . it be Othniel , son of Calebs young brother Kenaz .        the spirit of the   Lord   come upon he ,    and he judge Israel . when he march out to war , the   Lord   deliver Cushan - rishathaim , king of Aram , into his power , and his hold on Cushan - rishathaim be firm .      so the land be at rest for forty year ,    until Othniel , son of Kenaz , die .    Ehud .     again the Israelites do what be evil in the sight of the   Lord , so he strengthen Eglon , king of Moab , against Israel because they do what be evil in the sight of the   Lord .      take the Ammonites and Amalek as ally , he go and defeat Israel , take possession of the City of Palms .      so the Israelites serve Eglon , king of Moab , for eighteen year .     but when the Israelites cry out to the   Lord , he raise up for they a savior , Ehud , son of Gera , a Benjaminite who be leave - handed .    the Israelites would send their tribute to Eglon , king of Moab , by he .      Ehud make himself a two - edge dagger a foot long , and strap it under his clothe on his right thigh .      he present the tribute to Eglon , king of Moab ; now Eglon be a very fat man .      when he have finish present the tribute , he dismiss the troop who have carry the tribute .      but he himself turn back at the sculptured stone near Gilgal , and say , I have a secret message for you , o king . and the king say , silence ! then when all his attendant have leave his presence ,      Ehud go in to he where he sit alone in his cool upper room . Ehud say , I have a word from God for you . so the king rise from his throne .      then Ehud with his left hand draw the dagger from his right thigh , and thrust it into Eglons belly .      the hilt also go in after the blade , and the fat close over the blade because he do not withdraw the dagger from the body .     then Ehud go out onto the porch , shut the door of the upper room on Eglon and lock they .      when Ehud have leave and the servant have come , they see that the door of the upper room be lock , and think , he must be ease himself in the cool chamber .      they wait until they be at a loss when he do not open the door of the upper room . so they take the key and open they , and there be their lord lie on the floor , dead .     during their delay Ehud escape and , pass the sculptured stone , take refuge in Seirah .      on his arrival he sound the horn in the mountain region of Ephraim , and the Israelites go down from the mountain with he as their leader .      follow I , he say to they , for the   Lord   have deliver your enemy the Moabites into your power .    so they follow he down and seize the ford of the Jordan against the Moabites , permit no one to cross .      on that occasion they slew about ten thousand Moabites , all of they strong warrior . not one escape .      so Moab be bring under the power of Israel    at that time ; and the land have rest for eighty year .     Shamgar .     after he there be Shamgar ,    son of Anath ,    who slew six hundred Philistines with an oxgoad .    he , too , be a savior for Israel .             '
