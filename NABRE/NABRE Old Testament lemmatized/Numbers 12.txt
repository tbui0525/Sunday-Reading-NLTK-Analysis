b '   Jealousy of Aaron and Miriam .     Miriam and Aaron speak against Moses on the pretext of the cushite woman he have marry ; for he have in fact marry a cushite woman .        they complain ,    be it through Moses alone that the   Lord   have speak ? have he not speak through we also ? and the   Lord   hear this .       now the man Moses be very humble , more than anyone else on earth .      so at once the   Lord   say to Moses and Aaron and Miriam : come out , you three , to the tent of meeting . and the three of they go .      then the   Lord   come down in a column of cloud , and stand at the entrance of the tent , call , Aaron and Miriam . when both come forward ,      the   Lord   say : now listen to my word : if there be prophet among you ,   in vision I reveal myself to they ,   in dream I speak to they ;   not so with my servant Moses ! throughout my house he be worthy of trust :      face to face I speak to he ,    plainly and not in riddle . the likeness of the   Lord   he behold . why , then , do you not fear to speak against my servant Moses ?      and so the   Lord s wrath flare against they , and he depart .    Miriams Punishment .     now the cloud withdraw from the tent , and there be Miriam ,    stricken with a scaly infection , white as snow !    when Aaron turn toward Miriam and see she stricken with snow - white scale ,      he say to Moses , ah , my lord ! please do not charge we with the sin that we have foolishly commit !      do not let she be like the stillborn baby that come forth from its mother womb with its flesh half consume .      then Moses cry to the   Lord , please , not this ! please , heal she !      but the   Lord   answer Moses : suppose her father have spit in her face , would she not bear her shame for seven day ? let she be confine outside the camp for seven day ; afterwards she may be bring back .      so Miriam be confine outside the camp for seven day , and the people do not start out again until she be bring back .     after that the people set out from Hazeroth and encamp in the wilderness of Paran .
