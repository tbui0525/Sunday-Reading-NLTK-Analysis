b '   the Divine Warrior    who be this that come from Edom ,   in crimsoned garment , from Bozrah ? who be this , glorious in his apparel ,   stride in the greatness of his strength ? it be I , I who announce vindication ,   mighty to save .    why be your apparel red ,   and your garment like one who tread the wine press ?    the wine press I have tread alone ,   and from the people no one be with I . I trod they in my anger ,   and trample they down in my wrath ; their blood spurt on my garment ,   all my apparel I stain .   for a day of vindication be in my heart ,   my year for redeeming have come .    I look about , but there be no one to help ,   I be appal that there be no one to lend support ; so my own arm bring I victory   and my own wrath lend I support .    I trample down the people in my anger ,   I make they drunk in my wrath ,   and I pour out their blood upon the ground .    prayer for the Return of Gods favor    the love deed of the   Lord   I will recall ,   the glorious act of the   Lord , because of all the   Lord   have do for we ,   the immense goodness to the house of Israel , which he have grant accord to his mercy   and his many loving deed .    he say : they be indeed my people ,   child who be not disloyal . so he become their savior    in their every affliction . it be not an envoy or a messenger ,   but his presence that save they . because of his love and pity   the   Lord   redeem they , lift they up and carry they   all the day of old .    but they rebel   and grieve his holy spirit ; so he turn to become their enemy ,   and war against they .      then they remember the day of old , of Moses , his servant : where be the one who bring up out of the sea   the shepherd of his flock ? where be the one who place in their midst   his holy spirit ,    who guide Moses by the hand ,   with his glorious arm ? where be the one who divide the water before them\xe2\x80\x94   win for himself an everlasting renown\xe2\x80\x94   who guide they through the depth ,   like horse in open country ?   as cattle go down into the valley ,   they do not stumble .   the spirit of the   Lord   guide they . thus you lead your people ,   to make for yourself a glorious name .   look down from heaven and regard we   from your holy and glorious palace ! where be your zealous care and your might ,   your surge of pity ?   your mercy hold not back !    for you be our father . be Abraham not to know we ,   nor Israel to acknowledge we , you ,   Lord , be our father ,   our redeemer you be name from of old .   why do you make we wander ,   Lord , from your way ,   and harden our heart so that we do not fear you ?   return for the sake of your servant ,   the tribe of your heritage .   why have the wicked invade your holy place ,   why have our enemy trample your sanctuary ?    too long have we be like those you do not rule ,   on whom your name be not invoke . oh , that you would rend the heaven and come down ,   with the mountain quake before you ,              '
