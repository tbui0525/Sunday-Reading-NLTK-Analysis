b '   the Wise Woman of Tekoa .     now Joab , son of Zeruiah , know how the king feel toward Absalom .      Joab send to Tekoa and bring from there a wise woman , to whom he say : pretend to be in mourning . put on mourn apparel and do not anoint yourself with oil , that you may appear to be a woman who have long be mourn someone dead .      then go to the king and speak to he in this manner . and Joab tell she what to say .     so the woman of Tekoa go to the king and fall to the ground in homage , say , help , o king !       the king say to she , what do you want ? she reply : alas , I be a widow ; my husband be dead .      your servant have two son , who quarrel in the field , with no one to part they , and one of they strike his brother and kill he .      then the whole clan confront your servant and demand : give up the one who strike down his brother . we must put he to death for the life of his brother whom he have kill ; we must do away with the heir also . thus they will quench my remain hope    and leave my husband neither name nor posterity upon the earth .        the king then say to the woman : go home . I will issue a command on your behalf .      the woman of Tekoa answer he , upon I and my family be the blame , my lord king ; the king and his throne be innocent .      then the king say , if anyone say a word to you , have he bring to I , and he shall not touch you again .      but she say , please , let the king remember the   Lord   your God , that the avenger of blood may not go too far in destruction and that my son may not be do away with . he reply , as the   Lord   live , not a hair of your son shall fall to the ground .     but the woman continue , please let your servant say still another word to my lord the king . he reply , speak .      so the woman say : why , then , do you think the way you do against the people of God ? in pronounce as he have , the king show himself guilty , in not bring back his own banish son .      we must indeed die ; we be then like water that be pour out on the ground and can not be gather up . yet , though God do not bring back to life , he do devise mean so as not to banish    anyone from he .        and now , if I have presume to speak to the king of this matter , it be because the people have give I cause to fear . and so your servant think : let I speak to the king . perhaps he will grant the petition of his servant .      for the king must surely listen and rescue his servant from the grasp of one who would destroy both I and my son from the heritage of God .      and your servant say , let the word of my lord the king lead to rest ;    indeed , my lord the king be like an angel of God , discern good and evil . the   Lord   your God be with you .      the king answer the woman , now do not conceal from I anything I may ask you ! the woman say , let my lord the king speak .      so the king ask , be the hand of Joab with you in all this ? and the woman answer : as you live , my lord the king , it be just as my lord have say , and not otherwise . it be your servant Joab who instruct I and tell your servant all these thing she be to say .      your servant Joab do this in order to approach the matter in a roundabout way . but my lord be wise with the wisdom of an angel of God , know all thing on earth .    Absaloms Return .     then the king say to Joab : I be grant this request . go and bring back young Absalom .      fall to the ground in homage and blessing the king , Joab say , this day your servant know that I be in good favor with you , my lord king , since the king have grant the request of your servant .      Joab then go off to Geshur and bring Absalom to Jerusalem .      but the king say , let he go off to his own house ; he shall not appear before    I . so Absalom go off to his house and do not appear before the king .     in all Israel there be no man more praise for his beauty than Absalom , flawless from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head .      when he shave his head\xe2\x80\x94as he use to do at the end of every year , because his hair become too heavy for him\xe2\x80\x94the hair weigh two hundred shekel accord to the royal standard .      Absalom have three son bear to he , besides a daughter name Tamar , who be a beautiful woman .     Absalom be pardon .     Absalom live in Jerusalem for two year without appear before the king .      then he send a message ask Joab to send he to the king , but Joab would not come to he . although he ask he a second time , Joab would not come .      he therefore instruct his servant : you see Joabs field that border mine , where he have barley . go , set it on fire . and so Absaloms servant set the field on fire .    Joabs farmhand come to he with torn garment and tell he , Absaloms servant set your field on fire .      Joab go to Absalom in his house and ask he , why have your servant set my field on fire ?      Absalom answer Joab : I send you a message : come here , that I may send you to the king to say : why do I come back from Geshur ? I would be well off if I be still there ! now , let I appear before the king . if I be guilty , let he put I to death .      Joab go to the king and report this . the king then call Absalom ; he come to he and in homage fall on his face to the ground before the king . then the king kiss Absalom .             '
