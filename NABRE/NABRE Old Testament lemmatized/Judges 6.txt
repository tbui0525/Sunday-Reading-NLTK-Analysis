b '   the call of Gideon .     the Israelites do what be evil in the sight of the   Lord , who therefore deliver they into the power of midian for seven year ,      so that Midian hold Israel subject . from fear of Midian the Israelites make den in the mountain , the cave , and the stronghold .        for it use to be that whenever the Israelites have complete sow their crop , Midian , Amalek , and the Kedemites    would come up ,      encamp against they , and lie waste the produce of the land as far as the outskirt of Gaza , leave no sustenance in Israel , and no sheep , ox , or donkey .      for they would come up with their livestock , and their tent would appear as thick as locust . they would be too many to count when they come into the land to lay it waste .       Israel be reduce to utter poverty by Midian , and so the Israelites cry out to the   Lord .     when Israel cry out to the   Lord   because of Midian ,       the   Lord   send a prophet to the Israelites who say to they : thus say the   Lord , the God of Israel : I be the one who bring you up from Egypt ; I bring you out of the house of slavery .      I rescue you from the power of Egypt and all your oppressor . I drive they out before you and give you their land .      and I say to you : I , the   Lord , be your God ; you shall not fear the god of the Amorites in whose land you be dwell . but you do not listen to I .     then the messenger of the   Lord   come and sit under the terebinth in Ophrah that belong to Joash the Abiezrite . Joashs son Gideon    be beat out wheat in the wine press to save it from the Midianites ,      and the messenger of the   Lord   appear to he and say : the   Lord   be with you , you mighty warrior !      my lord , Gideon say to he , if the   Lord   be with we , why have all this happen to we ? where be his wondrous deed about which our ancestor tell we when they say , do not the   Lord   bring we up from Egypt ? for now the   Lord   have abandon we and have deliver we into the power of Midian .       the   Lord   turn to he and say : go with the strength you have , and save Israel from the power of Midian . be it not I who send you ?      but he answer he , please , my Lord , how can I save Israel ? my family be the poor in Manasseh , and I be the most insignificant in my father house .        the   Lord   say to he : I will be with you ,    and you will cut down Midian to the last man .      he answer he , if you look on I with favor , give I a sign that you be the one speak with I .      please do not depart from here until I come to you and bring out my offering and set it before you . he answer : I will await your return .     so Gideon go off and prepare a young goat and an ephah    of flour in the form of unleavened cake . put the meat in a basket and the broth in a pot , he bring they out to he under the terebinth and present they .       the messenger of God say to he : take the meat and unleavened cake and lie they on this rock ; then pour out the broth . when he have do so ,      the messenger of the   Lord   stretch out the tip of the staff he hold . when he touch the meat and unleavened cake , a fire come up from the rock and consume the meat and unleavened cake . then the messenger of the   Lord   disappear from sight .       Gideon , now aware that it have be the messenger of the   Lord , say , Alas , Lord   God , that I have see the messenger of the   Lord   face to face !        the   Lord   answer he : you be safe . do not fear . you shall not die .      so Gideon build there an altar to the   Lord   and call it Yahweh - shalom .     to this day it be still in Ophrah of the Abiezrites .     that same night the   Lord   say to he : take your father bull , the bull fatten for seven year , and pull down your father altar to Baal . as for the asherah    beside it , cut it down      and build an altar to the   Lord , your God , on top of this stronghold with the pile of wood . then take the fattened bull and offer it as a whole - burn sacrifice on the wood from the asherah you have cut down .      so Gideon take ten of his servant and do as the   Lord   have command he . but he be too afraid of his family and of the townspeople to do it by day ; he do it at night .      early the next morning the townspeople find that the altar of Baal have be dismantle , the asherah beside it cut down , and the fatten bull offer on the altar that be build .      they ask one another , who do this ? they inquire and search until they be tell , Gideon , son of Joash , do it .      so the townspeople say to Joash , bring out your son that he may die , for he have dismantle the altar of Baal and cut down the asherah that be beside it .      but Joash reply to all who be stand around he , be it for you to take action for Baal , or be his savior ? anyone who take action for he shall be put to death by morning . if he be a god , let he act for himself ,    since his altar have be dismantle !      so on that day Gideon be call Jerubbaal ,     because of the word , let Baal take action against he , since he dismantle his altar .     then all Midian and Amalek and the Kedemites muster and cross over into the valley of Jezreel , where they encamp .      and Gideon be clothe with the spirit of the   Lord ,     and he blow the horn summoning Abiezer to follow he .      he send messenger throughout Manasseh , and they , too , be summon to follow he ; he also send messenger throughout Asher , Zebulun , and Naphtali , and they advance to meet the other .      Gideon say to God , if indeed you be go to save Israel through I , as you have say ,      I be put this woolen fleece on the threshing floor , and if dew be on the fleece alone , while all the ground be dry , I shall know that you will save Israel through I , as you have say .      that be what happen . early the next morning when he wring out the fleece , he squeeze enough dew from it to fill a bowl .      Gideon then say to God , do not be angry with I if I speak once more . let I make just one more test with the fleece . let the fleece alone be dry , but let there be dew on all the ground .      that be what God do that night : the fleece alone be dry , but there be dew on all the ground .
