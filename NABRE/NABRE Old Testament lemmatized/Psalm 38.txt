b ' prayer of an afflict Sinner   a psalm of David . for remembrance .    I   Lord , do not punish I in your anger ;   in your wrath do not chastise I !    your arrow have sink deep in I ;    your hand have come down upon I .   there be no wholesomeness in my flesh because of your anger ;   there be no health in my bone because of my sin .    my iniquity overwhelm I ,   a burden too heavy for I .     II   Foul and fester be my sore   because of my folly .   I be stoop and deeply bow ;    every day I go about mourning .   my loin burn with fever ;   there be no wholesomeness in my flesh .   I be numb and utterly crush ;   I wail with anguish of heart .    my Lord , my deep yearning be before you ;   my groaning be not hide from you .   my heart shudder , my strength forsake I ;   the very light of my eye have fail .    friend and companion shun my disease ;   my neighbor stand far off .   those who seek my life lie snare for I ;   they seek my misfortune , they speak of ruin ;   they plot treachery every day .    III   but I be like the deaf , hear nothing ,   like the mute , I do not open my mouth ,   I be even like someone who do not hear ,   who have no answer ready .   Lord , it be for you that I wait ;   o Lord , my God , you respond .    for I have say that they would gloat over I ,   exult over I if I stumble .    IV   I be very near to fall ;   my wound be with I always .   I acknowledge my guilt   and grieve over my sin .    my enemy live and grow strong ,   those who hate I grow numerous fraudulently ,   repay I evil for good ,   accuse I for pursue good .    do not forsake I , o   Lord ;   my God , be not far from I !    come quickly to help I ,    my Lord and my salvation !
