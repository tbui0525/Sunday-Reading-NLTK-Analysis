b ' the Vanity of Life   for the leader , for Jeduthun .    a psalm of David .    I   I say , I will watch my way ,   lest I sin with my tongue ;   I will keep a muzzle on my mouth .   Mute and silent before the wicked ,   I refrain from good thing . but my sorrow increase ;    my heart smolder within I .   in my sigh a fire blaze up ,   and I break into speech :    II   Lord , let I know my end , the number of my day ,   that I may learn how frail I be .   to be sure , you establish the expanse of my day ;   indeed , my life be as nothing before you .   every man be but a breath .   Selah    III   Man go about as a mere phantom ;   they hurry about , although in vain ;   he heap up store without know for whom .   and now ,   Lord , for what do I wait ?   you be my only hope .   from all my sin deliver I ;   let I not be the taunt of fool .     I be silent and do not open my mouth   because you be the one who do this .   take your plague away from I ;   I be ravage by the touch of your hand .   you chastise man with rebuke for sin ;   like a moth you consume his treasure .   every man be but a breath . Selah   listen to my prayer ,   Lord , hear my cry ;   do not be deaf to my weeping ! for I be with you like a foreigner ,   a refugee , like my ancestor .    turn your gaze from I , that I may smile   before I depart to be no more .
