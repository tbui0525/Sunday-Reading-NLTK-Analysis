b ' sraels Confession of Sin   Hallelujah ! a give thank to the   Lord , who be good ,   whose mercy endure forever .    who can recount the mighty deed of the   Lord ,   proclaim in full Gods praise ?   bless those who do what be right ,   whose deed be always just .    remember I ,   Lord , as you favor your people ;   come to I with your saving help ,    that   may see the prosperity of your choose one ,   rejoice in the joy of your people ,   and glory with your heritage .    b   we have sin like our ancestor ;    we have do wrong and be guilty .      our ancestor in Egypt   do not attend to your wonder . they do not remember your manifold mercy ;   they defy the most high at the Red Sea .   yet he save they for his name sake   to make his power know .    he roar at the Red Sea and it dry up .   he lead they through the deep as through a desert .    he rescue they from hostile hand ,   free they from the power of the enemy .   the water cover their oppressor ;   not one of they survive .   then they believe his word   and sing his praise .       but they soon forget all he have do ;   they have no patience for his plan .   n the desert they give in to their craving ,   tempt God in the wasteland .    so he give they what they ask   and send a waste disease against they .       n the camp they challenge Moses    and Aaron , the holy one of the   Lord .   the earth open and swallow Dathan ,   it close on the follower of Abiram .   against their company the fire blaze ;   flame consume the wicked .    v   at Horeb they fashion a calf ,    worship a metal statue .   they exchange their glory    for the image of a grass - eat bull .   they forget the God who have save they ,   who have do great deed in Egypt ,    amazing deed in the land of Ham ,   fearsome deed at the Red Sea .   he would have decree their destruction ,   have not Moses , his choose one , Withstood he in the breach    to turn back his destroy anger .     v   Next they despise the beautiful land ;    they do not believe the promise .   n their tent they complain ;   they do not heed the voice of the   Lord .   so with raise hand he swear   he would destroy they in the desert ,   and scatter their descendant among the nation ,   disperse they in foreign land .    v   they join in the rite of Baal of Peor ,    eat food sacrifice to the dead .   they provoke he by their action ,   and a plague break out among they .   then Phinehas rise to intervene ,   and the plague be bring to a halt .   this be count for he as a righteous deed   for all generation to come .    v   at the water of Meribah they anger God ,    and Moses suffer because of they .    they so embitter his spirit   that rash word cross his lip .    v   they do not destroy the people   as the   Lord   have command they ,    but mingle with the nation   and imitate their way .    they serve their idol   and be ensnare by they .    they sacrifice to demon    their own son and daughter ,   shed innocent blood ,   the blood of their own son and daughter , whom they sacrifice to the idol of Canaan ,   desecrate the land with bloodshed .   they defile themselves by their action ,   become adulterer by their conduct .   so the   Lord   grow angry with his people ,   abhor his own heritage .   he hand they over to the nation ,   and their adversary rule over they .    their enemy oppress they ,   keep they under subjection .   many time do he rescue they ,   but they keep rebel and scheme   and be bring low by their own guilt .    still God have regard for their affliction   when he hear their wail .   for their sake he remember his covenant   and relent in his abundant mercy ,    win for they compassion   from all who hold they captive .    c   save we ,   Lord , our God ;   gather we from among the nation that we may give thank to your holy name   and glory in praise you .     bless be the   Lord , the God of srael ,   from everlaste to everlaste !   let all the people say , amen !   Hallelujah !             '
