Judith bow down to God . Judith and her Maid leave Bethulia .   then she say to they , order the gate of the city open for I , that I may go to accomplish the matter we discuss . so they order the young man to open the gate for she , as she have request ,      and they do so . then Judith and her maidservant go out . the man of the city keep she in view as she go down the mountain and cross the valley ; then they lose sight of she .     as Judith and her maid walk directly across the valley , they encounter the assyrian patrol .      the man take she in custody and ask she , to what people do you belong ? where do you come from , and where be you go ?    she reply : I be a daughter of the Hebrews , and I be flee from they , because they be about to be deliver up to you as prey .      I have come to see Holofernes , the rank general of your force , to give he a trustworthy report ; in his presence I will show he the way by which he can ascend and take possession of the whole hill country without a single one of his man suffer injury or loss of life .      when the man hear her word and gaze upon her face , which appear marvelously beautiful to they , they say to she ,      by hasten down to see our master , you have save your life . now go to his tent ; some of we will accompany you to hand you over to he .      when you stand before he , have no fear in your heart ; give he the report you have give we , and he will treat you well .      so they select a hundred of their man as an escort for she and her maid , and these conduct they to the tent of Holofernes .     as the news of her arrival spread among the tent , a crowd gather in the camp . they come and stand around she as she wait outside the tent of Holofernes , while he be be inform about she .      they marvel at her beauty , regard the Israelites with wonder because of she , and they say to one another , who can despise this people who have such woman among they ? it be not good to leave one of their man alive , for if any be to be spare they could beguile the whole earth .    Judith meet Holofernes .     then the guard of Holofernes and all his attendant come out and usher she into the tent .      Holofernes be recline on his bed under a canopy    weave of purple , gold , emerald , and other precious stone .      when they announce she to he , he come out to the front part of the tent , precede by silver lamp .      when Judith come before Holofernes and his attendant , they all marvel at the beauty of her face . she fall prostrate and pay homage to he , but his servant raise she up .
