b '    if you be choose to preside at a dinner , do not be puff up ,   but with the guest be as one of they ; take care of they first and then sit down ;    see to their need , and then take your place , to share in their joy   and receive a wreath for a job well do .   you who be old , it be your right to speak ,   but temper your knowledge and do not interrupt the singing .   where there be entertainment , do not pour out discourse ,   and do not display your wisdom at the wrong time .   like a seal of carnelian in a setting of gold :   a concert of music at a banquet of wine .   a seal of emerald in a work of gold :   the melody of music with delicious wine .   speak , young man , only when necessary ,    when they have ask you more than once .   be brief , say much in few word ;   be knowledgeable and yet quiet .   when among elder do not be forward ,   and with official do not be too insistent .   the lightning that flash before a hailstorm :   the esteem that shine on modesty .   leave in good time and do not be the last ;   go home quickly without delay .   there enjoy do as you wish ,   but do not sin through word of pride .   above all , bless your maker ,   who shower his favor upon you .    the Providence of God   whoever seek God must accept discipline ;    and whoever resort to he obtain an answer .    whoever seek the law will master it ,   but the hypocrite will be ensnare by it .    whoever fear the   Lord   will understand what be right ,   and out of obscurity he will draw forth a course of action .    the lawless turn aside warning   and distort the law to suit their purpose .      the sensible will not neglect direction ;   the proud and insolent be deter by no fear .   do nothing without deliberation ;   then once you have act , have no regret .    do not go on a way set with snare ,   and do not stumble on the same thing twice .   do not trust the road , because of bandit ;    be careful on your path .   whatever you do , be on your guard ,   for whoever do so keep the commandment .   whoever keep the law preserve himself ;   and whoever trust in the   Lord   shall not be put to shame .
