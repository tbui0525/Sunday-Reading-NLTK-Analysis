I will stretch out my hand against you and turn you into a desolate waste .        your city I will turn into ruin , and you shall be a desolation ; then you shall know that I be the   Lord .      because you nurse a long - stand hatred and hand the Israelites over to the sword at the time of their collapse , at the time of their final punishment ,         therefore , as I live\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the Lord   God \xe2\x80\x94you be guilty of blood , and blood , I swear , shall pursue you .

I will make you a desolation forever ,   your city will not be inhabit ,   and you shall know that I be the   Lord .      because you say : the two nation and the two land    belong to I ; let we take possession of them\xe2\x80\x94although the   Lord   be there\xe2\x80\x94      therefore , as I live\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the Lord   God \xe2\x80\x94i will deal with you accord to the anger and envy you deal out to they in your hatred , and I will make myself know to they when I execute judgment on you ,        then you shall know that I be the   Lord . I have hear all the insult you speak against the mountain of Israel , say : they be desolate ; they have be give to we to devour .      you boast against I with your mouth and use insolent word against I . I hear everything !      thus say the Lord   God : because you rejoice that the whole land be desolate , so I will do to you .      as you rejoice over the devastation of the heritage of the house of Israel , the same I will do to you : you will become a ruin , Mount Seir , and the whole of Edom , all of it ! then they shall know that I be the   Lord .
