b '    then I look and there above the firmament over the head of the cherubim be something like a sapphire , something that look like a throne .         and he say to the man dress in linen : go within the wheelwork under the cherubim ; fill both your hand with burn coal from the place among the cherubim , then scatter they over the city . as I watch , he enter .        now the cherubim be stand to the south of the temple when the man go in and a cloud fill the inner court .      the glory of the   Lord   have move off the cherubim to the threshold of the temple ; the temple be fill with the cloud , the whole court brilliant with the glory of the   Lord .      the sound of the wing of the cherubim could be hear as far as the outer court ; it be like the voice of God Almighty speak .        he command the man dress in linen : take fire from within the wheelwork among the cherubim . the man enter and stand by one of the wheel .      thereupon a cherub stretch out a hand from among the cherubim toward the fire in the midst of the cherubim , take some , and put it in the hand of the one dress in linen . he take it and come out .      something like a human hand be visible under the wing of the cherubim .      I also see four wheel beside the cherubim , one wheel beside each cherub , and the wheel appear to have the sparkle of yellow topaz .      and the appearance of the four all seem alike , as though one wheel be inside the other .      when they move , they go in any of the four direction without veer as they move ; in whatever direction the first cherub face , the other follow without veer as they go .      their entire bodies\xe2\x80\x94back , hand , and wings\xe2\x80\x94and wheel be cover with eye all around like the four wheel .        I hear the wheel call wheelwork .      each live creature have four face : the first a cherub , the second a human being , the third a lion , the fourth an eagle .         when the cherubim rise up , they be indeed the live creature I have see by the river Chebar .        when the cherubim move , the wheel go beside they ; when the cherubim lift up their wing to rise from the earth , even then the wheel do not leave their side .      when they stand still , the wheel stand still ; when they rise up , the wheel rise up with they , for the spirit of the living creature be in they .      then the glory of the   Lord   leave the threshold of the temple and take its place upon the cherubim .      the cherubim lift their wing and rise up from the earth before my eye as they depart with the wheel beside they . they stop at the entrance of the eastern gate of the   Lord s house , and the glory of the God of Israel be up above they .         these be the live creature I have see beneath the God of Israel by the river Chebar . now I know they be cherubim .        each of they have four face and four wing , and something like human hand under their wing .      their face look just like the face I have see by the river Chebar ; and each one go straight ahead .
