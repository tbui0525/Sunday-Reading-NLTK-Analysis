b '   Oracles concern the end of false prophecy .      on that day a fountain will be open for the house of David    and the inhabitant of Jerusalem , to purify from sin and uncleanness .      on that day\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord   of hosts\xe2\x80\x94I will destroy the name of the idol from the land , so that they will be mention no more ; I will also remove the prophet and the spirit of uncleanness from the land .      if any still prophesy , their father and mother who bear they will say , you will not live , because you have speak a lie in the name of the   Lord . their father and mother who bear they will thrust they through when they prophesy .      on that day , all prophet will be ashamed of the vision they prophesy ; and they will not put on the hairy mantle    to mislead ,        but each will say , I be not a prophet . I be a tiller of the soil , for I have own land since my youth .        and if anyone ask , what be these wound on your chest ?    each will answer , I receive these wound in the house of my friend .     the Song of the Sword   Awake , o sword , against my shepherd ,   against the one who be my associate   \xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord   of host . strike the shepherd   that the sheep may be scatter ;     I will turn my hand against the little one .   in all the land\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord \xe2\x80\x94   two third of they will be cut off and perish ,   and one third will be leave .   I will bring the one third through the fire ;   I will refine they as one refine silver ,    and I will test they as one test gold . they will call upon my name , and I will answer they ;    I will say , they be my people ,    and they will say , the   Lord   be my God .
