b ' praise God with Song and Sword   Hallelujah ! sing to the   Lord   a new song ,   his praise in the assembly of the faithful .    let Israel be glad in its maker ,   the people of Zion rejoice in their king .   let they praise his name in dance ,   make music with tambourine and lyre .     for the   Lord   take delight in his people ,   honor the poor with victory .   let the faithful rejoice in their glory ,   cry out for joy on their couch ,    with the praise of God in their mouth ,   and a two - edge sword in their hand ,    to bring retribution on the nation ,   punishment on the people ,    to bind their king in shackle ,   their noble in chain of iron ,   to execute the judgment decree for them\xe2\x80\x94   such be the glory    of all Gods faithful . Hallelujah !             '
