b '    Balaam , however , perceive that the   Lord   be pleased to bless Israel , do not go aside as before to seek omen , but turn his gaze toward the wilderness .      when Balaam look up and see Israel encamp , tribe by tribe , the spirit of God come upon he ,      and he recite his poem : the oracle of Balaam , son of Beor ,   the oracle of the man whose eye be true ,   the oracle of one who hear what God say ,   and know what the most High know , of one who see what the Almighty see ,   in rapture    and with eye unveil :   how pleasant be your tent , Jacob ;   your encampment , Israel !   like palm tree spread out ,   like garden beside a river , like aloe the   Lord   plant ,   like cedar beside water ;   Water will drip from their bucket ,   their seed will have plentiful water ; their king will rise higher than Agag    and their dominion will be exalt .   they have the like of a wild ox horn :   God who bring they out of Egypt . they will devour hostile nation ,   break their bone , and crush their loin .    crouch , they lie like a lion ,   or like a lioness ; who will arouse they ? bless be those who bless you ,   and curse be those who curse you !      in a blaze of anger at Balaam , Balak clap his hand    and say to he , it be to lay a curse on my foe that I summon you here ; yet three time now you have actually bless they !        now flee to your home . I promise to reward you richly , but the   Lord   have withhold the reward from you !      Balaam reply to Balak , do I not even tell the messenger whom you send to I ,      even if Balak give I his house full of silver and gold , I could not of my own accord do anything , good or evil , contrary to the command of the   Lord ? whatever the   Lord   say I must say .     the Fourth Oracle .     but now that I be about to go to my own people , let I warn you what this people will do to your people in the day to come .      then he recite his poem : the oracle of Balaam , son of Beor ,   the oracle of the man whose eye be true ,   the oracle of one who hear what God say ,   and know what the most High know , of one who see what the Almighty see ,   in rapture and with eye unveil .   I see he , though not now ;   I observe he , though not near : a star shall advance from Jacob ,   and a scepter    shall rise from Israel , that will crush the brow of Moab ,    and the skull of all the Sethites ,   Edom will be dispossess ,   and no survivor be leave in Seir . Israel will act boldly ,    and Jacob will rule his foe .     upon see Amalek , Balaam recite his poem : First    of the nation be Amalek ,   but their end be to perish forever .      upon see the Kenites ,    he recite his poem : though your dwelling be safe ,   and your nest be set on a cliff ;   yet Kain will be destroy   when Asshur    take you captive .     upon see    [ the Ishmaelites ? ] he recite his poem : Alas , who shall survive of Ishmael ,    to deliver they from the hand of the Kittim ? when they have conquer Asshur and conquer Eber , they too shall perish forever .     then Balaam set out on his journey home ; and Balak also go his way .
