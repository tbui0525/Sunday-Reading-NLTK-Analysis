b '   Fourth example : Darkness Afflicts the Egyptians , while the Israelites have Light    for great be your judgment , and hard to describe ;   therefore the unruly soul go astray .    for when the lawless thought to enslave the holy nation ,   they themselves lie shackle with darkness , fetter by the long night ,   confine beneath their own roof as exile from the eternal providence .    for they , who suppose their secret sin be hide    under the dark veil of oblivion , be scatter in fearful trembling ,   terrify by apparition .   for not even their inner chamber keep they unafraid ,   for crash sound on all side terrify they ,   and mute phantom with somber look appear .   no fire have force enough to give light ,   nor do the flame brilliance of the star   succeed in light up that gloomy night .    but only intermittent , fearful fire   flash through upon they ; and in their terror they think behold these be bad   than the time when that sight be no long to be see .    and mockery of their magic art    fail ,   and there be a humiliating refutation of their vaunted shrewdness .    for they who undertake to banish fear and terror from the sick soul   themselves sicken with ridiculous fear .   for even though no monstrous thing frighten they ,   they shake at the passing of insect and the hissing of reptile ,    and perish tremble ,   reluctant to face even the air that they could nowhere escape .   for wickedness , of its nature cowardly , testify in its own condemnation ,   and because of a distressed conscience , always magnify misfortune .    for fear be nought but the surrender of the help that come from reason ;    and the more one expectation be of itself uncertain ,   the more one make of not know the cause that bring on torment .   so they , during that night , powerless though it be ,   since it have come upon they from the recess of a powerless    Hades ,   while all sleep the same sleep ,   be partly smite by fearsome apparition   and partly stricken by their soul surrender ;   for fear overwhelm they , sudden and unexpected .    thus , then , whoever be there fall   into that prison without bar and be keep confine .    for whether one be a farmer , or a shepherd ,   or a worker at task in the wasteland , take unaware , each serve out the inescapable sentence ;    for all be bind by the one bond of darkness .   and be it only the whistle wind ,   or the melodious song of bird in the spread branch , or the steady sound of rush water ,    or the rude crash of overthrown rock , or the unseen gallop of bound animal ,   or the roar cry of the fierce beast , or an echo resound from the hollow of the hills\xe2\x80\x94   these sound , inspire terror , paralyze they .   for the whole world shine with brilliant light    and continue its work without interruption ;   but over they alone be spread oppressive night ,   an image of the darkness    that be about to come upon they .   yet they be more a burden to themselves than be the darkness .
