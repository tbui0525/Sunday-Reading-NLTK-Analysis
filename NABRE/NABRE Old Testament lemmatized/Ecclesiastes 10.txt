b '    dead fly corrupt and spoil the perfumer oil ;   more weighty than wisdom or wealth be a little folly !    the wise heart turn to the right ;   the foolish heart to the left .      even when walk in the street the fool , lack understanding , call everyone a fool .      should the anger of a ruler burst upon you , do not yield your place ; for calmness    abate great offense .     I have see under the sun another evil , like a mistake that proceed from a tyrant :      a fool put in high position , while the great and the rich sit in lowly place .      I have see slave on horseback , while prince    go on foot like slave .     whoever dig a pit may fall into it ,    and whoever break through a wall , a snake may bite .   whoever quarry stone may be hurt by they ,   and whoever chop wood    be in danger from it .     if the ax become dull , and the blade be not sharpen , then effort must be increase . but the advantage of wisdom be success .     if the snake bite before it be charm ,   then there be no advantage in a charmer .    word from the mouth of the wise win favor ,   but the lip of fool consume they .    the beginning of their word be folly ,   and the end of their talk be utter madness ;    yet fool multiply word . no one know what be to come ,   for who can tell anyone what will be ?    the toil of fool weary they ,   so they do not know even the way to town .    no one know what evil will come   Woe to you , o land , whose king be a youth ,    and whose prince feast in the morning !   happy be you , o land , whose king be of noble birth ,   and whose prince dine at the right time\xe2\x80\x94   for vigor    and not in drinking bout .   because of laziness , the rafter sag ;   when hand be slack , the house leak .   a feast be make for merriment   and wine give joy to the living ,   but money answer    for everything .   even in your thought do not curse the king ,   nor in the privacy of your bedroom curse the rich ; for the bird of the air may carry your voice ,   a winged creature    may tell what you say .
