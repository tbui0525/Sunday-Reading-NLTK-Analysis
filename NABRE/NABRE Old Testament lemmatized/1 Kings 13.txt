b '    a man of God come from Judah to Bethel by the word of the   Lord , while Jeroboam be stand at the altar to burn incense .       he cry out against the altar by the word of the   Lord : Altar , altar , thus say the   Lord : a child shall be bear to the house of David , Josiah by name , who shall slaughter upon you the priest of the high place who burn incense upon you , and they shall burn human bone upon you .       he also give a sign that same day and say : this be the sign that the   Lord   have speak : the altar shall be tear apart and the ashe on it shall be scatter .      when the king hear the word of the man of God which he be cry out against the altar in Bethel , Jeroboam stretch forth his hand from the altar and say , seize he ! but the hand he stretch forth against he wither , so that he could not draw it back .      ( the altar be tear apart and the ashe from the altar be scatter , in accordance with the sign the man of God give by the word of the   Lord . )     then the king say to the man of God , entreat the   Lord , your God , and intercede for I that my hand may be restore . so the man of God entreat the   Lord , and the king hand be restore as it be before .      the king tell the man of God , come with I to the house for some refreshment so that I may give you a present .      the man of God say to the king , if you give I half your palace , I would not go with you , nor eat bread or drink water in this place .      for I be instruct by the word of the   Lord : do not eat bread or drink water , and do not return by the way you come .      so he depart by another road and do not go back the way he have come to Bethel . prophetic Disunity .        there be an old prophet live in Bethel , whose son come and tell he all that the man of God have do that day in Bethel . when his son repeat to their father the word the man of God have speak to the king ,      the father ask they , which way do he go ? so his son point out to he the road take by the man of God who have come from Judah .      then he say to his son , saddle the donkey for I . when they have saddle it , he mount      and follow the man of God , whom he find seat under a terebinth . when he ask he , be you the man of God who come from Judah ? he answer , yes .      then he say , come home with I and have some bread .      I can not return with you or go with you , and I can not eat bread or drink water with you in this place , he answer ,      for I be tell by the word of the   Lord : you shall not eat bread or drink water there , and do not go back the way you come .      but he say to he , I , too , be a prophet like you , and an angel tell I by the word of the   Lord : bring he back with you to your house to eat bread and drink water . but he be lie to he .      so he go back with he , and eat bread and drink water in his house .      but while they be sit at table , the word of the   Lord   come to the prophet who have bring he back ,      and he cry out to the man of God who have come from Judah : thus say the   Lord : because you rebel against the charge of the   Lord   and do not keep the command which the   Lord , your God , give you ,      but return and eat bread and drink water in the place where he tell you , do not eat bread or drink water , your corpse shall not be bring to the grave of your ancestor .      after he have eat bread and drunk , they saddle for he the donkey that belong to the prophet who have bring he back ,      and he set out . but a lion meet he on the road , and kill he . his body lie sprawl on the road , and the donkey remained stand by it , and so do the lion .     some passersby see the body lie in the road , with the lion stand beside it , and carry the news to the city where the old prophet live .      on hear it , the prophet who have bring he back from his journey say : it be the man of God who rebel against the charge of the   Lord . the   Lord   have deliver he to a lion , which mangle and kill he , accord to the word which the   Lord   have speak to he .      then he say to his son , saddle the donkey for I , and they saddle it .      he go off and find the body sprawl on the road with the donkey and the lion stand beside it . the lion have not eat the body nor have it harm the donkey .      the prophet lift up the body of the man of God and put it on the donkey , and bring he back to the city to mourn and to bury he .      he lay the mans body in his own grave , and they mourn over it : alas , my brother !       after he have bury he , he say to his son , when I die , bury I in the grave where the man of God be bury . lay my bone beside his .       for the word which he proclaim by the word of the   Lord   against the altar in Bethel and against all the temple on the high place in the city of Samaria shall certainly come to pass .     even after this , Jeroboam do not turn from his evil way , but again make priest for the high place from among the common people . whoever desire it be instal as a priest of the high place .      this be the account of the sin of the house of Jeroboam for which it be to be cut off and destroy from the face of the earth .
