b ' prayer for help   for the leader . a psalm of David .    I   how long ,   Lord ? will you utterly forget I ?   how long will you hide your face from I ?    how long must I carry sorrow in my soul ,   grief in my heart day after day ?   how long will my enemy triumph over I ?    II   look upon I , answer I ,   Lord , my God !   give light to my eye lest I sleep in death ,   lest my enemy say , I have prevail ,   lest my foe rejoice at my downfall .     III   but I trust in your mercy .   Grant my heart joy in your salvation , I will sing to the   Lord ,   for he have deal bountifully with I !              '
