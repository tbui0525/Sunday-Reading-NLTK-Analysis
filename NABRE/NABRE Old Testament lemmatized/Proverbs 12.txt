b '    whoever love discipline love knowledge ,   but whoever hate reproof be stupid .     a good person win favor from the   Lord ,   but the schemer he condemn .    no one be make secure by wickedness ,   but the root of the just will never be disturb .    a woman of worth be the crown of her husband ,    but a disgraceful one be like rot in his bone .    the plan of the just be right ;   the design of the wicked be deceit .    the word of the wicked be a deadly ambush ,   but the speech of the upright save they .    overthrow the wicked and they be no more ,   but the house of the just stand firm .   for their good sense people be praise ,   but the perverse of heart be despise .    well to be slight and have a servant   than put on air and lack bread .    the just take care of their livestock ,   but the compassion of the wicked be cruel .    those who till their own land have food in plenty ,   but those who engage in idle pursuit lack sense .     a wicked person desire the catch of evil people ,   but the root of the righteous will bear fruit .    by the sin of their lip the wicked be ensnare ,   but the just escape from a tight spot .   from the fruit of their mouth people have their fill of good ,    and the work of their hand come back upon they .    the way of fool be right in their own eye ,   but those who listen to advice be the wise .   fool immediately show their anger ,   but the shrewd conceal contempt .   whoever speak honestly testify truly ,   but the deceitful make lie witness .     the babble of some people be like sword thrust ,   but the tongue of the wise be heal .   truthful lip endure forever ,   the lie tongue , for only a moment .    Deceit be in the heart of those who plot evil ,   but those who counsel peace have joy .   no harm befall the just ,   but the wicked be overwhelmed with misfortune .   lie lip be an abomination to the   Lord ,    but those who be truthful , his delight .   the shrewd conceal knowledge ,   but the heart of fool proclaim folly .    the diligent hand will govern ,   but sloth make for forced labor .    worry weigh down the heart ,   but a kind word give it joy .    the just act as guide to their neighbor ,   but the way of the wicked lead they astray .   Sloth do not catch its prey ,   but the wealth of the diligent be splendid .   in the path of justice be life ,   but the way of abomination lead to death .             '
