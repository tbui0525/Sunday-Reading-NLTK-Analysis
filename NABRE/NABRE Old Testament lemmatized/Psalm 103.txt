II   the   Lord   do righteous deed ,   bring justice to all the oppressed .    he make know his way to Moses ,   to the Israelites his deed .   merciful and gracious be the   Lord ,   slow to anger , abound in mercy .    he will not always accuse ,   and nurse no last anger ;   he have not deal with we as our sin merit ,   nor requite we as our wrong deserve .
