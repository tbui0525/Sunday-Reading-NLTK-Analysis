b ' Samuels Integrity .      Samuel address all Israel : I have grant your request in every respect , he say . I have set a king over you        and now the king will lead you . as for I , I be old and gray , and my son be among you . I be your leader from my youth to the present day .      here I stand ! answer I in the presence of the   Lord   and the   Lord s anoint . whose ox have I take ? whose donkey have I take ? whom have I cheat ? whom have I wrong ? from whom have I accept a bribe and shut my eye because of it ? I will make restitution to you .        they reply , you have neither cheat we , nor oppress we , nor accept anything from anyone .      so he say to they , the   Lord   be witness against you this day , and the   Lord s anoint be witness , that you have find nothing in my possession . the   Lord   be witness , they say .    Samuel Admonishes the People .     Samuel continue : the   Lord   be witness , who appoint Moses and Aaron and bring your ancestor up from the land of Egypt .        now take your stand , that I may judge you in the presence of the   Lord   accord to all the gracious act that the   Lord   have do for you and your ancestor .      when Jacob and his son go to Egypt and the Egyptians oppress they , your ancestor cry out to the   Lord . the   Lord   then send Moses and Aaron to bring they out of Egypt and settle they in this place .        but they forget the   Lord   their God ; and so the   Lord   sell they into the power of Sisera , the captain of the army of Hazor , the power of the Philistines , and the power of the king of Moab , who make war against they .        they cry out to the   Lord   and say , we have sin because we abandon the   Lord   and serve the Baals and Astartes . now deliver we from the power of our enemy , and we will serve you .        the   Lord   send Jerubbaal , Barak , Jephthah , and Samuel ; he deliver you from the power of your enemy on every side , so that you could live in security .        yet , when you see Nahash , king of the Ammonites , advance against you , you say to I , no ! a king must rule we , even though the   Lord   your God be your king .     warning for People and king .     now here be the king you choose . see ! the   Lord   have give you a king .        if you fear and serve the   Lord , if you listen to the voice of the   Lord   and do not rebel against the   Lord s command , if both you and the king , who rule over you , follow the   Lord   your god\xe2\x80\x94well and good .      but if you do not listen to the voice of the   Lord   and if you rebel against the   Lord s command , the hand of the   Lord   will be against you and your king .      now then , stand ready to witness the great marvel the   Lord   be about to accomplish before your eye .      be we not in the harvest time for wheat ?    yet I will call upon the   Lord , and he will send thunder and rain . thus you will see and understand how great an evil it be in the eye of the   Lord   that you have ask for a king .        Samuel call upon the   Lord , and the   Lord   send thunder and rain that day . assistance promise .   then all the people fear the   Lord   and Samuel .      they say to Samuel , pray to the   Lord   your God for we , your servant , that we may not die for having add to all our other sin the evil of ask for a king .      do not fear , Samuel answer they . you have indeed commit all this evil ! yet do not turn from the   Lord , but serve he with your whole heart .      do not turn aside to god who be nothing ,    who can not act and deliver . they be nothing .        for the sake of his own great name    the   Lord   will not abandon his people , since the   Lord   have decide to make you his people .        as for I , far be it from I to sin against the   Lord   by cease to pray for you and to teach you the good and right way .        but you must fear the   Lord   and serve he faithfully with all your heart , for you have see the great thing the   Lord   have do among you .      if instead you continue to do evil , both you and your king shall be sweep away .
