b '   Isaac and Abimelech .       there be a famine in the land , distinct from the early one that have occur in the day of Abraham , and Isaac go down to Abimelech , king of the Philistines in Gerar .        the   Lord   appear to he and say : do not go down to Egypt , but camp in this land wherever I tell you .      Sojourn in this land , and I will be with you and bless you ; for to you and your descendant I will give all these land , in fulfillment of the oath that I swear to your father Abraham .        I will make your descendant as numerous as the star in the sky , and I will give they all these land , and in your descendant all the nation of the earth will find blessing\xe2\x80\x94        this because Abraham obey I , keep my mandate , my commandment , my ordinance , and my instruction .      so Isaac settle in Gerar .      when the man of the place ask question about his wife , he answer , she be my sister . he be afraid that , if he call she his wife , the man of the place would kill he on account of Rebekah , since she be beautiful .      but when they have be there for a long time , Abimelech , king of the Philistines , look out of a window and see Isaac fondle his wife Rebekah .      he call for Isaac and say : she must certainly be your wife ! how could you have say , she be my sister ? Isaac reply , I think I might lose my life on her account .      how could you have do this to we ! exclaim Abimelech . it would have take very little for one of the people to lie with your wife , and so you would have bring guilt upon we !      Abimelech then command all the people : anyone who maltreat this man or his wife shall be put to death .      Isaac sow a crop in that region and reap a hundredfold the same year . since the   Lord   bless he ,       he become rich and rich all the time , until he be very wealthy .      he acquire flock and herd , and a great work force , and so the Philistines become envious of he .       the Philistines have stop up and fill with dirt all the well that his father servant have dig back in the day of his father Abraham .      so Abimelech say to Isaac , go away from we ; you have become far too numerous for we .      Isaac leave there and camp in the Wadi Gerar where he stay .      Isaac reopen the well which his father servant have dig back in the day of his father Abraham and which the Philistines have stop up after Abrahams death ; he give they name like those that his father have give they .      but when Isaacs servant dig in the wadi and reach spring water in their well ,      the shepherd of Gerar argue with Isaacs shepherds , say , the water belong to we ! so he name the well Esek ,    because they have quarrel there .      then they dig another well , and they argue over that one too ; so he name it Sitnah .        so he move on from there and dig still another well , but over this one they do not argue . he name it Rehoboth ,    and say , because the   Lord   have now give we ample room , we shall flourish in the land .     from there Isaac go up to Beer - sheba .      the same night the   Lord   appear to he and say : I be the God of Abraham , your father . do not fear , for I be with you . I will bless you and multiply your descendant for the sake of Abraham , my servant .        so Isaac build an altar there and invoke the   Lord   by name . after he have pitch his tent there , Isaacs servant begin to dig a well nearby .      then Abimelech come to he from Gerar , with Ahuzzath , his councilor , and Phicol , the general of his army .      Isaac ask they , why have you come to I , since you hate I and have drive I away from you ?      they answer : we clearly see that the   Lord   have be with you , so we think : let there be a swear agreement between our two sides\xe2\x80\x94between you and we . let we make a covenant with you :      you shall do no harm to we , just as we have not maltreat you , but have always act kindly toward you and have let you depart in peace . so now , may you be bless by the   Lord !      Isaac then make a feast for they , and they eat and drink .      early the next morning they exchange oath . then Isaac send they on their way , and they depart from he in peace .     that same day Isaacs servant come and inform he about the well they have be dig ; they tell he , we have reach water !      he call it Shibah ;    hence the name of the city be Beer - sheba to this day .       when Esau be forty year old , he marry Judith , daughter of Beeri the Hittite , and Basemath , daughter of Elon the Hivite .        but they become a source of bitterness to Isaac and Rebekah .
