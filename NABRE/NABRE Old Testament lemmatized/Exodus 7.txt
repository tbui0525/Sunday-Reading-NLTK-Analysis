b '    the   Lord   answer Moses : see ! I have make you a god to Pharaoh ,    and Aaron your brother will be your prophet .        you will speak all that I command you . in turn , your brother Aaron will tell Pharaoh to let the Israelites go out of his land .      yet I will make Pharaoh so headstrong that , despite the many sign and wonder that I work in the land of Egypt ,      Pharaoh will not listen to you . therefore I will lay my hand on Egypt and with mighty act of judgment I will bring my army , my people the Israelites , out of the land of Egypt .      all Egyptians will know that I be the   Lord , when I stretch out my hand against Egypt and bring the Israelites out of their midst .     this , then , be what Moses and Aaron do . they do exactly as the   Lord   have command they .      Moses be eighty year old , and Aaron eighty - three , when they speak to Pharaoh .     the Staff turn into a serpent .     the   Lord   speak to Moses and Aaron :      when Pharaoh demand of you , produce a sign or wonder , you will say to Aaron : take your staff and throw it down before Pharaoh , and it will turn into a serpent .        then Moses and Aaron go to Pharaoh and do just as the   Lord   have command . Aaron throw his staff down before Pharaoh and his servant , and it turn into a serpent .      Pharaoh , in turn , summon the wise man and the sorcerer , and they also , the magician    of Egypt , do the same thing by their magic art .      each one throw down his staff , and they turn into serpent . but Aarons staff swallow their staff .      Pharaoh , however , harden his heart and would not listen to they , just as the   Lord   have foretell . first plague : water turn into blood .        then the   Lord   say to Moses : Pharaoh be obstinate    in refuse to let the people go .      in the morning , just when he set out for the water , go to Pharaoh and present yourself by the bank of the Nile , hold in your hand the staff that turn into a snake .        say to he : the   Lord , the God of the Hebrews , send I to you with the message : let my people go to serve I in the wilderness . but as yet you have not listen .      thus say the   Lord : this be how you will know that I be the   Lord . with the staff here in my hand , I will strike the water in the Nile and it will be change into blood .        the fish in the Nile will die , and the Nile itself will stink so that the Egyptians will be unable to drink water from the Nile .     the   Lord   then speak to Moses : speak to Aaron : take your staff and stretch out your hand over the water of egypt\xe2\x80\x94it stream , its canal , its pond , and all its supply of water\xe2\x80\x94that they may become blood . there will be blood throughout the land of Egypt , even in the wooden pail and stone jar .     this , then , be what Moses and Aaron do , exactly as the   Lord   have command . Aaron raise his staff and strike the water in the Nile in full view of Pharaoh and his servant , and all the water in the Nile be change into blood .      the fish in the Nile die , and the Nile itself stank so that the Egyptians could not drink water from it . there be blood throughout the land of Egypt .      but the egyptian magician do the same    by their magic art . so Pharaoh harden his heart and would not listen to they , just as the   Lord   have say .      Pharaoh turn away and go into his house , with no concern even for this .      all the Egyptians have to dig round about the Nile for drinking water , since they could not drink any water from the Nile .    second plague : the Frogs .     seven day pass after the   Lord   have strike the Nile .      then the   Lord   say to Moses : go to Pharaoh and tell he :    thus say the   Lord : let my people go to serve I .      if you refuse to let they go , then I will send a plague of frog over all your territory .      the Nile will teem with frog . they will come up and enter into your palace and into your bedroom and onto your bed , into the house of your servant , too , and among your people , even into your oven and your kneading bowl .      the frog will come up over you and your people and all your servant .
