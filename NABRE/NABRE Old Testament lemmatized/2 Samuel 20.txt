b '   Shebas Rebellion .     now a scoundrel name Sheba , the son of Bichri , a Benjaminite , happen to be there . he sound the horn and cry out , we have no share in David ,   nor any heritage in the son of Jesse .   everyone to your tent , o Israel !      so all the Israelites leave David to follow Sheba , son of Bichri . but the Judahites , from the Jordan to Jerusalem , remain loyal to their king .      David come to his house in Jerusalem , and the king take the ten concubine whom he have leave behind to care for the palace and place they under guard . he provide for they , but never again see they . and so they remain shut away to the day of their death , lifelong widow .     Amasas Death .     then the king say to Amasa : summon the Judahites for I within three day . then present yourself here .        accordingly Amasa set out to summon Judah , but delay beyond the time set for he .      then David say to Abishai : Sheba , son of Bichri , may now do we more harm than Absalom do . take your lord servant and pursue he , lest he find fortified city and take shelter while we look on .      so Joab and the Cherethites and Pelethites and all the warrior march out behind Abishai from Jerusalem to campaign in pursuit of Sheba , son of Bichri .         they be at the great stone in Gibeon when Amasa meet they . now Joab have a belt over his tunic , from which be sling a sword in its sheath at his thigh ; the sword would slide out downwards .        Joab ask Amasa , be everything all right , my brother ? and with his right hand hold Amasas beard as if to kiss he .      and since Amasa be not on his guard against the sword in Joabs other hand , Joab stab he in the abdomen with it , so that his entrail burst forth to the ground , and he die ; there be no second thrust . then Joab and Abishai his brother pursue Sheba , son of Bichri .        one of Joabs attendant stand by Amasa and say , let he who favor Joab and be for David follow Joab .      Amasa lie cover with blood in the middle of the highroad , and the man notice that all the soldier be stop . so he roll Amasa away from the road to the field and spread a garment over he , because he see how all who come upon he be stop .      when he have be remove from the road , everyone go on after Joab in pursuit of Sheba , son of Bichri .
