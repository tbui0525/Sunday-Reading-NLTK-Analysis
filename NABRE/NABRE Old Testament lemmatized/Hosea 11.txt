b '   the disappointment of a Parent    when Israel be a child I love he ,    out of Egypt    I call my son .    the more I call they ,   the far they go from I , sacrifice to the baal   and burn incense to idol .   yet it be I who teach Ephraim to walk ,   who take they in my arm ;    but they do not know that I care for they .   I draw they with human cord ,   with band of love ;   I foster they like those   who raise an infant to their cheek ;   I bend down to feed they .      he shall return to the land of Egypt ,    Assyria shall be his king ,   because they have refuse to repent .   the sword shall rage in his city :   it shall destroy his diviner ,   and devour they because of their scheming .   my people have their mind set on apostasy ;   though they call on God in unison ,   he shall not raise they up .    but love be strong and Restores   how could I give you up , Ephraim ,   or deliver you up , Israel ? how could I treat you as Admah ,   or make you like Zeboiim ?    my heart be overwhelmed ,   my pity be stir .   I will not give vent to my blaze anger ,   I will not destroy Ephraim again ; for I be God and not a man ,    the Holy One present among you ;   I will not come in wrath .   they shall follow the   Lord ,   who roar like a lion ;   when he roar ,   his child shall come frightened from the west ,   out of Egypt they shall come tremble , like bird ,   like dove , from the land of Assyria ; and I will resettle they in their home ,   oracle of the   Lord .
