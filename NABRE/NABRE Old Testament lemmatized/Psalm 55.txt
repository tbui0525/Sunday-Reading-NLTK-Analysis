b ' A Lament over Betrayal   for the leader . on stringed instrument . a   maskil   of David .    I   listen , God , to my prayer ;    do not hide from my pleading ;    hear I and give answer . I rock with grief ; I groan    at the uproar of the enemy ,   the clamor of the wicked . they heap trouble upon I ,   savagely accuse I .   my heart pound within I ;   death terror fall upon I .   fear and tremble overwhelm I ;   shudder sweep over I .   I say , if only I have wing like a dove   that I might fly away and find rest .    far away I would flee ;   I would stay in the desert .   Selah   I would soon find a shelter   from the rage wind and storm .    II   Lord , check and confuse their tongue .   for I see violence and strife in the city    make round on its wall day and night . within be mischief and trouble ;    treachery be in its midst ;   oppression and fraud never leave its street .    for it be not an enemy that revile me\xe2\x80\x94   that I could bear\xe2\x80\x94 not a foe who view I with contempt ,   from that I could hide .   but it be you , my other self ,   my comrade and friend ,    you , whose company I enjoy ,   at whose side I walk   in the house of God .    III   let death take they ;   let they go down alive to Sheol ,    for evil be in their home and belly .   but I will call upon God ,   and the   Lord   will save I .   at dusk , dawn , and noon   I will grieve and complain ,   and my prayer will be hear .    he will redeem my soul in peace   from those who war against I ,   though there be many who oppose I .   God , who sits enthrone forever ,    will hear I and afflict they . Selah for they will not mend their way ;   they have no fear of God .   he stretch out his hand at his friend   and break his covenant .   soft than butter be his speech ,   but war be in his heart . smooth than oil be his word ,   but they be unsheathe sword .    cast your care upon the   Lord ,   who will give you support . he will never allow   the righteous to stumble .    but you , God , will bring they down   to the pit of destruction .   these bloodthirsty liar   will not live half their day ,   but I put my trust in you .
