Elisha the prophet call one of the guild prophet and say to he : get ready for a journey . take this flask of oil with you , and go to Ramoth - gilead .      when you get there , look for Jehu , son of Jehoshaphat , son of Nimshi . enter and take he away from his companion and bring he into an inner chamber .      from the flask you have , pour oil on his head , and say , thus say the   Lord : I anoint you king over Israel . then open the door and flee without delay .     the aide ( the prophet aide ) go to Ramoth - gilead .      when he arrive , the commander of the army be in session . he say , I have a message for you , commander . Jehu ask , for which one of we ? for you , commander , he answer .      Jehu get up and go into the house . then the prophet aide pour the oil on his head and say , thus say the   Lord , the God of Israel : I anoint you king over the people of the   Lord , over Israel .       you shall destroy the house of Ahab your master ; thus will I avenge the blood of my servant the prophet , and the blood of all the other servant of the   Lord   shed by Jezebel .       the whole house of Ahab shall perish : I will cut off from Ahabs line every male ,   whether bond or free in Israel .     I will make the house of Ahab like that of Jeroboam , son of Nebat , and like that of Baasha , son of Ahijah .      in the confine of Jezreel , the dog shall devour Jezebel so that no one can bury she . then he open the door and flee .     when Jehu rejoin his master servant , they ask he , be all well ? why do that madman come to you ? he reply , you know that kind of man and his talk .      but they say , tell we another lie ! so he tell they , this be what the prophet aide say to I , thus say the   Lord : I anoint you king over Israel .      at once each take his garment , spread it under Jehu on the bare step , blow the horn , and cry out , Jehu be king !    death of Joram of Israel .      Jehu , son of Jehoshaphat , son of Nimshi , form a conspiracy against Joram . ( Joram , with all Israel , have be besiege Ramoth - gilead against Hazael , king of Aram ,      but have return to Jezreel to be heal of the wound the Arameans have inflict on he in the battle against Hazael , king of Aram . ) Jehu say to they , if this be what you really want , see that no one escape from the city to report in Jezreel .     then Jehu mount his chariot and drive to Jezreel , where Joram lie ill and Ahaziah , king of Judah , have come to visit he .      the watchman stand on the tower in Jezreel see the troop of Jehu come and report , I see chariot . Joram say , get a driver and send he to meet they and to ask whether all be well .      so a horseman go out to meet he and say , the king ask , be everything all right ? Jehu say , what do it matter to you how thing be ? get behind I . the watchman report to the king , the messenger have reach they , but be not return .      Joram send a second horseman , who go to they and say , the king ask , be everything all right ? what do it matter to you how thing be ? Jehu reply . get behind I .      the watchman report , he have reach they , but be not return . the driving be like that of Jehu , son of Nimshi ; he drive like a madman .       Hitch up my chariot , say Joram , and they hitch up his chariot . then Joram , king of Israel , and Ahaziah , king of Judah , set out , each in his own chariot , to meet Jehu . they reach he near the plot of ground of Naboth the Jezreelite .     when Joram recognize Jehu , he ask , be everything all right , Jehu ? Jehu reply , how could everything be all right as long as all the harlotry and sorcery    of your mother Jezebel continue ?      Joram rein about and flee , cry to Ahaziah , Treason , Ahaziah !      but Jehu have draw his bow and he shoot Joram between the shoulder , so that the arrow go through his heart and he collapse in his chariot .      then Jehu say to his adjutant Bidkar , take he and throw he into the plot of ground in the field of Naboth the Jezreelite . for remember when you and I be drive team behind Ahab his father , the   Lord   deliver this oracle against he :      as surely as I see yesterday the blood of Naboth and the blood of his sons\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord \xe2\x80\x94i will repay you for it in that very plot of ground\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord . so now take he and throw he into this plot of ground , in keep with the word of the   Lord .    death of Ahaziah of Judah .      see what be happen , Ahaziah , king of Judah , flee toward Beth - haggan . Jehu pursue he , shout , he too ! they strike he as he ride through the pass of Gur near Ibleam , but he continue his flight as far as Megiddo and die there .      his servant bring he in a chariot to Jerusalem and they bury he in his grave with his ancestor in the City of David .      in the eleventh year of Joram , son of Ahab , Ahaziah become king over Judah .    Death of Jezebel .     Jehu come to Jezreel , and when Jezebel hear of it , she shadow her eye , adorn her hair , and look down from her window .      as Jehu come through the gate , she cry out , be all well , you Zimri , murderer of your master ?        Jehu look up to the window and shout , who be on my side ? who ? at this , two or three eunuch look down toward he .      throw she down , he order . they throw she down , and some of her blood spurt against the wall and against the horse . Jehu trod over her body      and , after eat and drink , he say : attend to that accursed woman and bury she ; for she be the daughter of a king .      but when they go to bury she , they find nothing of she but the skull , the foot , and the hand .      they return to Jehu , and when they tell he , he say , this be the word the   Lord   speak through his servant Elijah the Tishbite : in the confine of Jezreel the dog shall devour the flesh of Jezebel .        the corpse of Jezebel shall be like dung in the field in the confine of Jezreel , so that no one can say : this be Jezebel .
