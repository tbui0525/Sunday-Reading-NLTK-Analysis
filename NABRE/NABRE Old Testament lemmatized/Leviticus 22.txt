b '   Priestly Purity .      the   Lord   say to Moses :      tell Aaron and his son to treat with respect the sacred offering which the Israelites consecrate to I ; otherwise they will profane my holy name . I be the   Lord .      tell they : if any one of you , or of your descendant in any future generation , dare , while he be in a state of uncleanness , to draw near the sacred offering which the Israelites consecrate to the   Lord , such a one shall be cut off from my presence .    I be the   Lord .     no descendant of Aaron who be stricken with a scaly infection ,    or who suffer from a genital discharge ,    may eat of the sacred offering , until he again become clean . moreover , if anyone touch a person who have become unclean by contact with a corpse ,    or if anyone have have an emission of semen ,        or if anyone touch any swarm creature    whose uncleanness be contagious or any person whose uncleanness , of whatever kind it may be , be contagious\xe2\x80\x94      the one who touch such as these shall be unclean until evening and may not eat of the sacred portion until he have first bathe his body in water .        then , when the sun set , he shall be clean .    only then may he eat of the sacred offering , for they be his food .       he shall not make himself unclean by eat of any animal that have die of itself or have be kill by wild beast .    I be the   Lord .     they shall keep my charge so that they will not bear the punishment in this matter and die    for their profanation . I be the   Lord   who make they holy .     neither an unauthorized person nor a priest tenant or laborer may eat of any sacred offering .        but a slave    whom a priest acquire by purchase or who be bear in his house may eat of his food .       a priest daughter who be married to an unauthorized person may not eat of the sacred contribution .      but if a priest daughter be widow or divorce and , have no child , return to her father house , she may then eat of her father food as in her youth . no unauthorized person , however , may eat of it .       if such a one eat of a sacred offering through inadvertence , that person shall make restitution to the priest for the sacred offering , with an increment of one fifth of the amount .      the priest shall not allow the sacred offering which the Israelites contribute to the   Lord   to be profane        nor make they incur a penalty when they eat their sacred offering . for I , the   Lord , make they holy .    unacceptable Victims .      the   Lord   say to Moses :      speak to Aaron and his son and to all the Israelites , and tell they : when anyone of the house of Israel , or any alien reside in Israel , who present an offering , bring a burn offering    as a votive offering or as a voluntary offering to the   Lord ,      if it be to be acceptable for you , it must be an unblemished male of the herd , of the sheep or of the goat .        you shall not offer one that have any blemish , for such a one would not be acceptable on your behalf .        when anyone present a communion sacrifice    to the   Lord   from the herd or the flock in fulfillment of a vow , or as a voluntary offering , if it be to find acceptance , it must be unblemishe ; it shall not have any blemish .      one that be blind or lame or maim , or one that have run lesion or sore or scab , you shall not offer to the   Lord ; do not put such an animal on the altar as an oblation to the   Lord .       an ox or a sheep that have a leg that be too long or be stunt you may indeed present as a voluntary offering , but it will not be acceptable as a votive offering .      one that have its testicle bruise or crush or tear out or cut off you shall not offer to the   Lord . you shall neither do this in your own land      nor receive from a foreigner any such animal to offer up as the food of your God ; since they be deform or blemish , they will not be acceptable on your behalf .      the   Lord   say to Moses :      when an ox or a lamb or a goat be bear , it shall remain with its mother for seven day ; only from the eighth day onward will it be acceptable , to be offer as an oblation to the   Lord .        you shall not slaughter an ox or a sheep on one and the same day with its young .      whenever you offer a thanksgive sacrifice to the   Lord , so offer it that it may be acceptable on your behalf ;      it must be eat on the same day ; none of it shall be leave over until morning .    I be the   Lord .     be careful to observe my commandment . I be the   Lord .      do not profane my holy name , that in the midst of the Israelites I may be hallow . I , the   Lord , make you holy ,      who lead you out of the land of Egypt to be your God . I be the   Lord .             '
