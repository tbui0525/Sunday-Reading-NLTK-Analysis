b '    I make a covenant with my eye   not to gaze upon a virgin .   what portion come from God above ,   what heritage from the Almighty on high ?   be it not calamity for the unrighteous ,   and woe for evildoer ?   do he not see my way ,   and number all my step ?    if I have walk in falsehood    and my foot have hasten to deceit ,   let God weigh I in the scale of justice ;   thus will he know my innocence !    if my step have turn out of the way ,   and my heart have follow my eye ,   or any stain cling to my hand ,   then may I sow , but another eat ,   and may my produce be root up !   if my heart have be entice toward a woman ,   and I have lie in wait at my neighbor door ;   then may my wife grind for another ,   and may other kneel over she !   for that would be heinous ,   a crime to be condemn ,    a fire that would consume down to Abaddon    till it uproot all my crop .    have I refuse justice to my manservant   or to my maidservant , when they have a complaint against I ,   what then should I do when God rise up ?   what could I answer when he demand an account ?   do not he who make I in the belly make he ?   do not the same one fashion we in the womb ?   if I have deny anything that the poor desire ,    or allow the eye of the widow to languish   while I eat my portion alone ,   with no share in it for the fatherless ,   though like a father he    have rear I from my youth ,   guide I even from my mother womb\xe2\x80\x94   if I have see a wanderer without clothing ,   or a poor man without cover ,   whose limb have not bless I   when warm with the fleece of my sheep ;   if I have raise my hand against the innocent   because I see that I have supporter at the gate\xe2\x80\x94    then may my arm fall from the shoulder ,   my forearm be break at the elbow !   for I dread calamity from God ,   and his majesty will overpower I .   have I put my trust in gold   or call fine gold my security ;   or have I rejoice that my wealth be great ,   or that my hand have acquire abundance\xe2\x80\x94   have I look upon the light    as it shine ,    or the moon in the splendor of its progress ,   and have my heart be secretly entice   to blow they a kiss with my hand ,   this too would be a crime for condemnation ,   for I should have deny God above .    have I rejoice at the destruction of my enemy   or exult when evil come upon he ,    even though I have not allow my mouth to sin   by invoke a curse against his life\xe2\x80\x94   have not the man of my tent exclaim ,   who have not be fill with his meat !    no stranger lodge in the street ,   for I open my door to wayfarers\xe2\x80\x94    have I , all too human , hide my sin   and bury my guilt in my bosom   because I fear the great multitude   and the scorn of the clan terrify me\xe2\x80\x94   then I should have remain silent , and not come out of door !    oh , that I have one to hear my case :   here be my signature :    let the Almighty answer I ! let my accuser write out his indictment !    surely , I should wear it on my shoulder    or put it on I like a diadem ;   of all my step I should give he an account ;   like a prince    I should present myself before he .   if my land have cry out against I   till its furrow weep together ;   if I have eat its strength without payment   and grieve the heart of its tenant ;   then let the thorn grow instead of wheat   and stinkweed instead of barley ! the word of Job be end .
