b '   Egypt the Crocodile .     in the tenth year , on the twelfth day of the tenth month ,    the word of the   Lord   come to I :      Son of man , turn your face toward Pharaoh , king of Egypt , and prophesy against he and against all Egypt .         say to he : thus say the Lord   God : pay attention ! I be against you ,   Pharaoh , king of Egypt , great dragon    crouch   in the midst of the Nile , who say , the Nile belong to I ;   I make it myself !     I will put hook in your jaw   and make all the fish of your Nile Cling to your scale ;   I will drag you up from your Nile , with all the fish of your Nile   cling to your scale .    I will hurl you into the wilderness ,   you and all the fish of your Nile . you will fall into an open field ,   you will not be pick up or gather together . to the beast of the earth   and the bird of the sky   I give you as food .     then all the inhabitant of Egypt   will know that I be the   Lord . because you be a staff of reed    for the house of Israel :   when they take hold of you , you would splinter ,   throw shoulder out of joint . when they lean on you , you would break ,   pitch they down headlong .   therefore thus say the Lord   God : look ! I be bring the sword against you   to cut off from you people and animal .   the land of Egypt shall become a desolate waste ;   then they shall know that I be the   Lord . because you say , the Nile belong to I ;   I make it !   Beware ! I be against you   and against your Nile . I will turn the land of Egypt into ruin ,   into a dry , desolate waste , from Migdol to Syene ,    up to the border of Ethiopia .    no foot shall pass through it ,   no human being or beast cross it ;   it will remain uninhabited for forty year .   I will make the land of Egypt the most desolate   among desolate land ; its city , the most deserted   among deserted city for forty year ; I will scatter the Egyptians among the nation   and disperse they throughout other land .    but thus say the Lord   God :   at the end of forty year I will gather the Egyptians   from among the people   where they be scatter ;   I will restore Egypts fortune ,   bring they back to the land of Pathros ,    the land of their origin . but there it will be a lowly kingdom ,    low than any other kingdom ,   no long able to set itself above the nation . I will make they few in number ,   so they can not rule other nation .   no long shall they be security   for the house of Israel , but a reminder of its iniquity   in turn away to follow they . then they shall know that I be the Lord   God .     wage for Nebuchadnezzar .     in the twenty - seventh year on the first day of the first month ,    the word of the   Lord   come to I :      Son of man , Nebuchadnezzar , the king of Babylon , have make his army wage a hard campaign against Tyre ;    their head grow bald , their shoulder rub raw , yet neither he nor his army receive compensation from Tyre for all the effort they expend against it .        therefore thus say the Lord   God :    see ! I be give to Nebuchadnezzar , king of Babylon , the land of Egypt ! he will carry off its wealth , plunder and pillaging whatever he can find to provide pay for his army .      as payment for his toil I give he the land of Egypt\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the Lord   God .     on that day I will make a horn    sprout for the house of Israel , and I will let you again open your mouth in their midst ; then they shall know that I be the   Lord .
