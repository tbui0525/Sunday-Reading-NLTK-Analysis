b '   promise of Redemption and Restoration   but now , thus say the   Lord ,   who create you , Jacob , and form you , Israel : do not fear , for I have redeem you ;   I have call you by name : you be mine .   when you pass through water , I will be with you ;   through river , you shall not be sweep away . when you walk through fire , you shall not be burn ,   nor will flame consume you .   for I , the   Lord , be your God ,   the Holy One of Israel , your savior . I give Egypt as ransom for you ,   Ethiopia and Seba    in exchange for you .   because you be precious in my eye   and honor , and I love you , I give people in return for you   and nation in exchange for your life .    Fear not , for I be with you ;   from the east I will bring back your offspring ,   from the west I will gather you .   I will say to the north : give they up !   and to the south : do not hold they ! bring back my son from afar ,   and my daughter from the end of the earth :    all who be call by my name   I create for my glory ;   I form they , make they .   lead out the people , blind though they have eye ,   deaf though they have ear .     let all the nation gather together ,   let the people assemble ! who among they could have declare this ,   or announce to we the early thing ?   let they produce witness to prove themselves right ,   that one may hear and say , it be true !   you be my witness   \xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord \xe2\x80\x94   my servant whom I have choose to know and believe in I   and understand that I be he . before I no god be form ,   and after I there shall be none .   I , I be the   Lord ;   there be no savior but I .   it be I who declare , who save ,   who announce , not some strange god among you ; you be my witnesses\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord .   I be God ,    yes , from eternity I be he ; there be none who can deliver from my hand :   I act and who can cancel it ?      thus say the   Lord , your redeemer ,    the Holy One of Israel : for your sake I send to Babylon ;   I will bring down all her defense ,   and the Chaldeans shall cry out in lamentation .   I be the   Lord , your Holy One ,   the creator of Israel , your king .   thus say the   Lord ,   who open a way in the sea ,   a path in the mighty water ,    who lead out chariot and horseman ,   a powerful army , till they lie prostrate together , never to rise ,   snuff out , quench like a wick .    remember not    the event of the past ,   the thing of long ago consider not ;   see , I be do something new !   now it spring forth , do you not perceive it ? in the wilderness I make a way ,   in the wasteland , river .   wild beast honor I ,   jackal and ostrich , for I put water in the wilderness   and river in the wasteland   for my choose people to drink ,   the people whom I form for myself ,   that they might recount my praise .     yet you do not call upon I , Jacob ,    for you grow weary of I , Israel .   you do not bring I sheep for your burn offering ,   nor honor I with your sacrifice . I do not exact from you the service of offering ,   nor weary you for frankincense .    you do not buy I sweet cane ,    nor do you fill I with the fat of your sacrifice ; instead , you burden I with your sin ,   weary I with your crime .   it be I , I , who wipe out ,   for my own sake , your offense ;   your sin I remember no more .   would you have I remember , have we come to trial ?   speak up , prove your innocence !   your first father    sin ;   your spokesman rebel against I   till I repudiate the holy prince ,   put Jacob under the ban ,   expose Israel to scorn .
