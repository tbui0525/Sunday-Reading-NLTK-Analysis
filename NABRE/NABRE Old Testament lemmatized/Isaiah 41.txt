b '   the Liberator of Israel   keep silence before I , o coastland ;    let the nation renew their strength . let they draw near and speak ;   let we come together for judgment .   who have stir up from the East the champion of justice ,   and summon he to be his attendant ? to he he deliver nation   and subdue king ; with his sword he reduce they to dust ,   with his bow , to drive straw .   he pursue they , pass on without loss ,   by a path his foot scarcely touch .   who have perform these deed ?   who have call forth the generation from the beginning ?   I , the   Lord , be the first ,   and at the last    I be he .   the coastland see , and fear ;   the end of the earth tremble :   they approach , they come on .     each one help his neighbor ,   one say to the other , Courage !   the woodworker encourage the goldsmith ,   the one who beat with the hammer , he who strike on the anvil , say of the soldering , it be good !   then fasten it with nail so it will not totter .     but you , Israel , my servant ,    Jacob , whom I have choose ,   offspring of Abraham my friend\xe2\x80\x94   you whom I have take from the end of the earth   and summon from its far - off place , to whom I have say , you be my servant ;   I choose you , I have not reject you\xe2\x80\x94   do not fear : I be with you ;   do not be anxious : I be your God . I will strengthen you , I will help you ,   I will uphold you with my victorious right hand .     yes , all shall be put to shame and disgrace   who vent their anger against you ; those shall be as nothing and perish   who offer resistance .   you shall seek but not find   those who strive against you ; they shall be as nothing at all   who do battle with you .     for I be the   Lord , your God ,   who grasp your right hand ; it be I who say to you , do not fear ,   I will help you .   do not fear , you worm Jacob ,   you maggot Israel ; I will help you\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord ;   the Holy One of Israel be your redeemer .    I will make of you a threshing sledge ,   sharp , new , full of tooth , to thresh the mountain and crush they ,   to make the hill like chaff .   when you winnow they , the wind shall carry they off ,   the storm shall scatter they . but you shall rejoice in the   Lord ;   in the Holy One of Israel you shall glory .     the afflict and the needy seek water in vain ,   their tongue be parch with thirst . I , the   Lord , will answer they ;   I , the God of Israel , will not forsake they .   I will open up river on the bare height ,   and fountain in the broad valley ; I will turn the wilderness into a marshland ,   and the dry ground into spring of water .   in the wilderness I will plant the cedar ,   acacia , myrtle , and olive ; in the wasteland I will set the cypress ,   together with the plane tree and the pine ,   that all may see and know ,   observe and understand , that the hand of the   Lord   have do this ,   the Holy One of Israel have create it .     present your case , say the   Lord ;    bring forward your argument , say the King of Jacob .   let they draw near and foretell to we   what it be that shall happen ! what be the thing of long ago ?   tell we , that we may reflect on they   and know their outcome ; or declare to we the thing to come ,     tell what be to be in the future ,   that we may know that you be god ! do something , good or evil ,   that will put we in awe and in fear .   why , you be nothing   and your work be nought ;   to choose you be an abomination !     I have stir up one from the north , and he come ;   from the east I summon he    by name ; he shall trample the ruler down like mud ,   like a potter tread clay .   who announce this from the beginning , that we might know ;   beforehand , that we might say , true ? not one of you foretell it , not one speak ;   not one hear you say ,   the first news for Zion : here they come ,   or , I will give Jerusalem a herald of good news .   when I look , there be not one ,   not one of they to give counsel ,   to make an answer when I question they .   ah , all of they be nothing ,   their work be nought ,   their idol , empty wind !
