b '   Caution regard Associates    touch pitch and you blacken your hand ;   associate with scoundrel and you learn their way .   do not lift a weight too heavy for you ,   or associate with anyone wealthy than you . how can the clay pot go with the metal cauldron ?   when they knock together , the pot will be smash :   the rich do wrong and boast of it ,   while the poor be wrong and beg forgiveness .   as long as the rich can use you they will enslave you ,   but when you be down and out they will abandon you .   as long as you have anything they will live with you ,   but they will drain you dry without remorse .   when they need you they will deceive you   and smile at you and raise your hope ;   they will speak kindly to you and say , what do you need ?   they will embarrass you at their dinner party ,   and finally laugh at you . afterwards , when they see you , they will pass you by ,   and shake their head at you .   be on guard : do not act too boldly ;   do not be like those who lack sense .     when the influential draw near , keep your distance ;   then they will urge you all the more .   do not draw too close , lest you be rebuff ,   but do not keep too far away lest you be regard as an enemy .   do not venture to be free with they ,   do not trust their many word ; for by prolong talk they will test you ,   and though smile they will probe you .   mercilessly they will make you a laughingstock ,   and will not refrain from injury or chain .   be on your guard and take care   never to accompany lawless people .      every live thing love its own kind ,   and we all love someone like ourselves .   every live being keep close to its own kind ;   and people associate with their own kind .   be a wolf ever ally with a lamb ?   so the sinner with the righteous .    can there be peace between the hyena and the dog ?   or peace between the rich and the poor ?    wild donkey of the desert be lion prey ;   likewise the poor be feed ground for the rich .   Humility be an abomination to the proud ;   and the poor be an abomination to the rich .   when the rich stumble they be support by friend ;   when the poor trip they be push down by friend .   when the rich speak they have many supporter ;   though what they say be repugnant , it win approval . when the poor speak people say , come , come , speak up !   though they be talk sense , they get no hearing .   when the rich speak all be silent ,   their wisdom people extol to the cloud . when the poor speak people say : who be that ?   if they stumble , people knock they down .      Wealth be good where there be no sin ;    but poverty be evil by the standard of the proud .   the heart change one face ,   either for good or for evil .    the sign of a good heart be a radiant face ;   withdraw and perplexed be the toil schemer .
