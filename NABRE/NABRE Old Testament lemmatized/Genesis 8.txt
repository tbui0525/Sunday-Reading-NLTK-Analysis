b '    God remember Noah and all the animal , wild and tame , that be with he in the ark . so God make a wind sweep over the earth , and the water begin to subside .      the fountain of the abyss and the floodgate of the sky be closed , and the downpour from the sky be hold back .      gradually the water recede from the earth . at the end of one hundred and fifty day , the water have so diminish      that , in the seventh month , on the seventeenth day of the month , the ark come to rest on the mountain of Ararat .        the water continue to diminish until the tenth month , and on the first day of the tenth month the top of the mountain appear .     at the end of forty day Noah open the hatch of the ark that he have make ,       and he release a raven . it fly back and forth until the water dry off from the earth .      then he release a dove , to see if the water have lessen on the earth .      but the dove could find no place to perch , and it return to he in the ark , for there be water over all the earth . put out his hand , he catch the dove and draw it back to he inside the ark .      he wait yet seven day more and again release the dove from the ark .      in the evening the dove come back to he , and there in its bill be a pluck - off olive leaf ! so Noah know that the water have diminish on the earth .      he wait yet another seven day and then release the dove ; but this time it do not come back .      in the six hundred and first year , in the first month , on the first day of the month , the water begin to dry up on the earth . Noah then remove the covering of the ark and see that the surface of the ground have dry .      in the second month , on the twenty - seventh day of the month , the earth be dry .     then God say to Noah :      go out of the ark , together with your wife and your son and your son wife .      bring out with you every living thing that be with you\xe2\x80\x94all creature , be they bird or animal or crawl thing that crawl on the earth\xe2\x80\x94and let they abound on the earth , and be fertile and multiply on it .        so Noah come out , together with his son and his wife and his son wife ;      and all the animal , all the bird , and all the crawl creature that crawl on the earth go out of the ark by family .     then Noah build an altar to the   Lord , and choose from every clean animal and every clean bird , he offer burn offering on the altar .      when the   Lord   smell the sweet odor , the   Lord   say to himself : never again will I curse the ground because of human being , since the desire of the human heart be evil from youth ; nor will I ever again strike down every live being , as I have do .      all the day of the earth ,   seedtime and harvest ,   cold and heat , Summer and winter ,   and day and night   shall not cease .
