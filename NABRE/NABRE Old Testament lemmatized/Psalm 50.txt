b ' the Acceptable Sacrifice   a psalm of Asaph . I the God of god , the   Lord ,   have speak and summon the earth   from the rise of the sun to its setting .    from Zion , the perfection of beauty , God shine forth .    our God come and will not be silent !   devour fire precede he ,   it rage strongly around he .    he call to the heaven above   and to the earth to judge his people :   gather my loyal one to I ,   those who make a covenant with I by sacrifice .   the heavens proclaim his righteousness ,   for God himself be the judge .   Selah    II   listen , my people , I will speak ;   Israel , I will testify against you ;   God , your God , be i.   not for your sacrifice do I rebuke you ,   your burn offering be always before I .   I will not take a bullock from your house ,   or he - goat from your fold .    for every animal of the forest be mine ,   beast by the thousand on my mountain .   I know every bird in the height ;   whatever move in the wild be mine .   be I hungry , I would not tell you ,   for mine be the world and all that fill it .    do I eat the flesh of bull   or drink the blood of he - goat ?   offer praise as your sacrifice to God ;    fulfill your vow to the most high .   then call on I on the day of distress ;    I will rescue you , and you shall honor I .    III   but to the wicked God say :   why do you recite my commandment   and profess my covenant with your mouth ?   you hate discipline ;   you cast my word behind you !   if you see a thief , you run with he ;   with adulterer you throw in your lot .   you give your mouth free rein for evil ;   you yoke your tongue to deceit .   you sit and speak against your brother ,   slander your mother son .   when you do these thing should I be silent ?   do you think that I be like you ?   I accuse you , I lie out the matter before your eye .    IV   now understand this , you who forget God ,   lest I start rip apart and there be no rescuer .   those who offer praise as a sacrifice honor I ;   I will let he whose way be steadfast   look upon the salvation of God .
