b '   priest .     the levitical priest , the whole tribe of Levi , shall have no hereditary portion with Israel ; they shall eat the fire offering of the   Lord   and the portion due to he .        they shall have no heritage among their kindred ; the   Lord   himself be their heritage , as he have tell they .        this shall be the due of the priest from the people : those who be offer a sacrifice , whether an ox or a sheep , shall give the priest the shoulder , the jowl and the stomach .      the first fruit of your grain , your wine , and your oil ,    as well as the first shearing of your flock , you shall also give he .      for the   Lord , your God , have choose he out of all your tribe to be in attendance to minister in the name of the   Lord , he and his descendant for all time .      when a Levite go from one of your community anywhere in Israel in which he have be reside , to visit , as his heart may desire , the place which the   Lord   will choose ,      and minister there in the name of the   Lord , his God , like all his fellow levite who stand before the   Lord   there ,      he shall receive the same portion to eat , along with his stipend and patrimony .     prophet .     when you come into the land which the   Lord , your God , be give you , you shall not learn to imitate the abomination of the nation there .         let there not be find among you anyone who cause their son or daughter to pass through the fire ,    or practice divination , or be a soothsayer , augur , or sorcerer ,      or who cast spell , consult ghost and spirit , or seek oracle from the dead .      anyone who do such thing be an abomination to the   Lord , and because of such abomination the   Lord , your God , be dispossess they before you .        you must be altogether sincere with the   Lord , your God .      although these nation whom you be about to dispossess listen to their soothsayer and diviner , the   Lord , your God , will not permit you to do so .     a prophet like I    will the   Lord , your God , raise up for you from among your own kindred ; that be the one to whom you shall listen .        this be exactly what you request of the   Lord , your God , at Horeb on the day of the assembly , when you say , let I not again hear the voice of the   Lord , my God , nor see this great fire any more , or I will die .        and the   Lord   say to I , what they have say be good .      I will raise up for they a prophet like you from among their kindred , and will put my word into the mouth of the prophet ; the prophet shall tell they all that I command .        anyone who will not listen to my word which the prophet speak in my name , I myself will hold accountable for it .        but if a prophet presume to speak a word in my name    that I have not command , or speak in the name of other god , that prophet shall die .     should you say to yourself , how can we recognize that a word be one the   Lord   have not speak ? ,      if a prophet speak in the name of the   Lord   but the word do not come true , it be a word the   Lord   do not speak . the prophet have speak it presumptuously ; do not fear he .
