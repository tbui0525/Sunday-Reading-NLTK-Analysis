b ' lament after Defeat in Battle   for the leader ; accord to the Lily of.\xe2\x80\xa6 a   miktam   of David ( for teaching ) ,      when he fight against Aram - Naharaim and Aram - Zobah ; and Joab , come back , kill twelve thousand Edomites in the Valley of Salt .     I   o God , you reject we , break our defense ;   you be angry but now revive we .   you rock the earth , split it open ;    repair the crack for it totter .   you make your people go through hardship ,   make we stagger from the wine you give we .    raise up a banner for those who revere you ,   a refuge for they out of bow shot . Selah    help with your right hand and answer we   that your loved one may escape .    II    in the sanctuary God promise :   I will exult , will apportion Shechem ;   the valley of Succoth I will measure out .   Gilead be mine , mine be Manasseh ;   Ephraim be the helmet for my head ,   Judah , my own scepter .     Moab be my washbowl ;   upon Edom I cast my sandal .   I will triumph over Philistia .    III   who will bring I to the fortified city ?    who will lead I into Edom ?   be it not you who reject we , God ?   do you no long march with our army ?    give we aid against the foe ;   worthless be human help .   we will triumph with the help of God ,   who will trample down our foe .
