b '   Acts symbolic of the exile .     the word of the   Lord   come to I :      Son of man , you live in the midst of a rebellious house ; they have eye to see , but do not see , and ear to hear but do not hear . they be such a rebellious house !        now , son of man , during the day while they watch , pack a bag for exile ,    and again while they watch , go into exile from your place to another place ; perhaps they will see that they be a rebellious house .      during the day , while they watch , bring out your bag , an exile bag . in the evening , again while they watch , go out as if into exile .        while they watch , dig a hole through the wall    and go out through it .      while they watch , shoulder your load and go out in darkness . cover your face so you can not see the land , for I be make you a sign for the house of Israel !      I do just as I be command . during the day I bring out my bag , an exile bag . in the evening while they watch , I dig a hole through the wall with my hand and set out in darkness , shoulder my load .     in the morning , the word of the   Lord   come to I :      Son of man , do not the house of Israel , that house of rebel , say , what be you do ?        tell they : thus say the Lord   God : this load be the prince in Jerusalem and the whole house of Israel within it .      say , I be a sign for you : just as I have do , so it shall be do to they ; into exile , as captive they shall go .        the prince among they shall shoulder his load in darkness and go out through the hole they dig in the wall to bring he out . his face shall be cover so that he can not even see the ground .         I will spread my net over he and he shall be catch in my snare . I will bring he into Babylon , to the land of the Chaldeans , though he shall not see it ,    and there he shall die .      all his retinue , his aide and all his troop , I will scatter to the wind and pursue they with the sword .        then they shall know that I be the   Lord , when I disperse they among the nation and scatter they throughout the land .        but I will let a few of they escape the sword , starvation , and plague , so that they may recount all their abomination among the nation to which they go . thus they may know that I be the   Lord .      the word of the   Lord   come to I :      Son of man , eat your bread tremble and drink your water shake with fear .        and say to the people of the land :    thus say the Lord   God   about the inhabitant of Jerusalem in the land of Israel : they shall eat their bread in fear and drink their water in horror , because the land will be empty of what fill it\xe2\x80\x94the lawlessness of all its inhabitant .      inhabit city shall be in ruin , the land a desolate place . then you shall know that I be the   Lord .
