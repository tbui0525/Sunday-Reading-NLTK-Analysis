b '   the Seduction     my son , keep my word ,   and treasure my command .   keep my command and live ,    and my teaching as the apple of your eye ;   bind they on your finger ,   write they on the tablet of your heart .    say to wisdom , you be my sister !    call Understanding , friend !   that they may keep you from a stranger ,   from the foreign woman with her smooth word .    for at the window of my house ,   through my lattice I look out    and I see among the naive ,   I observe among the young man ,   a youth with no sense ,   cross the street near the corner ,   then walk toward her house ,   in the twilight , at dusk of day ,   in the very dark of night .   then the woman come to meet he ,   dress like a harlot , with secret design .   she be raucous and unruly ,   her foot can not stay at home ;   now she be in the street , now in the open square ,   lurk in ambush at every corner .   then she grab he , kiss he ,   and with an impudent look say to he :   I owe peace offering ,   and today I have fulfil my vow ;   so I come out to meet you ,   to look for you , and I have find you !   with coverlet I have spread my couch ,   with brocade cloth of egyptian linen ;   I have sprinkle my bed    with myrrh ,   with aloe , and with cinnamon .   come , let we drink our fill of love ,   until morning , let we feast on love !   for my husband be not at home ,    he have go on a long journey ;   a bag of money he take with he ,   he will not return home till the full moon .   she win he over by repeat urging ,   with her smooth lip she lead he astray .     he follow she impulsively ,   like an ox that go to slaughter ; like a stag that bound toward the net ,    till an arrow pierce its liver ; like a bird that rush into a snare ,   unaware that his life be at stake .   so now , child , listen to I ,    be attentive to the word of my mouth !   do not let your heart turn to her way ,   do not go astray in her path ;   for many be those she have strike down dead ,   numerous , those she have slay .   her house be a highway to Sheol ,   lead down into the chamber of death .
