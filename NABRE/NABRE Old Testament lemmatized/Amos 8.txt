b '   fourth Vision : the Summer Fruit   this be what the Lord   God   show I : a basket of end - of - summer fruit .        he ask , what do you see , Amos ? and I answer , a basket of end - of - summer fruit . and the   Lord   say to I : the end have come for my people Israel ;   I will forgive they no long .   the temple singer will wail on that day\xe2\x80\x94   oracle of the Lord   God . many shall be the corpse ,   strew everywhere\xe2\x80\x94silence !      hear this , you who trample upon the needy   and destroy the poor of the land :   when will the new moon be over , you ask ,   that we may sell our grain , and the sabbath ,   that we may open the grain - bin ? we will diminish the ephah ,    add to the shekel ,   and fix our scale for cheat !    we will buy the destitute for silver ,   and the poor for a pair of sandal ;    even the worthless grain we will sell !   the   Lord   have swear by the pride of Jacob :   never will I forget a thing they have do !   shall not the land tremble because of this ,   and all who dwell in it mourn ? it will all rise up and toss like the Nile ,   and subside like the river of Egypt .    on that day\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the Lord   God \xe2\x80\x94   I will make the sun set at midday   and in broad daylight cover the land with darkness .   I will turn your feast into mourning   and all your song into dirge . I will cover the loin of all with sackcloth   and make every head bald . I will make it like the time of mourning for an only child ,   and its outcome like a day of bitter weeping .      see , day be coming\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the Lord   God \xe2\x80\x94   when I will send a famine upon the land : not a hunger for bread , or a thirst for water ,   but for hear the word of the   Lord .   they shall stagger from sea to sea   and wander from north to east in search of the word of the   Lord ,   but they shall not find it .      on that day , beautiful young woman and young man   shall faint from thirst ,   those who swear by Ashima of Samaria ,     and who say , by the life of your god , o Dan , by the life of the Power of Beer - sheba !   they shall fall , never to rise again .
