b ' A prayer in Distress   a psalm of David . Lord , hear my prayer ;   in your faithfulness listen to my pleading ;   answer I in your righteousness .   do not enter into judgment with your servant ;   before you no one can be just .    the enemy have pursue my soul ;   he have crush my life to the ground .   he have make I dwell in darkness   like those long dead .    my spirit be faint within I ;   my heart despair .    I remember the day of old ;   I ponder all your deed ;   the work of your hand I recall .    I stretch out my hand toward you ,   my soul to you like a parched land .   Selah   Hasten to answer I ,   Lord ;   for my spirit fail I . do not hide your face from I ,   lest I become like those descend to the pit .    in the morning let I hear of your mercy ,   for in you I trust . show I the path I should walk ,   for I entrust my life to you .    Rescue I ,   Lord , from my foe ,   for I seek refuge in you .   teach I to do your will ,   for you be my God . may your kind spirit guide I   on ground that be level .   for your name sake ,   Lord , give I life ;   in your righteousness lead my soul out of distress .   in your mercy put an end to my foe ;   all those who be oppress my soul ,   for I be your servant .
