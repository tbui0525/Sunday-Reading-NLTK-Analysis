b '   Social and Economic Problems .      then there rise a great outcry of the people and their wife against certain of their jewish kindred .        some say : we be force to pawn our son and daughter in order to get grain to eat that we may live .      other say : we be force to pawn our field , our vineyard , and our house , that we may have grain during the famine .      still other say : to pay the king tax we have borrow money on our field and vineyard .       and though these be our own kindred , and our child be as good as theirs , we have have to reduce our son and daughter to slavery , and violence have be do to some of our daughter ! yet we can do nothing about it , for our field and vineyard belong to other .     I be extremely angry when I hear the reason for their complaint .       after some deliberation , I call the noble and magistrate to account , say to they , you be exact interest from your own kindred !    I then rebuke they severely ,       say to they : as far as we be able , we buy back our jewish kindred who have be sell to Gentiles ; you , however , be sell your own kindred , to have they buy back by we . they remain silent , for they could find no answer .      I continue : what you be do be not good . should you not conduct yourself out of fear of our God rather than fear of the reproach of our gentile enemy ?      I myself , my kindred , and my attendant have lend the people money and grain without charge . let we put an end to this usury !      return to they this very day their field , vineyard , olive grove , and house , together with the interest on the money , the grain , the wine , and the oil that you have lend they .      they answer : we will return everything and exact nothing far from they . we will do just what you ask . then I call for the priest to administer an oath to they that they would do as they have promise .      I shake out the fold of my garment , say , thus may God shake from home and fortune every man who fail to keep this promise , and may he thus be shake out and empty ! and the whole assembly answer , amen , and praise the   Lord . then the people do as they have promise .
