b '   how different the person who devote himself   to the study of the law of the most high !   he explore the wisdom of all the ancient   and be occupy with the prophecy ;   he preserve the discourse of the famous ,   and go to the heart of involved saying ;   he seek out the hidden meaning of proverb ,   and be busy with the enigmas find in parable .     he be in attendance on the great ,   and appear before ruler . he travel among the people of foreign land   to test what be good and evil among people .   his care be to rise early   to seek the Lord his Maker ,   to petition the most high , to open his mouth in prayer ,   to ask pardon for his sin .     if it please the Lord Almighty ,   he will be fill with the spirit of understanding ; he will pour forth his word of wisdom   and in prayer give praise to the Lord .   he will direct his knowledge and his counsel ,   as he meditate upon Gods mystery .   he will show the wisdom of what he have learn   and glory in the Law of the Lords covenant .     many will praise his understanding ;   his name can never be blot out ; Unfading will be his memory ,   through all generation his name will live ;    Peoples will speak of his wisdom ,   and the assembly will declare his praise .   while he live he be one out of a thousand ,   and when he die he leave a good name .    praise of God the Creator    once more I will set forth my theme   to shine like the moon in its fullness !   listen to I , my faithful child : open up your petal ,   like rose plant near running water ;   send up the sweet odor of incense ,   break forth in blossom like the lily . raise your voice in a chorus of praise ;   bless the Lord for all his work !   proclaim the greatness of his name ,   loudly sing his praise , with music on the harp and all stringed instrument ;   sing out with joy as you proclaim :     the work of God be all of they good ;   he supply for every need in its own time .    at his word the water become still as in a flask ;   he have but to speak and the reservoir be make .    he have but to command and his will be do ;   nothing can limit his saving action .   the work of all humankind be present to he ;   nothing be hide from his eye .    his gaze span all the age :   be there any limit to his saving action ? to he , nothing be small or insignificant ,   and nothing too wonderful or hard for he .   no cause then to say : what be the purpose of this ?   everything be choose to satisfy a need .     his blessing overflow like the Nile ;   like the Euphrates it enrich the surface of the earth .   even so , his wrath dispossesses the nation   and turn fertile land into a salt marsh .    for the virtuous his path be level ,   to the haughty they be clog with stone .   good thing for the good he provide from the beginning ,   but for the wicked good thing and bad .   Chief of all need for human life   be water and fire , iron and salt , the heart of the wheat , milk and honey ,   the blood of the grape , and oil , and clothing .    for the good all these be good ,   but for the wicked they turn out evil .     there be stormwind create to punish ;   in their fury they can dislodge mountain . in a time of destruction they hurl their force   and calm the anger of their maker .   Fire and hail , famine and disease :   these too be create for punishment .   ravenous beast , scorpion , viper ,   and the avenge sword to exterminate the wicked : all these be create to meet a need ,   and be keep in his storehouse for the proper time .   when he command they , they rejoice ,   in their assign task they do not disobey his command .     that be why from the first I take my stand ,   and write down as my theme :   the work of God be all of they good ;   he supply for every need in its own time .    there be no cause then to say : this be not as good as that ;   for each show its worth at the proper time .   so now with full heart and voice proclaim   and bless his name !
