b ' trust in God Alone   for the leader ;   al Jeduthun .    a psalm of David .    I   my soul rest in God alone ,    from whom come my salvation .   God alone be my rock and salvation ,   my fortress ; I shall never fall .   how long will you set yourself against a man ?   you shall all be destroy , like a sag wall   or a tumble down fence !   even highly place people   plot to overthrow he . they delight in lie ;   they bless with their mouth ,   but inwardly they curse .   Selah    II   my soul , be at rest in God alone ,   from whom come my hope .   God alone be my rock and my salvation ,   my fortress ; I shall not fall .   my deliverance and honor be with God ,    my strong rock ;   my refuge be with God .   Trust God at all time , my people !   pour out your heart to God our refuge ! Selah    III   mortal be a mere breath ,   the son of man but an illusion ;   on a balance they rise ;    together they weigh nothing .   do not trust in extortion ;   in plunder put no empty hope . on wealth that increase ,   do not set your heart .     one thing God have say ;   two thing I have hear :   strength belong to God ;    so too , my Lord , do mercy , for you repay each man   accord to his deed .
