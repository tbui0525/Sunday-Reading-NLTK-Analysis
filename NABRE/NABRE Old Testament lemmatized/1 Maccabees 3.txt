b '    Judas and his early victory .     then his son Judas , who be call Maccabeus , take his place .      all his brother and all who have join his father support he , and they gladly carry on Israels war .     he spread abroad the glory of his people ,   and put on his breastplate like a giant . he arm himself with weapon of war ;   he fight battle and protect the camp with his sword .   in his deed he be like a lion ,   like a young lion roar for prey .   he pursue the lawless , hunt they out ,   and those who trouble his people he destroy by fire .   the lawless be cow by fear of he ,   and all evildoer be dismay . by his hand deliverance be happily achieve ,    and he afflict many king . he give joy to Jacob by his deed ,   and his memory be bless forever .   he go about the city of Judah   destroy the renegade there . he turn away wrath from Israel ,    be renowned to the end of the earth ;   and gather together those who be perish .     then Apollonius    gather together the Gentiles , along with a large army from Samaria , to fight against Israel .      when Judas learn of it , he go out to meet he and strike and kill he . many fall wound , and the rest flee .      they take their spoil , and Judas take the sword of Apollonius and fight with it the rest of his life .     but Seron , commander of the syrian army , hear that Judas have muster an assembly of faithful man ready for war .      so he say , I will make a name for myself and win honor in the kingdom . I will wage war against Judas and his follower , who have despise the king command .      and again a large company of renegade advance with he to help he take revenge on the Israelites .     when he reach the ascent of Beth - horon ,    Judas go out to meet he with a few man .      but when they see the army come against they , they say to Judas : how can we , few as we be , fight such a strong host as this ? besides , we be weak since we have not eat today .      but Judas say : many be easily hem in by a few ; in the sight of Heaven there be no difference between deliverance by many or by few ;      for victory in war do not depend upon the size of the army , but on strength that come from Heaven .        with great presumption and lawlessness they come against we to destroy we and our wife and child and to despoil we ;      but we be fight for our life and our law .      he    will crush they before we ; so do not fear they .      when he finish speak , he rush suddenly upon Seron and his army , who be crush before he .      he pursue Seron down the descent of Beth - horon into the plain . about eight hundred    of their man fall , and the rest flee to the land of the Philistines .      then Judas and his brother begin to be fear , and dread fall upon the Gentiles about they .      his fame reach the king , and the Gentiles talk about the battle of Judas .    the Kings Strategy .     when King Antiochus hear these report , he be fill with rage ; so he order that all the force of his kingdom be gather , a very strong army .      he open his treasury , give his soldier a year pay , and command they to be prepare for anything .      but then he see that this exhaust the money in his treasury ; moreover the tribute from the province be small because of the dissension and distress he have bring upon the land by abolish the law which have be in effect from of old .      he fear that , as have happen once or twice , he would not have enough for his expense and for the gift that he be accustom to give with a lavish hand\xe2\x80\x94more so than all previous king .      greatly perplexed , he decide to go to Persia and levy tribute on those province , and so raise a large sum of money .     he leave Lysias , a noble of royal descent , in charge of the king affair from the Euphrates River to the frontier of Egypt ,      and commission he to take care of his son Antiochus until his return .      he entrust to he half of his force , and the elephant , and give he instruction concern everything he want do . as for the inhabitant of Judea and Jerusalem ,      Lysias be to send an army against they to crush and destroy the power of Israel and the remnant of Jerusalem and efface their memory from the place .      he be to settle foreigner in all their territory and distribute their land by lot .       the king take the remain half of the army and set out from Antioch , his capital , in the year one hundred and forty - seven ; he cross the Euphrates River and go through the province beyond .    preparation for Battle .      Lysias choose Ptolemy , son of Dorymenes , and Nicanor    and Gorgias , powerful man among the king Friends ,      and with they he send forty thousand foot soldier and seven thousand cavalry to invade and ravage the land of Judah accord to the king order .      set out with their whole force , they come and pitch their camp near Emmaus    in the plain .      when the merchant of the region hear of their prowess , they come to the camp , bring a huge sum of silver and gold , along with fetter , to buy the Israelites as slave . a force from Edom and from Philistia join with they .     Judas and his brother see that evil have multiply and that army be encamped within their territory . they learn of the order which the king have give to destroy and utterly wipe out the people .      so they say to one another , let we raise our people from their ruin and fight for they and for our sanctuary !     the assembly gather together to prepare for battle and to pray and ask for mercy and compassion .     Jerusalem be uninhabited , like a wilderness ;   not one of her child come in or go out . the sanctuary be trample on ,   and foreigner be in the citadel ;   it be a habitation for Gentiles . Joy have disappear from Jacob ,   and the flute and the harp be silent .      thus they assemble and go to Mizpah near Jerusalem , because formerly at Mizpah there be a place of prayer for Israel .        that day they fast and wear sackcloth ; they sprinkle ashe on their head and tear their garment .      they unroll the scroll of the law , to learn about the thing for which the Gentiles consult the image of their idol .        they bring with they the priestly garment , the first fruit , and the tithe ; and they bring forward the nazirites     who have complete the time of their vow .      and they cry aloud to Heaven : what shall we do with these , and where shall we take they ?      for your sanctuary have be trample on and profane , and your priest be in mourning and humbled .      now the Gentiles be gather together against we to destroy we . you know what they plot against we .      how shall we be able to resist they unless you help we ?      then they blow the trumpet and cry out loudly .     after this Judas appoint officer for the people , over thousand , over hundred , over fifty , and over ten .      he proclaim that those who be build house , or be just married , or be plant vineyard , and those who be afraid , could each return home , accord to the law .        then the army move off , and they camp to the south of Emmaus .      Judas say : arm yourself and be brave ; in the morning be ready to fight these Gentiles who have assemble against we to destroy we and our sanctuary .      it be well for we to die in battle than to witness the evil befall our nation and our sanctuary .      whatever be willed in heaven will be do .
