b ' A prayer for Victory and Prosperity   of David . I   bless be the   Lord , my rock ,   who train my hand for battle ,   my finger for war ;   my safeguard and my fortress ,   my stronghold , my deliverer , my shield , in whom I take refuge ,   who subdue people under I .    II    Lord , what be man that you take notice of he ;   the son of man , that you think of he ?     Man be but a breath ,   his day be like a pass shadow .     Lord , incline your heaven and come down ;   touch the mountain and make they smoke .    Flash forth lightning and scatter my foe ;   shoot your arrow and rout they .   reach out your hand from on high ;   deliver I from the many water ;   rescue I from the hand of foreign foe .   their mouth speak untruth ;   their right hand be raise in lie oath .    o God , a new song I will sing to you ;   on a ten - stringed lyre I will play for you .    you give victory to king ;   you deliver David your servant .   from the menacing sword      deliver I ;   rescue I from the hand of foreign foe . their mouth speak untruth ;   their right hand be raise in lie oath .    III   may our son be like plant    well nurture from their youth , our daughter , like carved column ,   shapely as those of the temple .   may our barn be full   with every kind of store . may our sheep increase by thousand ,   by ten of thousand in our field ;   may our oxen be well fatten .   may there be no breach in the wall ,   no exile , no outcry in our street .    bless the people so fortunate ;   bless the people whose God be the   Lord .
