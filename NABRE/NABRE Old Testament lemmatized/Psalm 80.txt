b ' prayer to restore Gods Vineyard   for the leader ; accord to lily .   Eduth .    a psalm of Asaph .    I   o Shepherd of Israel , lend an ear ,   you who guide Joseph like a flock ! seat upon the cherubim , shine forth     upon Ephraim , Benjamin , and Manasseh . stir up your power , and come to save we .     o God , restore we ;   light up your face and we shall be save .    II   Lord   of host ,   how long will you smolder in anger   while your people pray ?    you have feed they the bread of tear ,   make they drink tear in great measure .     you have leave we to be fight over by our neighbor ;   our enemy deride we .    o God of host , restore we ;   light up your face and we shall be save .    III   you bring a vine    out of Egypt ;   you drive out nation and plant it .   you clear out what be before it ;   it take deep root and fill the land .   the mountain be cover by its shadow ,   the cedar of God by its branch .   it send out its bough as far as the sea ,    its shoot as far as the river .   why have you break down its wall ,   so that all who pass along the way pluck its fruit ?    the boar from the forest strip the vine ;   the beast of the field feed upon it .    turn back again , God of host ;   look down from heaven and see ; visit this vine ,    the stock your right hand have plant ,   and the son    whom you make strong for yourself .   those who would burn or cut it down\xe2\x80\x94   may they perish at your rebuke .   may your hand be with the man on your right ,    with the son of man whom you make strong for yourself .   then we will not withdraw from you ;   revive we , and we will call on your name .   Lord   God of host , restore we ;   light up your face and we shall be save .             '
