b '    the beauty of the celestial height and the pure firmament ,    heaven itself manifest its glory .   the sun at its rise shine at its full ,   a wonderful instrument , the work of the most high !   at noon it scorch the earth ,   and who can bear its fiery heat ?   like a blaze furnace of solid metal ,   the sun ray set the mountain aflame ; its fiery tongue consume the world ;   the eye be burn by its fire .   great indeed be the   Lord   who make it ,   at whose order it urge on its steed .   it be the moon that mark the change season ,   govern the time , their last sign .    by it we know the sacred season and pilgrimage feast ,   a light which wane in its course :   the new moon like its name    renew itself ;   how wondrous it be when it change : a military signal for the waterskin on high ,   it pave the firmament with its brilliance ,   the beauty of the heaven and the glory of the star ,   a shine ornament in the height of God .    by the   Lord s command the moon keep its appoint place ,   and do not fade as the star keep watch .   behold the rainbow ! then bless its maker ,   for majestic indeed be its splendor ;    it span the heaven with its glory ,   the hand of God have stretch it out in power .     his rebuke mark out the path for the hail ,   and make the flash of his judgment shine forth .   for his own purpose he open the storehouse   and make the rain cloud fly like vulture .   his might give the cloud their strength ,   and break off the hailstone .   the thunder of his voice make the earth writhe ;   by his power he shake the mountain .   a word from he drive on the south wind ,   whirlwind , hurricane , and stormwind . he make the snow fly like bird ;   it settle down like swarm of locust .   its shine whiteness blind the eye ,   the mind marvel at its steady fall .   he scatter frost like salt ;   it shine like blossom on the thornbush .   he send cold northern blast   that harden the pond like solid ground , spread a crust over every body of water ,   and clothe each pool with a coat of armor .   when mountain growth be scorch by heat ,   and flower plain as by fire ,   the dripping cloud restore they all ,   and the scatter dew enrich the parched land .   his be the plan that calm the deep ,   and plant the island in the sea .   those who go down to the sea recount its extent ,   and when we hear they we be thunderstruck ;    in it be his creature , stupendous , amazing ,   all kind of life , and the monster of the deep .   for he each messenger succeed ,   and at his bidding accomplish his will .      More than this we need not add ;   let the last word be , he be the all !    let we praise he the more , since we can not fathom he ,   for great be he than all his work ;   awesome indeed be the   Lord ,   and wonderful his power .   lift up your voice to glorify the   Lord   as much as you can , for there be still more . Extol he with renew strength ,   do not grow weary , for you can not fathom he .   for who have see he and can describe he ?   who can praise he as he be ?    beyond these , many thing lie hide ;   only a few of his work have I see .   it be the   Lord   who have make all thing ;   to those who fear he he give wisdom .
