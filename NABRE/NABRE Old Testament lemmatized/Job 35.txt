b '     then Elihu answer and say :     do you think it right to say ,   I be in the right , not God ?    when you ask what it profit you ,   what advantage do I have from not sin ?    I have word for a reply to you    and your friend as well .   look up to the sky and see ;   behold the heavens high above you .   if you sin , what do you do to God ?   even if your offense be many , how do you affect he ?   if you be righteous , what do you give he ,   or what do he receive from your hand ?    your wickedness affect only someone like yourself ,   and your justice , only a fellow human being .   in great oppression people cry out ;   they call for help because of the power of the great ,   no one say , where be God , my Maker ,   who give song in the night ,   teach we more than the beast of the earth ,   and make we wise than the bird of the heaven ?   though thus they cry out , he do not answer   because of the pride of the wicked .   but it be idle to say God do not hear   or that the Almighty do not take notice .   even though you say , you take no notice of it ,    the case be before he ; with tremble wait upon he .   but now that you have do otherwise , Gods anger punish ,   nor do he show much concern over a life .   yet Job to no purpose open his mouth ,   multiply word without knowledge .
