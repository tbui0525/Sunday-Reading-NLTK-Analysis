b '   Jerusalem Reproached   ah ! rebellious and polluted ,   the tyrannical city !    it listen to no voice ,   accept no correction ; in the   Lord   it have not trust ,   nor draw near to its God .    its official within it   be roar lion ; its judge be desert wolf   that have no bone to gnaw by morning .    its prophet be reckless ,   treacherous people ; its priest profane what be holy ,   and do violence to the law .    but the   Lord   in its midst be just ,   do no wrong ; morning after morning render judgment   unfailingly , at dawn ;   the wicked , however , know no shame .     I have cut down nation ,   their battlement be lay waste ; I have make their street desert ,   with no one pass through ; their city be devastate ,   with no one dwell in they .    I say , surely now you will fear I ,   you will accept correction ; they can not fail to see   all I have bring upon they . yet the more eagerly they have do   all their corrupt deed .    the Nations punish and Jerusalem restore   therefore , wait for me\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord \xe2\x80\x94   until the day when I arise as accuser ; for it be my decision to gather nation ,   to assemble kingdom , in order to pour out upon they my wrath ,   all my blaze anger ; for in the fire of my passion   all the earth will be consume .      for then I will make pure   the speech of the people , that they all may call upon the name of the   Lord ,   to serve he with one accord ;   from beyond the river of Ethiopia   and as far as the recess of the North ,   they shall bring I offering .      on that day you will not be ashamed   of all your deed ,   when you rebel against I ; for then I will remove from your midst   the proud braggart , and you shall no long exalt yourself   on my holy mountain .   but I will leave as a remnant in your midst   a people humble and lowly , who shall take refuge in the name of the   Lord \xe2\x80\x94     the remnant of Israel . they shall do no wrong   and speak no lie ; nor shall there be find in their mouth   a deceitful tongue ; they shall pasture and lie down   with none to disturb they .    shout for joy , daughter Zion !   sing joyfully , Israel ! be glad and exult with all your heart ,   daughter Jerusalem !    the   Lord   have remove the judgment against you ,   he have turn away your enemy ; the King of Israel , the   Lord , be in your midst ,   you have no further misfortune to fear .    on that day , it shall be say to Jerusalem : do not fear , Zion ,   do not be discourage !   the   Lord , your God , be in your midst ,   a mighty savior , who will rejoice over you with gladness ,   and renew you in his love , who will sing joyfully because of you ,     as on festival day .    I will remove disaster from among you ,   so that no one may recount your disgrace .   at that time I will deal   with all who oppress you ; I will save the lame ,   and assemble the outcast ; I will give they praise and renown   in every land where they be shame .    at that time I will bring you home ,   and at that time I will gather you ; for I will give you renown and praise ,   among all the people of the earth , when I bring about your restoration   before your very eye , say the   Lord .
