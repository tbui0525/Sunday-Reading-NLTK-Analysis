b '   corruption of Cult , domestic and Foreign Politics   Put the trumpet to your lip !    one like an eagle    be over the house of the   Lord ! because they have violate my covenant ,   and rebel against my law ,   they cry out to I ,   my God ! we know you !   but Israel have reject what be good ;   the enemy    shall pursue he .      they make king , but not by my authority ;   they establish prince , but without my knowledge . with their silver and gold   they make idol for themselves ,   to their own destruction .   he have reject your calf ,    Samaria !    my wrath be kindle against they ; how long will they be incapable of innocence   in Israel ?   an artisan make it ,   it be no god at all .   the calf of Samaria   will be dash to piece .     when they sow the wind ,   they will reap the whirlwind ;   the stalk of grain that form no head   can yield no flour ; even if it could ,   stranger would swallow it .   Israel be swallow up ;   now they be among the nation ,   like a useless vessel .   for they go up to Assyria\xe2\x80\x94    a wild ass off on its own\xe2\x80\x94   Ephraim bargain for lover .    even though they bargain with the nation ,   I will now gather they    together ; they will soon succumb   under the burden of king and prince .      when Ephraim make many altar to expiate sin ,   they become altar for sin .   though I write for he my many instruction ,   they be consider like a stranger .   they love sacrifice ,   they sacrifice meat and eat it ,   but the   Lord   be not pleased with they .   now he will remember their guilt   and punish their sin ;    they shall return to Egypt .     Israel have forget his maker    and have build palace . Judah , too , have fortify many city ,   but I will send fire upon his city ,   to devour their stronghold .              '
