b '   incident at Joppa and Jamnia .     after these agreement be make , Lysias return to the king , and the Jews go about their farming .      but some of the local governor , Timothy and Apollonius , son of Gennaeus ,    as also Hieronymus and Demophon , to say nothing of Nicanor , the commander of the Cyprians , would not allow they to live in peace and quiet .     some people of Joppa also commit this outrage : they invite the Jews who live among they , together with their wife and child , to embark on boat which they have provide . there be no hint of enmity toward they .      this be do by public vote of the city . when the Jews , wish to live on friendly term and not suspect anything , accept the invitation , the people of Joppa take they out to sea and drown at least two hundred of they .     as soon as Judas hear of the barbarous deed perpetrate against his compatriot , he summon his man ;      and after call upon God , the just judge , he march against the murderer of his kindred . in a night attack he set the harbor on fire , burn the boat , and put to the sword those who have take refuge there .      because the gate of the town be shut , he withdraw , intend to come back later and wipe out the entire population of Joppa .     on hear that the people of Jamnia plan in the same way to wipe out the Jews who live among they ,      he attack the Jamnians by night , set fire to the harbor and the fleet , so that the glow of the flame be visible as far as Jerusalem , thirty mile away .    More victory by Judas .      when the Jews have go about a mile from there    in the march against Timothy , they be attack by Arabians number at least five thousand foot soldier and five hundred cavalry .      after a hard fight , Judas and his companion , with Gods help , be victorious . the defeat nomad beg Judas to give pledge of friendship , and they promise to supply the Jews with livestock and to be of service to they in any other way .      realize that they could indeed be useful in many respect , Judas agree to make peace with they . after the pledge of friendship have be exchange , the Arabians withdraw to their tent .     he also attack a certain city call Caspin , fortify with earthwork and wall and inhabit by a mixed population of Gentiles .      rely on the strength of their wall and their supply of provision , the besiege treat Judas and his man with contempt , insult they and even utter blasphemy and profanity .      but Judas and his man invoke the aid of the great Sovereign of the world , who , in the day of Joshua , overthrow Jericho without batter ram or siege engine ; then they furiously storm the wall .        capture the city by the will of God , they inflict such indescribable slaughter on it that the adjacent pool , which be about a quarter of a mile wide , seem to be fill with the blood that flow into it .      when they have go on some ninety mile , they reach Charax , where there be certain Jews know as Toubians .         but they do not find Timothy in that region , for he have already depart from there without having do anything except to leave behind in one place a very strong garrison .      but Dositheus and Sosipater , two of Maccabeus captain , march out and destroy the force of more than ten thousand man that Timothy have leave in the stronghold .      meanwhile , Maccabeus divide his army into cohort , with a commander over each cohort , and go in pursuit of Timothy , who have a force of a hundred and twenty thousand foot soldier and twenty - five hundred cavalry .      when Timothy learn of the approach of Judas , he send on ahead of he the woman and child , as well as the baggage , to a place call Karnion , which be hard to besiege and even hard to reach because of the difficult terrain of that region .      but when Judas first cohort appear , the enemy be overwhelmed with fear and terror at the manifestation of the all - see one . scatter in every direction , they rush away in such headlong flight that in many case they wound one another , pierce by the point of their own sword .      Judas press the pursuit vigorously , put the sinner to the sword and destroy as many as thirty thousand man .     Timothy himself fall into the hand of those under Dositheus and Sosipater ; but with great cunning , he beg they to spare his life and let he go , because he have in his power the parent and relative of many of they , and would show they no consideration .      when he have fully confirm his solemn pledge to restore they unharmed , they let he go for the sake of save their relative .      Judas then march to Karnion and the shrine of Atargatis ,    where he kill twenty - five thousand people .      after the defeat and destruction of these , he move his army to Ephron , a fortified city inhabit by Lysias and people of many nationality . robust young man take up their post in defense of the wall , from which they fight valiantly ; inside be large supply of war machine and missile .      but the Jews , invoke the Sovereign who powerfully shatter the might of enemy , get possession of the city and slaughter twenty - five thousand of the people in it .     then they set out from there and hasten on to Scythopolis ,    seventy - five mile from Jerusalem .      but when the Jews who live there testify to the goodwill show by the Scythopolitans and to their kind treatment even in time of adversity ,      Judas and his man thank they and exhort they to be well disposed to their nation in the future also . finally they arrive in Jerusalem , shortly before the feast of Weeks .     after this feast , also call Pentecost , they lose no time in marching against Gorgias , governor of Idumea ,      who oppose they with three thousand foot soldier and four hundred cavalry .      in the ensue battle , a few of the Jews be slay .      a man call Dositheus , a powerful horseman and one of Bacenors man ,    catch hold of Gorgias , grasp his military cloak and drag he along by brute strength , intend to capture the vile wretch alive , when a thracian horseman attack Dositheus and cut off his arm at the shoulder . then Gorgias flee to Marisa .     after Esdris and his man have be fight for a long time and be weary , Judas call upon the Lord to show himself their ally and leader in the battle .      then , raise a battle cry in his ancestral language , and with hymn , he charge Gorgias man when they be not expect it and put they to flight .    Expiation for the Dead .     Judas rally his army and go to the city of Adullam . as the seventh day be approach , they purify themselves accord to custom and keep the sabbath there .      on the follow day , since the task have now become urgent , Judas and his companion go to gather up the body of the fallen and bury they with their kindred in their ancestral tomb .      but under the tunic of each of the dead they find amulet sacred to the idol of Jamnia , which the law forbid the Jews to wear . so it be clear to all that this be why these man have fall .        they all therefore praise the way of the Lord , the just judge who bring to light the thing that be hide .       turn to supplication , they pray that the sinful deed might be fully blot out . the noble Judas exhort the people to keep themselves free from sin , for they have see with their own eye what have happen because of the sin of those who have fall .        he then take up a collection among all his soldier , amount to two thousand silver drachma , which he send to Jerusalem to provide for an expiatory sacrifice . in do this he act in a very excellent and noble way , inasmuch as he have the resurrection in mind ;      for if he be not expect the fallen to rise again , it would have be superfluous and foolish to pray for the dead .      but if he do this with a view to the splendid reward that await those who have go to rest in godliness , it be a holy and pious thought .      thus he make atonement for the dead that they might be absolve from their sin .
