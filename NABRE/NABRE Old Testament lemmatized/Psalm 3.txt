b ' threaten but Trusting   a psalm of David , when he flee from his son Absalom .      I   how many be my foe ,   Lord !   how many rise against I !    how many say of I ,   there be no salvation for he in God .   Selah   but you ,   Lord , be a shield around I ;   my glory , you keep my head high .     II   with my own voice I will call out to the   Lord ,   and he will answer I from his holy mountain . Selah   I lie down and I fall asleep ,   [ and ] I will wake up , for the   Lord   sustain I .    I do not fear , then , thousand of people   array against I on every side .    III   Arise ,   Lord ! save I , my God !   for you strike the cheekbone of all my foe ;   you break the tooth of the wicked .    Salvation be from the   Lord !   may your blessing be upon your people !   Selah             '
