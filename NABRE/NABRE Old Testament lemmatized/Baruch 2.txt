b '    so the   Lord   carry out the warning he have utter against we : against our judge , who govern Israel , against our king and prince , and against the people of Israel and Judah .      nowhere under heaven have anything be do like what he do in Jerusalem , as be write in the law of Moses :         that we would each eat    the flesh of our son , each the flesh of our daughter .      he have make we subject to all the kingdom around we , an object of reproach and horror among all the people around we , where the   Lord   have scatter we .        we be bring low , not raise high ,    because we sin against the   Lord , our God , not listen to his voice .     to the   Lord , our God , belong justice ; to we and to our ancestor , to be shameface , as on this day .        all the evil of which the   Lord   have warn we have come upon we .      we do not entreat the favor of the   Lord   by turn , each one , from the design of our evil heart .      the   Lord   keep watch over the evil , and bring they home to we ; for the   Lord   be just in all the work he command we to do ,        but we do not listen to his voice , or follow the precept of the   Lord   which he have set before we .    C. Prayer for Deliverance    and now ,   Lord , God of Israel , who lead your people out of the land of Egypt with a strong hand , with sign and wonder and great might , and with an upraised arm , so that you have make for yourself a name to the present day :        we have sin , we have commit sacrilege , we have violate all your statute ,   Lord , our God .        withdraw your anger from we , for we be leave few in number among the nation where you have scatter we .      hear ,   Lord , our prayer of supplication , and deliver we for your own sake : grant we favor in the sight of those who bring we into exile ,      that the whole earth may know that you be the   Lord , our God , and that Israel    and his descendant bear your name .        Lord , look down from your holy dwelling and take thought of we ;   Lord , incline your ear to hear we .        open your eye and see : it be not the dead in Hades ,    whose breath have be take from within they , who will declare the glory and vindication to the   Lord .        the person who be deeply grieve , who walk bow and feeble , with fail eye and famished soul , will declare your glory and justice ,   Lord !      not on the just deed of our ancestor and our king do we base our plea for mercy in your sight ,   Lord , our God .      you have send your wrath and anger upon we , as you have warn we through your servant the prophet :      thus say the   Lord : bend your neck and serve the king of Babylon , that you may continue in the land I give your ancestor ;         for if you do not listen to the   Lord s voice so as to serve the king of Babylon ,      I will silence from the city of Judah and from the street of Jerusalem the cry of joy and the cry of gladness , the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride ; and all the land shall be desert , without inhabitant .        but we do not listen to your voice , or serve the king of Babylon , and you carry out the threat you have make through your servant the prophet , that the bone of our king and the bone of our ancestor would be bring out from their burial place .        and indeed , they lie expose    to the heat of day and the frost of night . they die in great suffering , by famine and sword and plague .        and you reduce the house which bear your name    to what it be today , because of the wickedness of the house of Israel and the house of Judah .     Gods promises recall .     but with we , Lord , our God , you have deal in all your clemency and in all your great mercy .       thus you speak through your servant Moses , the day you order he to write down your law in the presence of the Israelites :      if you do not listen to my voice , surely this great and numerous throng will dwindle away among the nation to which I will scatter they .        for I know they will not listen to I , because they be a stiff - necked people . but in the land of their exile they shall have a change of heart ;        they shall know that I , the   Lord , be their God . I will give they a heart and ear that listen ;        and they shall praise I in the land of their exile , and shall remember my name .        then they shall turn back from their stiff - necked stubbornness , and from their evil deed , because they shall remember the way of their ancestor , who sin against the   Lord .        and I will bring they back to the land I promise on oath to their ancestor , to Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob ; and they shall rule it . I will make they increase ; they shall not be few .      and I will establish for they an eternal covenant : I will be their God , and they shall be my people ; and I will never again remove my people Israel from the land I give they .
