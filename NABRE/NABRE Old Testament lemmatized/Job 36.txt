b '    Elihu continue and say :     wait a little and I will instruct you ,   for there be still word to be say for God .   I will assemble argument from afar ,   and for my maker I will establish what be right .   for indeed , my word be not a lie ;   one perfect in knowledge be before you .   look , God be great , not disdainful ;   his strength of purpose be great . he do not preserve the life of the wicked .   he establish the right of the poor ;    he do not divert his eye from the just   but he seat they upon throne   with king , exalt forever .    if they be bind with fetter ,   hold fast by bond of affliction ,   he let they know what they have do ,   and how arrogant be their sin .   he open their ear to correction   and tell they to turn back from evil .   if they listen and serve he ,   they spend their day in prosperity ,   their year in happiness .   but if they do not listen , they pass to the grave ,   they perish for lack of knowledge .   the impious in heart lie up anger ;   they do not cry for help when he bind they ;   they will die young\xe2\x80\x94   their life    among the reprobate .   but he save the afflict through their affliction ,   and open their ear through oppression .    he entice you from distress ,   to a broad place without constraint ;   what rest on your table be rich food .   though you be full of the judgment of the wicked ,   judgment and justice will be maintain .   let not anger at abundance entice you ,   nor great bribery lead you astray .   will your wealth equip you against distress ,   or all your exertion of strength ?   do not long for the night ,   when people vanish in their place .   be careful ; do not turn to evil ;   for this you have prefer to affliction .    look , God be exalt in his power .   what teacher be there like he ?   who prescribe for he his way ?   who say , you have do wrong ?    remember , you should extol his work ,   which people have praise in song .   all humankind behold it ;   everyone view it from afar .   see , God be great beyond our knowledge ,   the number of his year past search out .   he hold in check the waterdrops   that filter in rain from his flood ,   till the cloud flow with they   and they rain down on all humankind .    can anyone understand the spread cloud ,   the thundering from his tent ?   look , he spread his light over it ,   it cover the root of the sea .   for by these he judge the nation ,   and give food in abundance .   in his hand he hold the lightning ,   and he command it to strike the mark .   his thunder announce he   and incite the fury of the storm .
