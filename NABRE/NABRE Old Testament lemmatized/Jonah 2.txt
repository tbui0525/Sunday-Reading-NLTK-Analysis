b '   Jonahs Prayer .     but the   Lord   send a great fish to swallow Jonah , and he remain in the belly of the fish three day and three night .        Jonah pray to the   Lord , his God , from the belly of the fish :      out of my distress I call to the   Lord ,   and he answer I ; from the womb of Sheol    I cry for help ,   and you hear my voice .    you cast I into the deep , into the heart of the sea ,   and the flood envelop I ; all your breaker and your billow   pass over I .    then I say , I be banish from your sight !   how will I again look upon your holy temple ?    the water surge around I up to my neck ;   the deep envelop I ;   seaweed wrap around my head .    I go down to the root of the mountain ;   to the land whose bar close behind I forever , but you bring my life up from the pit ,   O   Lord , my God .      when I become faint ,   I remember the   Lord ; my prayer come to you   in your holy temple .    those who worship worthless idol abandon their hope for mercy .    but I , with thankful voice ,   will sacrifice to you ; what I have vow I will pay :   deliverance be from the   Lord .      then the   Lord   command the fish to vomit Jonah upon dry land .
