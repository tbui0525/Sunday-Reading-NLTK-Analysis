b ' the Splendor of the Invincible City   a psalm of the Korahites .    a song .    I   Great be the   Lord   and highly praise   in the city of our God :   his holy mountain ,    fair of height ,   the joy of all the earth ,    Mount Zion , the height of Zaphon ,     the city of the great king .    II   God be in its citadel ,   renowned as a stronghold .   see ! the king assemble ,   together they advance .    when they look they be astounded ;   terrify , they be put to flight !    trembling seize they there ,   anguish , like a womans labor ,    as when the east wind wreck   the ship of Tarshish !     III    what we have hear we have now see   in the city of the   Lord   of host , in the city of our God ,   which God establish forever . Selah   we ponder , o God , your mercy   within your temple   like your name , o God ,   so be your praise to the end of the earth .   your right hand be fully victorious .    Mount Zion be glad ! the daughter of Judah rejoice   because of your judgment !     IV   go about Zion , walk all around it ,   note the number of its tower .   consider the rampart , examine its citadel ,   that you may tell future generation :    that this be God ,   our God for ever and ever .    he will lead we until death .
