b '     I be ready to respond to those who do not ask ,   to be find by those who do not seek I . I say : here I be ! here I be !   to a nation that do not invoke my name .    I have stretch out my hand all day   to a rebellious people , who walk in a way that be not good ,   follow their own design ;    a people who provoke I   continually to my face , offer sacrifice in garden   and burn incense on brick ,   sit in tomb   and spend the night in cave , eat the flesh of pig ,   with broth of unclean meat in their dish ;   cry out , hold back ,   do not come near I , lest I render you holy !   these thing be smoke in my nostril ,   a fire that burn all the day .   see , it stands write before I ;   I will not remain quiet until I have repay in full   your crime and the crime of your ancestor as well ,   say the   Lord . since they burn incense on the mountain ,   and insult I on the hill , I will at once pour out in full measure   their recompense into their lap .    Fate of the just and unjust in Israel     thus say the   Lord : as when the juice be press from a cluster ,   and someone say , do not destroy it ,   for there be still good in it , so will I do for the sake of my servant :   I will not destroy they all .   from Jacob I will bring forth offspring ,   from Judah , those who be to possess my mountain ; my choose one shall possess the land ,   my servant shall dwell there .   Sharon shall become a pasture for the flock ,   the Valley of Achor a rest place for the cattle ,   for my people who have seek I .    but you who forsake the   Lord ,   who forget my holy mountain , who spread a table for Fortune   and fill cup of mixed wine for Destiny ,    you I will destine for the sword ;   you shall all bow down for slaughter ; because I call and you do not answer ,   I speak and you do not listen , but do what be evil in my sight   and thing I do not delight in , you choose ,     therefore thus say the Lord   God : my servant shall eat ,   but you shall go hungry ; my servant shall drink ,   but you shall be thirsty ; my servant shall rejoice ,   but you shall be put to shame ;   my servant shall shout   for joy of heart , but you shall cry out for grief of heart ,   and howl for anguish of spirit .   you will leave your name for a curse to my choose one   when the Lord   God   slay you ,   and call his servant by another name .   whoever invoke a blessing in the land   shall bless by the God of truth ;   whoever take an oath in the land   shall swear by the God of truth ; for the hardship of the past shall be forget   and hide from my eye .    a World renew    see , I be create new heaven   and a new earth ; the former thing shall not be remember   nor come to mind .    instead , shout for joy and be glad forever   in what I be create . indeed , I be create Jerusalem to be a joy   and its people to be a delight ;   I will rejoice in Jerusalem   and exult in my people . no long shall the sound of weeping be hear there ,   or the sound of crying ;   no long shall there be in it   an infant who live but a few day ,   nor anyone who do not live a full lifetime ; one who die at a hundred year shall be consider a youth ,   and one who fall short of a hundred shall be think accursed .    they shall build house and live in they ,   they shall plant vineyard and eat their fruit ;   they shall not build and other live there ;   they shall not plant and other eat . as the year of a tree , so the year of my people ;   and my choose one shall long enjoy   the work of their hand .   they shall not toil in vain ,   nor beget child for sudden destruction ; for they shall be a people bless by the   Lord   and their descendant with they .   before they call , I will answer ;   while they be yet speak , I will hear .    the wolf and the lamb shall pasture together ,   and the lion shall eat hay like the ox\xe2\x80\x94   but the serpent food shall be dust .   none shall harm or destroy   on all my holy mountain , say the   Lord .
