b ' the Fate of Sinners and the Reward of the just   of David . Aleph do not be provoke by evildoer ;   do not envy those who do wrong .    like grass they wither quickly ;   like green plant they wilt away .     Beth   Trust in the   Lord   and do good   that you may dwell in the land    and live secure .    find your delight in the   Lord   who will give you your heart desire .     Gimel   Commit your way to the   Lord ;   trust in he and he will act    and make your righteousness shine like the dawn ,   your justice like noonday .     Daleth   be still before the   Lord ;   wait for he . do not be provoke by the prosperous ,   nor by malicious schemer .    he   Refrain from anger ; abandon wrath ;   do not be provoke ; it bring only harm .   those who do evil will be cut off ,   but those who wait for the   Lord   will inherit the earth .     Waw   Wait a little , and the wicked will be no more ;   look for they and they will not be there .   but the poor will inherit the earth ,    will delight in great prosperity .    Zayin   the wicked plot against the righteous   and gnash their tooth at they ;   but my Lord laugh at they ,    because he see that their day be come .    Heth   the wicked unsheath their sword ;   they string their bow to fall the poor and oppress ,   to slaughter those whose way be upright .    their sword will pierce their own heart ;   their bow will be break .    Teth   well the meagerness of the righteous one   than the plenty of the wicked .    the arm of the wicked will be break ,   while the   Lord   will sustain the righteous .    Yodh   the   Lord   know the day of the blameless ;   their heritage last forever .   they will not be ashamed when time be bad ;   in day of famine they will be satisfied .    Kaph   the wicked perish ,   enemy of the   Lord ; they shall be consume like fattened lamb ;   like smoke they disappear .     Lamedh   the wicked one borrow but do not repay ;   the righteous one be generous and give .   for those bless by the Lord will inherit the earth ,   but those accursed will be cut off .    Mem   the valiant one whose step be guide by the   Lord ,   who will delight in his way ,    may stumble , but he will never fall ,   for the   Lord   hold his hand .    Nun   neither in my youth , nor now in old age   have I see the righteous one abandon    or his offspring beg for bread .   all day long he be gracious and lend ,   and his offspring become a blessing .    Samekh   turn from evil and do good ,   that you may be settle forever .    for the   Lord   love justice   and do not abandon the faithful . Ayin when the unjust be destroy ,   and the offspring of the wicked cut off ,   the righteous will inherit the earth   and dwell in it forever .     Pe   the mouth of the righteous utter wisdom ;    his tongue speak what be right .   god teaching be in his heart ;    his step do not falter .    Sadhe   the wicked spy on the righteous   and seek to kill he .   but the   Lord   do not abandon he in his power ,   nor let he be condemn when try .    Qoph   wait eagerly for the   Lord ,   and keep his way ;   he will raise you up to inherit the earth ;   you will see when the wicked be cut off .    Resh   I have see a ruthless scoundrel ,   spread out like a green cedar .    when I pass by again , he be go ;   though I search , he could not be find .    Shin   observe the person of integrity and mark the upright ;   because there be a future for a man of peace .    sinner will be destroy together ;   the future of the wicked will be cut off .    Taw   the salvation of the righteous be from the   Lord ,   their refuge in a time of distress .    the   Lord   help and rescue they ,   rescue and save they from the wicked ,   because they take refuge in he .
