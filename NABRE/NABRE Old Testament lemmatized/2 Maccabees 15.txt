b '   Nicanors Arrogance .     when Nicanor learn that Judas and his companion be in the territory of Samaria , he decide he could attack they in complete safety on the day of rest .      the Jews who be force to accompany he plead , do not massacre they so savagely and barbarously , but show respect for the day which the all - seeing have exalt with holiness above all other day .      at this the thrice - accursed wretch ask if there be a ruler in heaven who prescribe the keeping of the sabbath day .        they reply , it be the live Lord , the ruler in heaven , who command the observance of the sabbath day .      then he say , I , the ruler on earth , command you to take up arm and carry out the king business . nevertheless he do not succeed in carry out his cruel plan .     in his utter boastfulness and arrogance Nicanor have determine to erect a public victory monument    over Judas and his companion .      but Maccabeus remain confident , fully convinced that he would receive help from the Lord .      he urge his man not to fear the attack of the Gentiles , but mindful of the help they have receive in the past from Heaven , to expect now the victory that would be give they by the Almighty .      by encourage they with word from the law and the prophet ,    and by remind they of the battle they have already win , he fill they with fresh enthusiasm .      having stir up their courage , he give his order and point out at the same time the perfidy of the Gentiles and their violation of oath .      when he have arm each of they , not so much with the security of shield and spear as with the encouragement of noble word , he cheer they all by relate a dream , a kind of wake vision , worthy of belief .     what he see be this : Onias , the former high priest ,    a noble and good man , modest in bearing , gentle in manner , distinguish in speech , and train from childhood in all that belong to excellence , be pray with outstretched arm for the whole jewish community .        then in the same way another man appear , distinguish by his white hair and dignity , and with an air of wondrous and majestic authority .      Onias then say of he , this be a man    who love his fellow Jews and fervently pray for the people and the holy city\xe2\x80\x94the prophet of God , Jeremiah .      stretch out his right hand , Jeremiah present a gold sword to Judas . as he give it to he he say ,      accept this holy sword as a gift from God ; with it you shall shatter your adversary .     encourage by Judas word , so noble and capable of instill valor and stir young heart to courage , they determine not merely to march , but to charge gallantly and decide the issue by hand - to - hand combat with the utmost courage , since city , sanctuary and temple be in danger .      they be not so much concerned about wife and child , or family and relation ; their first and foremost fear be for the consecrate sanctuary .        those who be leave in the city suffer no less an agony , anxious as they be about the battle in the open country .      everyone now await the decisive moment . the enemy be already draw near with their troop draw up in battle line , their beast place in strategic position , and their cavalry station on the flank .    Defeat of Nicanor .     Maccabeus , survey the host before he , the variety of weaponry , and the fierceness of their beast , stretch out his hand toward heaven and call upon the Lord who work wonder ; for he know that it be not weapon but the Lords decision that bring victory to those who deserve it .      call upon God , he speak in this manner : you , master , send your angel in the day of King Hezekiah of Judea , and he slew a hundred and eighty - five thousand man of Sennacheribs camp .        and now , Sovereign of the heaven , send a good angel to spread fear and tremble ahead of we .      by the might of your arm may those be strike down who have blasphemously come against your holy people ! with these word he end his prayer .      Nicanor and his troop advance to the sound of trumpet and battle song .      but Judas and his troop meet the enemy with supplication and prayer .      fight with their hand and pray to God with their heart , they lay low at least thirty - five thousand , and rejoice greatly over this manifestation of Gods power .      when the battle be over and they be joyfully depart , they discover Nicanor fall there in all his armor ;      so they raise tumultuous shout in their ancestral language in praise of the divine Sovereign .     then Judas , that man who be ever in body and soul the chief defender of his fellow citizen , and have maintain from youth his affection for his compatriot , order Nicanors head and right arm up to the shoulder to be cut off and take to Jerusalem .      when he arrive there , he assemble his compatriot , station the priest before the altar , and send for those in the citadel .        he show they the vile Nicanors head and the wretched blasphemer arm that have be boastfully stretch out against the holy dwelling of the Almighty .      he cut out the tongue of the godless Nicanor , say he would feed it piecemeal to the bird and would hang up the other wage of his folly opposite the temple .      at this , everyone look toward heaven and praise the Lord who manifest himself : bless be the one who have preserve undefile his own place !      Judas hang Nicanors head and arm on the wall of the citadel , a clear and evident sign to all of the Lords help .        by public vote it be unanimously decree never to let this day pass unobserved , but to celebrate the thirteenth day of the twelfth month , call Adar in Aramaic , the eve of Mordecais Day .       Compilers Apology .     since nicanor doing end in this way , with the city remain in the possession of the Hebrews from that time on , I will bring my story to an end here too .       if it be well write and to the point , that be what I want ; if it be poorly do and mediocre , that be the good I could do .      just as it be unpleasant to drink wine by itself or just water , whereas wine mix with water make a delightful and pleasing drink , so a skillfully compose story delight the ear of those who read the work . let this , then , be the end .
