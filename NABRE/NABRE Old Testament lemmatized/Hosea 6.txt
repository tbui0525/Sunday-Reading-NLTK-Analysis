b '     come , let we return to the   Lord ,   for it be he who have tear , but he will heal we ;   he have strike down , but he will bind our wound .   he will revive we after two day ;   on the third day    he will raise we up ,    to live in his presence .   let we know , let we strive to know the   Lord ;   as certain as the dawn be his coming . he will come to we like the rain ,   like spring rain that water the earth .      what can I do with you , Ephraim ?   what can I do with you , Judah ? your loyalty be like morning mist ,   like the dew that disappear early .   for this reason I strike they down through the prophet ,   I kill they by the word of my mouth ;     my judgment shine forth like the light .   for it be loyalty that I desire , not sacrifice ,   and knowledge of God rather than burn offering .     Further crime of Israel   but they , at Adam ,    violate the covenant ;   there they betray I .     Gilead    be a city of evildoer ,   track with blood .   like brigand lie in wait   be the band of priest . they murder on the road to Shechem ,    indeed they commit a monstrous crime .   in the house of Israel I have see a horrible thing :   there be find Ephraims prostitution ,   Israel be defile .   for you also , Judah ,   a harvest    have be appoint !
