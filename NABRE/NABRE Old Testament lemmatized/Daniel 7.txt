b ' ii . Daniels Visions   the Beasts and the judgment .      in the first year of King Belshazzar of Babylon , as Daniel lie in bed he have a dream , vision in his head . then he write down the dream ; the account begin :      in the vision I see during the night , suddenly the four wind of heaven stir up the great sea ,        from which emerge four immense beast ,    each different from the other .      the first be like a lion , but with eagle wing .    while I watch , the wing be pluck ; it be raise from the ground to stand on two foot like a human being , and give a human mind .      the second beast be like a bear ;    it be raise up on one side , and among the tooth in its mouth be three tusk . it be give the order , Arise , devour much flesh .      after this I look and see another beast , like a leopard ;    on its back be four wing like those of a bird , and it have four head . to this beast dominion be give .       after this , in the vision of the night I see a fourth beast , terrifying , horrible , and of extraordinary strength ; it have great iron tooth with which it devour and crush , and it trample with its foot what be leave . it differ from the beast that precede it . it have ten horn .      I be consider the ten horn it have , when suddenly another , a little horn , spring out of their midst , and three of the previous horn be tear away to make room for it . this horn have eye like human eye , and a mouth that speak arrogantly .       as I watch , Thrones be set up   and the Ancient of day take his throne . his clothing be white as snow ,   the hair on his head like pure wool ; his throne be flame of fire ,   with wheel of burn fire .   a river of fire surge forth ,   flow from where he sit ; thousand upon thousand be minister to he ,   and myriad upon myriad stand before he .   the court be convene , and the book be open .      I watch , then , from the first of the arrogant word which the horn speak , until the beast be slay and its body destroy and throw into the burn fire .      as for the other beast , their dominion be take away , but they be grant a prolongation of life for a time and a season .      as the vision during the night continue , I see come with the cloud of heaven   one like a son of man .   when he reach the Ancient of day   and be present before he ,   he receive dominion , splendor , and kingship ;   all nation , people and tongue will serve he . his dominion be an everlasting dominion   that shall not pass away ,   his kingship , one that shall not be destroy .      because of this , my spirit be anguish and I , Daniel , be terrify by my vision .      I approach one of those present and ask he the truth of all this ; in answer , he make known to I its meaning :      these four great beast stand for four king which shall arise on the earth .      but the holy one    of the most High shall receive the kingship , to possess it forever and ever .     then I wish to make certain about the fourth beast , so very terrible and different from the other , devour and crush with its iron tooth and bronze claw , and trample with its foot what be leave ;      and about the ten horn on its head , and the other one that spring up , before which three horn fall ; and about the horn with the eye and the mouth that speak arrogantly , which appear great than its fellow .      for , as I watch , that horn make war against the holy one and be victorious      until the Ancient of day come , and judgment be pronounce in favor of the holy one of the most high , and the time arrive for the holy one to possess the kingship .      he answer I thus : the fourth beast shall be a fourth kingdom on earth ,   different from all the other ; the whole earth it shall devour ,   trample down and crush .   the ten horn shall be ten king   rise out of that kingdom ;   another shall rise up after they , different from those before he ,   who shall lay low three king .   he shall speak against the most High   and wear down the holy one of the most high ,   intend to change the feast day and the law .   they shall be hand over to he   for a time , two time , and half a time .   but when the court be convene ,   and his dominion be take away   to be abolish and completely destroy ,   then the kingship and dominion and majesty   of all the kingdom under the heaven   shall be give to the people of the holy one of the most High , whose kingship shall be an everlasting kingship ,   whom all dominion shall serve and obey .     this be the end of the report . I , Daniel , be greatly terrify by my thought , and my face become pale , but I keep the matter to myself .              '
