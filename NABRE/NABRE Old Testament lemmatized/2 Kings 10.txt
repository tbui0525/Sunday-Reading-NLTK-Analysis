( the seventy prince be in the care of prominent man of the city , who be rear they . )     when the letter arrive , they take the prince and slew all seventy of they , put their head in basket , and send they to Jehu in Jezreel .      a messenger come in and tell he , they have bring the head of the prince . he say , pile they in two heap at the gate of the city until morning .     in the morning he come outside , stand there , and say to all the people : you be guiltless , for it be I who conspire against my lord and slew he . but who kill all these ?      know that not a single word which the   Lord   have speak against the house of Ahab shall fail . the   Lord   have accomplish what he decree through his servant Elijah .        ( and so Jehu slew all who be leave of the house of Ahab in Jezreel , as well as all his powerful supporter , intimate , and priest , leave he no survivor . )        then he go back inside . death of the Relatives of Ahaziah of Judah .   he set out for Samaria and , at Beth - eke - haroim on the way ,      Jehu come across relative of Ahaziah , king of Judah . who be you ? he ask , and they say , we be relative of Ahaziah . we be go down to visit the prince and the family of the queen mother .        take they alive , Jehu order . they be take alive , forty - two in number , then slay at the pit of Beth - eke . not one of they survive .     when he set out from there , Jehu meet Jehonadab , son of Rechab , on the road . he greet he and ask , be you with I wholeheartedly , as I be with you ? yes , he reply . if you be , give I your hand . he give he his hand , and he have he mount his chariot ,        and say , come with I and see my zeal for the   Lord . and they take he along in his chariot .    Slaughter of the Worshipers of Baal .     when he arrive in Samaria , Jehu slew all who be leave of Ahabs line in Samaria , do away with they completely , accord to the word the   Lord   speak to Elijah .     Jehu gather all the people together and say to they : Ahab serve Baal to some extent , but Jehu will serve he yet more .        now summon for I all Baals prophet , all his servant , and all his priest . see that no one be absent , for I have a great sacrifice for Baal . whoever be absent shall not live . this Jehu do as a ruse , so that he might destroy the servant of Baal .      Jehu say far , proclaim a solemn assembly in honor of Baal . they do so ,      and Jehu send word of it throughout all Israel . all the servant of Baal come ; there be no one who do not come ; they come to the temple of Baal , and it be fill from wall to wall .      then Jehu say to the custodian of the wardrobe , bring out garment for all the servant of Baal . when he have bring out the garment for they ,      Jehu , with Jehonadab , son of Rechab , enter the temple of Baal and say to the servant of Baal , Search and be sure that there be no one who serve the   Lord   here with you , but only servant of Baal .      then they proceed to offer sacrifice and burn offering . now Jehu have station eighty troop outside with this warning , any of you who let someone escape of those whom I shall deliver into your hand shall pay life for life .     as soon as he finish offer the burn offering , Jehu say to the guard and aide , go in and slay they . let no one escape . so the guard and aide put they to the sword and cast they out . afterward they go into the inner shrine of the temple of Baal ,      and take out the pillar of the temple of Baal . they burn the shrine ,      tear down the pillar of Baal , tear down the temple of Baal , and turn it into a latrine , as it remain today .     thus Jehu destroy Baal in Israel .    death of Jehu of Israel .     however , Jehu do not desist from the sin which Jeroboam , son of Nebat , have cause Israel to commit , the golden calf at Bethel and at Dan .      the   Lord   say to Jehu : because you have do well what be right in my eye , and have do to the house of Ahab all that be in my heart , your son to the fourth generation shall sit upon the throne of Israel .        but Jehu be not careful to walk in the law of the   Lord , the God of Israel , with all his heart , since he do not desist from the sin which Jeroboam have cause Israel to commit .       at that time the   Lord   begin to dismember Israel . Hazael defeat the Israelites throughout their territory      east of the Jordan ( all the land of Gilead , of the Gadites , Reubenites , and Manassites ) , from Aroer on the wadi Arnon up through Gilead and Bashan .     the rest of the act of Jehu , with all that he do and all his valor , be record in the book of the chronicle of the king of Israel .
