b ' Thanksgiving after sickness   for the leader . a psalm of David .    I   bless the one concerned for the poor ;    on a day of misfortune , the   Lord   deliver he .    the   Lord   keep and preserve he ,   make he bless in the land ,   and do not betray he to his enemy .   the   Lord   sustain he on his sickbed ,   you turn down his bedding whenever he be ill .     II   even I have say ,   Lord , take note of I ;   heal I , although I have sin against you .   my enemy say bad thing against I :   when will he die and his name be forget ?   when someone come to visit I , he speak without sincerity .   his heart store up malice ;   when he leave , he gossip .    all those who hate I whisper together against I ;   they imagine the bad about I :   he have have ruin pour over he ;   that one lie down will never rise again .    even my trusted friend ,   who eat my bread ,   have raise his heel against I .     III   but you ,   Lord , take note of I to raise I up   that I may repay they .      by this I will know you be pleased with I ,   that my enemy no long shout in triumph over I .   in my integrity may you support I   and let I stand in your presence forever .    bless be the   Lord , the God of Israel ,   from all eternity and forever .   amen . amen .
