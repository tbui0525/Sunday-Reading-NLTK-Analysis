b ' confidence in God during National Distress   for the leader ; accord to   Jeduthun . a psalm of Asaph .    I   I cry aloud to God ,   I cry to God to hear I .   on the day of my distress I seek the Lord ;   by night my hand be stretch out unceasingly ;    I refuse to be console .   when I think of God , I groan ;   as I meditate , my spirit grow faint .   Selah   you have keep I from close my eye in sleep ;   I be troubled and can not speak .   I consider the day of old ;   the year long past      I remember .   at night I ponder in my heart ;   and as I meditate , my spirit probe :   will the Lord reject we forever ,    never again show favor ?   have god mercy cease forever ?   the promise to go unfulfilled for future age ?   have God forget how to show mercy ,   in anger withhold his compassion ? Selah    I conclude : my sorrow be this ,   the right hand of the most High have abandon we .     II    I will recall the deed of the   Lord ;   yes , recall your wonder of old .    I will ponder all your work ;   on your exploit I will meditate .   your way , God , be holy ;   what god be as great as our God ?    you be the God who do wonder ;   among the people you have reveal your might .    with your mighty arm you redeem your people ,   the child of Jacob and Joseph .   Selah   the water see you , God ;   the water see you and lash about ,   even the deep of the sea    tremble .    the cloud pour down their rain ;   the thunderhead rumble ;   your arrow flash back and forth .    the thunder of your chariot wheel resound ;   your lightning light up the world ;   the earth tremble and quake .    through the sea be your way ;   your path , through the mighty water ,   though your footstep be unseen .    you lead your people like a flock   by the hand of Moses and Aaron .
