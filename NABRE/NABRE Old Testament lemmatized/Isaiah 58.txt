b '   reason for judgment    cry out full - throated and unsparingly ,   lift up your voice like a trumpet blast ; Proclaim to my people their transgression ,   to the house of Jacob their sin .    they seek I day after day ,   and desire to know my way , like a nation that have do what be just   and not abandon the judgment of their God ; they ask of I just judgment ,   they desire to draw near to God .   why do we fast , but you do not see it ?   afflict ourselves , but you take no note ? see , on your fast day you carry out your own pursuit ,   and drive all your laborer .    see , you fast only to quarrel and fight   and to strike with a wicked fist ! do not fast as you do today   to make your voice hear on high !   be this the manner of fast I would choose ,   a day to afflict oneself ? to bow one head like a reed ,   and lie upon sackcloth and ashe ? be this what you call a fast ,   a day acceptable to the   Lord ?     Authentic fast that lead to blessing    be this not , rather , the fast that I choose :   release those bind unjustly ,   untie the thong of the yoke ; set free the oppressed ,   break off every yoke ?    be it not share your bread with the hungry ,   bring the afflict and the homeless into your house ; clothing the naked when you see they ,   and not turn your back on your own flesh ?    then your light shall break forth like the dawn ,   and your wound shall quickly be heal ; your vindication shall go before you ,   and the glory of the   Lord   shall be your rear guard .   then you shall call , and the   Lord   will answer ,   you shall cry for help , and he will say : here I be ! if you remove the yoke from among you ,   the accuse finger , and malicious speech ;    if you lavish your food on the hungry   and satisfy the afflict ; then your light shall rise in the darkness ,   and your gloom shall become like midday ;   then the   Lord   will guide you always   and satisfy your thirst in parched place ,   will give strength to your bone and you shall be like a water garden ,   like a flow spring whose water never fail .    your people shall rebuild the ancient ruin ;   the foundation from age past you shall raise up ; Repairer of the breach , they shall call you ,   Restorer of ruin dwelling .     Authentic Sabbath Observance that lead to blessing    if you refrain from trample the sabbath ,   from follow your own pursuit on my holy day ; if you call the sabbath a delight ,   the   Lord s holy day glorious ; if you glorify it by not follow your way ,   seek your own interest , or pursue your own affairs\xe2\x80\x94   then you shall delight in the   Lord ,   and I will make you ride upon the height of the earth ; I will nourish you with the heritage of Jacob , your father ,   for the mouth of the   Lord   have speak .
