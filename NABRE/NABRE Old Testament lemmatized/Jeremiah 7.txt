b '    the Temple Sermon .      the word come to Jeremiah from the   Lord :      stand at the gate of the house of the   Lord   and proclaim this message there : hear the word of the   Lord , all you of Judah who enter these gate to worship the   Lord !      thus say the   Lord   of host , the God of Israel : reform your way and your deed so that I may dwell with you in this place .        do not put your trust in these deceptive word : the temple of the   Lord ! the temple of the   Lord ! the temple of the   Lord !        only if you thoroughly reform your way and your deed ; if each of you deal justly with your neighbor ;      if you no long oppress the alien ,    the orphan , and the widow ; if you no long shed innocent blood in this place or follow after other god to your own harm ,        only then will I let you continue to dwell in this place , in the land I give your ancestor long ago and forever .      but look at you ! you put your trust in deceptive word to your own loss !      do you think you can steal and murder , commit adultery and perjury , sacrifice to Baal , follow other god that you do not know ,        and then come and stand in my presence in this house , which bear my name , and say : we be safe ! we can commit all these abomination again ! ?        have this house which bear my name become in your eye a den of thief ? I have see it for myself!\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord .        go to my place at Shiloh ,    where I make my name dwell in the beginning . see what I do to it because of the wickedness of my people Israel .        and now , because you have commit all these deeds\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord \xe2\x80\x94because you do not listen , though I speak to you untiringly , and because you do not answer , though I call you ,      I will do to this house , which bear my name , in which you trust , and to the place which I give you and your ancestor , exactly what I do to Shiloh .        I will cast you out of my sight , as I cast away all your kindred , all the offspring of Ephraim .     abuse in Worship .     you , now , must not intercede for this people ! do not raise a cry or prayer in their behalf !    do not press I , for I will not listen to you !      do you not see what they be do in the city of Judah , in the street of Jerusalem ?      the child gather wood , their father light the fire , and the woman knead dough to make cake for the Queen of Heaven ,    while libation be pour out to other gods\xe2\x80\x94all to offend I !        be they really offend me\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord \xe2\x80\x94or rather themselves , to their own disgrace ?        therefore , thus say the Lord   God : my anger and my wrath will pour out upon this place , upon human being and beast , upon the tree of the field and the fruit of the earth ; it will burn and not be quench .      thus say the   Lord   of host , the God of Israel : Heap your burn offering upon your sacrifice ; eat up the meat !      in speak to your ancestor on the day I bring they out of the land of Egypt , I give they no command    concern burn offering or sacrifice .      this rather be what I command they : listen to my voice ; then I will be your God and you shall be my people . walk exactly in the way I command you , so that you may prosper .      but they do not listen to I , nor do they pay attention . they walk in the stubbornness of their evil heart and turn their back , not their face , to I .        from the day that your ancestor leave the land of Egypt even to this day , I keep on send all my servant the prophet to you .        yet they have not listen to I nor have they pay attention ; they have stiffen their neck and do bad than their ancestor .        when you speak all these word to they , they will not listen to you either . when you call to they , they will not answer you .      say to they : this be the nation which do not listen to the voice of the   Lord , its God , or take correction . Faithfulness have disappear ; the word itself be banish from their speech .      cut off your hair    and throw it away !   on the height raise a lament ; the   Lord   have indeed reject and cast off   the generation that draw down his wrath .     the people of Judah have do what be evil in my eyes\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord . they have set up their detestable thing in the house which bear my name , thereby defile it .        in the Valley of Ben - hinnom    they go on build the high place of Topheth to sacrifice their son and daughter by fire , something I never command or consider .      be assure ! day be coming\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord \xe2\x80\x94when they will no long say Topheth or Valley of Ben - hinnom but Valley of Slaughter . for want of space , Topheth will become burial ground .        the corpse of this people will be food for the bird of the sky and beast of the earth , which no one will drive away .        I will silence the cry of joy , the cry of gladness , the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride , in the city of Judah and in the street of Jerusalem ; for the land will be turn to rubble .
