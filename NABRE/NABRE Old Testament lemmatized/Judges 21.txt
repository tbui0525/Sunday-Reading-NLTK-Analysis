b '   ensure a future for Benjamin .      the man of Israel take an oath at Mizpah : none of we will give his daughter in marriage to anyone from Benjamin .      so the people go to Bethel and remain there before God until evening , raise their voice in bitter weeping .        they say ,   Lord , God of Israel , why have this happen in Israel that today one tribe of Israel should be lack ?      early the next day the people build an altar there and offer burn offering and communion offering .      then the Israelites ask , be there any among all the tribe of Israel who do not come up to the   Lord   for the assembly ? for there be a solemn oath that anyone who do not go up to the   Lord   at Mizpah should be put to death .      the Israelites be disconsolate over their brother Benjamin and say , today one tribe have be cut off from Israel .      what can we do about wife for the survivor , since we have swear by the   Lord   not to give they any of our daughter in marriage ?      and when they ask , be there one among the tribe of Israel who do not come up to the   Lord   in Mizpah ? they find that none of the man of Jabesh - gilead have come to the encampment for the assembly .      a roll call of the people be take , and none of the inhabitant of Jabesh - gilead    be present .      so the assembly send twelve thousand warrior there with order , go put the inhabitant of Jabesh - gilead to the sword .      this be what you be to do : every male and every woman who have have relation with a male you shall put under the ban .         find among the inhabitant of Jabesh - gilead four hundred young virgin woman , who have not have relation with a man , they bring they to the camp at Shiloh , in the land of Canaan .        then the whole assembly send word to the Benjaminites at the crag of Rimmon ,    offer they peace .       so Benjamin return at that time , and they be give as wife the woman of Jabesh - gilead who have be spare ; but these prove to be not enough for they .     the people have regret about Benjamin because the   Lord   have make a breach among the tribe of Israel .        the elder of the assembly say , what shall we do for wife for the survivor ? for the woman of Benjamin have be annihilate .        they say , there must be heir for the survivor of Benjamin , so that a tribe will not be wipe out from Israel .      yet we can not give they any of our daughter in marriage . for the Israelites have take an oath , curse be he who give a wife to Benjamin !      then they think of the yearly feast of the   Lord   at Shiloh ,    north of Bethel , east of the highway that go up from Bethel to Shechem , and south of Lebonah .      and they instruct the Benjaminites , go and set an ambush in the vineyard .      when you see the woman of Shiloh come out to join in the dance , come out of the vineyard and catch a wife for each of you from the woman of Shiloh ; then go on to the land of Benjamin .      when their father or their brother come to complain to we , we shall say to they , release they to we as a kindness , since we do not take a woman for every man in battle . nor do you yourselves give your daughter to they , thus incur guilt .      the Benjaminites do this ; they carry off wife for each of they from the dancer they have seize , and they go back each to his own heritage , where they rebuild the city and settle they .      at that time the Israelites disperse from there for their own tribe and clan ; they set out from there each to his own heritage .      in those day there be no king in Israel ; everyone do what be right in their own sight .
