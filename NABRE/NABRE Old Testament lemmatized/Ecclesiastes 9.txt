b '   chapter 9   all this I have keep in my heart and all this I examine : the just , the wise , and their deed be in the hand of God . love from hatred    mortal can not tell ; both be before they .       everything be the same for everybody : the same lot for the just and the wicked , for the good , for the clean and the unclean , for the one who offer sacrifice and the one who do not . as it be for the good , so it be for the sinner ; as it be for the one who take an oath , so it be for the one who fear an oath .      among all the thing that be do under the sun , this be the bad , that there be one lot for all . hence the heart of human being be fill with evil , and madness be in their heart during life ; and afterward\xe2\x80\x94to the dead !     for whoever be choose among all the living have hope : a live dog    be well off than a dead lion .       for the living know that they be to die , but the dead no long know anything . there be no further recompense for they , because all memory of they be lose .      for they , love and hatred and rivalry have long since perish . never again will they have part in anything that be do under the sun .      go , eat your bread    with joy and drink your wine with a merry heart , because it be now that God favor your work .      at all time let your garment be white , and spare not the perfume for your head .      enjoy life with the wife you love , all the day of the vain life grant you under the sun . this be your lot in life , for the toil of your labor under the sun .      anything you can turn your hand to , do with what power you have ; for there will be no work , no planning , no knowledge , no wisdom in Sheol where you be go .    the Time of Misfortune be not know .     again I see under the sun that the race be not win by the swift , nor the battle by the valiant , nor a livelihood by the wise , nor rich by the shrewd , nor favor by the expert ; for a time of misfortune come to all alike .      human being no more know their own time than fish take in the fatal net or bird trap in the snare ; like these , mortal be catch when an evil time suddenly fall upon they .    the Uncertain Future and the Sages .     on the other hand I see this wise deed under the sun , which I think magnificent .      against a small city with few inhabitant advance a mighty king , who surround it and throw up great siegework about it .      but in the city live a man who , though poor , be wise , and he deliver it through his wisdom . yet no one remember this poor man .       though I have say , Wisdom be well than force , yet the wisdom of the poor man be despise and his word go unheeded .     the quiet word of the wise be well heed   than the shout of a ruler of fool .   wisdom be well than weapon of war ,   but one bungler destroy much good .
