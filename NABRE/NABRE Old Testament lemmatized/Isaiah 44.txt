b '    hear then , Jacob , my servant ,   Israel , whom I have choose .   thus say the   Lord   who make you ,   your help , who form you from the womb : do not fear , Jacob , my servant ,   Jeshurun ,    whom I have choose .   I will pour out water upon the thirsty ground ,   stream upon the dry land ; I will pour out my spirit upon your offspring ,   my blessing upon your descendant .   they shall spring forth amid grass   like poplar beside flow water .    one shall say , I be the   Lord s ,   another shall be name after Jacob , and this one shall write on his hand ,    the   Lord s ,   and receive the name Israel .     the true God and false god    thus say the   Lord , Israels king ,   its redeemer , the   Lord   of host : I be the first , I be the last ;   there be no God but I .     who be like I ? let he stand up and declare ,   make it evident , and confront I with it . who of old announce future event ?   let they foretell to we the thing to come .   do not fear or be trouble . do I not announce it to you long ago ?   I declare it , and you be my witness . be there any God but I ?   there be no other Rock ,    I know of none !       those who fashion idol be all nothing ;   their precious work be of no avail . they be their witness :    they see nothing , know nothing ,   and so they be put to shame .    who would fashion a god or cast an idol ,   that be of no use ?   look , all its company will be shame ;   they be artisan , mere human being ! they all assemble and stand there ,   only to cower in shame .   the ironsmith fashion a likeness ,   he work it over the coal , shape it with hammer ,   work it with his strong arm . with hunger his strength wane ,   without water , he grow faint .    the woodworker stretch a line ,   and mark out a shape with a stylus . he shape it with scrape tool ,   with a compass measure it off , make it the copy of a man ,    human display , enthrone in a shrine .   he go out to cut down cedar ,   take a holm tree or an oak . he pick out for himself tree of the forest ,   plant a fir , and the rain make it grow .   it be use for fuel :   with some of the wood he warm himself ,   make a fire and bake bread . yet he make a god and worship it ,   turn it into an idol and adore it !   half of it he burn in the fire ,   on its ember he roast meat ;   he eat the roast and be full . he warm himself and say , ah !   I be warm ! I see the flame !   the rest of it he make into a god ,   an image to worship and adore . he pray to it and say ,   help I ! you be my god !   they do not know , do not understand ;   their eye be too clouded to see ,   their mind , to perceive .   he do not think clearly ;   he lack the wit and knowledge to say , half the wood I burn in the fire ,   on its ember I bake bread ,   I roast meat and eat . shall I turn the rest into an abomination ?   shall I worship a block of wood ?   he be chase ashe !   a deluded mind have lead he astray ;   he can not save himself ,   do not say , this thing in my right hand\xe2\x80\x94is it not a fraud ?     remember these thing , Jacob ,   Israel , for you be my servant ! I form you , a servant to I ;   Israel , you shall never be forget by I :   I have brush away your offense like a cloud ,   your sin like a mist ;   return to I , for I have redeem you .     raise a glad cry , you heavens\xe2\x80\x94the   Lord   have act !   Shout , you depth of the earth . break forth , mountain , into song ,   forest , with all your tree . for the   Lord   have redeem Jacob ,   show his glory through Israel .    Cyrus , anoint of the Lord , Agent of Israels Liberation   thus say the   Lord , your redeemer ,   who form you from the womb : I be the   Lord , who make all thing ,   who alone stretch out the heavens ,   I spread out the earth by myself .    I bring to nought the omen of babbler ,   make fool of diviner , turn back the wise   and make their knowledge foolish .   I confirm the word of my servant ,   carry out the plan my messenger announce . I say to Jerusalem , be inhabit !   to the city of Judah , be rebuild !   I will raise up their ruin .   I say to the deep , be dry !   I will dry up your river .    I say of Cyrus ,    my shepherd !   he carry out my every wish , say of Jerusalem , let it be rebuild ,   and of the temple , lay its foundation .              '
