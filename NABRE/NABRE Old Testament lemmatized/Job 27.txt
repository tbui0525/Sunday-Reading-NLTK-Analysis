b '   Jobs Reply .     Job take up his theme again and say :     as God live ,    who take away my right ,    the Almighty , who have make my life bitter ,   so long as I still have life breath in I ,   the breath of God in my nostril ,   my lip shall not speak falsehood ,   nor my tongue utter deceit !   far be it from I to account you right ;   till I die I will not renounce my innocence .    my justice I maintain and I will not relinquish it ;   my heart do not reproach I for any of my day .    let my enemy be as the wicked   and my adversary as the unjust !   for what hope have the impious when he be cut off ,   when God require his life ?   will God then listen to his cry   when distress come upon he ,   if he delight in the Almighty   and call upon God constantly ?   I will teach you what be in Gods hand ,   and the way of the Almighty I will not conceal .   look , you yourself have all see it ;   why do you spend yourself in empty word !   this be the portion of the wicked with God ,   the heritage oppressor receive from the Almighty :    though his child be many , the sword await they .   his descendant shall want for bread .   his survivor shall be bury in death ;   their widow shall not weep .   though he heap up silver like dust   and store away mound of clothing ,   what he have store the righteous shall wear ,   and the innocent shall divide the silver .   he build his house as of cobwebs ,   or like a booth put up by a watchman .   he lie down a rich man , one last time ;   he open his eyes\xe2\x80\x94nothe be there .    terror flood over he like water ,   at night the tempest carry he off .   the east wind seize he and he be go ;   it sweep he from his place ;   it hurl itself at he without pity ,   as he try to flee from its power .   it clap its hand at he ,   and whistle at he from its place .
