b '   plot against Nehemiah .     when it have be report to Sanballat , Tobiah , Geshem the Arab , and our other enemy that I have rebuild the wall and that there be no breach leave in it ( though up to that time I have not yet set up the door in the gate ) ,      Sanballat and Geshem send I this message : come , let we hold council together at Chephirim in the plain of Ono . they be plan to do I harm .      I send messenger to they with this reply : I be engage in a great enterprise and be unable to come down . why should the work stop , while I leave it to come down to you ?      four time they send I this same proposal , and each time I give the same reply .      then , the fifth time , Sanballat send I the same message by one of his servant , who bear an unsealed letter      contain this text : among the nation it have be reported\xe2\x80\x94Gashmu    be witness to this\xe2\x80\x94that you and the Jews be plan a rebellion ; that for this reason you be rebuild the wall ; and that you be to be their king .      also , that you have set up prophet in Jerusalem to proclaim you king of Judah . now , since matter like these will reach the ear of the king , come , let we hold council together .      I send he this answer : nothing of what you report be happen ; rather , it be the invention of your own mind .      they be all try to intimidate we , think , they will be discourage from continue with the work , and it will never be complete . but instead , I then redouble my effort .     I go to the house of Shemaiah , son of Delaiah , son of Mehetabel , who be confine to his house , and he say : let we meet in the house of God , inside the temple building ; let we lock the door of the temple . for they be come to kill you\xe2\x80\x94by night they be come to kill you .      my answer be : a man like I take flight ? should a man like I enter the temple to save his life ? I will not go !      for on consideration , it be plain to I that God have not send he ; rather , because Tobiah and Sanballat have bribe he , he voice this prophecy concern I ,      that I might act on it out of fear and commit this sin . then they would have have a shameful story with which to discredit I .       keep in mind Tobiah and Sanballat , my God , because of these thing they do ; keep in mind as well Noadiah the woman prophet and the other prophet who be try to intimidate I .    Completion of the work .     the wall be finish on the twenty - fifth day of Elul ;    the work have take fifty - two day .       when all our enemy have hear of this , and all the neighbor Gentiles round about have take note of it , they be very discouraged , for they know that it be with our Gods help that this work have be complete .      at that same time , however , many letter be go to Tobiah from the noble of Judah , and Tobiahs letter be reach they ,      for many in Judah be in league with he , since he be the son - in - law of Shecaniah , son of Arah , and his son Jehohanan have marry the daughter of Meshullam , son of Berechiah .      they would praise his good deed in my presence and relate to he whatever I say ; and Tobiah send letter try to intimidate I .
