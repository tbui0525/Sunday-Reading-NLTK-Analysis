b '    why be time not set by the Almighty ,   and why do his friend not see his day ?    People remove landmark ;   they steal herd and pasture they .   the donkey of orphan they drive away ;   they take the widow ox for a pledge .   they force the needy off the road ;   all the poor of the land be drive into hiding .   like wild donkey in the wilderness ,   they go forth to their task of seek prey ;   the steppe provide food for their young ;   they harvest fodder in the field ,   and glean in the vineyard of the wicked .   they pass the night naked , without clothing ;   they have no covering against the cold ;   they be drench with rain from the mountain ,   and for want of shelter they cling to the rock .   Orphans be snatch from the breast ,   infant of the needy be take in pledge .    they go about naked , without clothing ,   and famished , they carry the sheaf .    between the row they press out the oil ;   they tread the wine press , yet be thirsty .   in the city the die groan ,   and the soul of the wounded cry out .   yet God do not treat it as a disgrace !   they be rebel against the light :    they do not recognize its way ;   they do not stay in its path .   when there be no light the murderer rise ,   to kill the poor and needy ;   in the night he act like a thief .   the eye of the adulterer watch for the twilight ;    he say , no eye will see I . he put a mask over his face ;    in the dark he break into house ; by day they shut themselves in ;   they do not know the light .   indeed , for all of they morning be deep darkness ;   then they recognize the terror of deep darkness .   he be swift on the surface of the water :    their portion in the land be accurse ,   they do not turn aside by way of the vineyard .   Drought and heat snatch away the snow water ,   Sheol , those who have sin .   may the womb forget he ,   may the worm find he sweet ,   may he no long be remember ; and may wickedness be break like a tree .   may his companion be barren , unable to give birth ,   may his widow not prosper !   he    sustain the mighty by his strength ,   to he who rise without assurance of his life    he give safety and support ,   and his eye be on their way .   they be exalt for a while , and then be no more ;   lay low , like everyone else they be gather up ;   like ear of grain they shrivel .   if this be not so , who can make I a liar ,   and reduce my word to nothing ?
