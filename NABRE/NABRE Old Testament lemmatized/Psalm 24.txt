b ' the glory of God in Procession to Zion   a psalm of David . I the earth be the   Lord s and all it hold ,    the world and those who dwell in it .   for he found it on the sea ,   establish it over the river .     II   who may go up the mountain of the   Lord ?    who can stand in his holy place ?    the clean of hand and pure of heart ,   who have not give his soul to useless thing ,   what be vain .   he will receive blessing from the   Lord ,   and justice from his save God .   such be the generation that seek he ,   that seek the face of the God of Jacob . Selah    III   lift up your head , o gate ;    be lift , you ancient portal ,   that the king of glory may enter .    who be this king of glory ?   the   Lord , strong and mighty ,   the   Lord , mighty in war .   lift up your head , o gate ;   rise up , you ancient portal ,   that the king of glory may enter .   who be this king of glory ?   the   Lord   of host , he be the king of glory . Selah             '
