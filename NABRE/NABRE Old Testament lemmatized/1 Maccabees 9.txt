b '   death of Judas .     when Demetrius hear that Nicanor and his army have fall in battle , he again send Bacchides and Alcimus into the land of Judah , along with the right wing of his army .      they take the road to Galilee , and camping opposite the ascent at Arbela , they capture it    and kill many people .      in the first month of the one hundred and fifty - second year ,    they encamp against Jerusalem .      then they set out for Berea with twenty thousand man and two thousand cavalry .      Judas , with three thousand pick man , have camp at Elasa .      when they see the great number of the troop , they be very much afraid , and many slip away from the camp , until only eight hundred of they remain .     when Judas see that his army be melt away just as the battle be imminent , he be brokenhearted , because he have no time to gather they together .      in spite of his discouragement he say to those who remain : let we go forward to meet our enemy ; perhaps we can put up a good fight against they .      they try to dissuade he , say : we certainly can not . let we save our own life now , and come back with our kindred , and then fight against they . now we be too few .      but Judas say : far be it from I to do such a thing as to flee from they ! if our time have come , let we die bravely for our kindred and not leave a stain upon our honor !     then the army of Bacchides move out of camp and take its position for combat . the cavalry be divide into two squadron , and the slinger and the archer come on ahead of the army , and in the front line be all the good warrior . bacchide be on the right wing .      flank by the two squadron , the phalanx attack as they blow their trumpet . those who be on Judas side also blow their trumpet .      the earth shake with the noise of the army , and the battle rage from morning until evening .     when Judas see that Bacchides be on the right , with the main force of his army , all the most stouthearte rally to he ,      and the right wing be crush ; Judas pursue they as far as the mountain slope .        but when those on the left wing see that the right wing be crush , they close in behind Judas and those with he .      the battle become intense , and many on both side fall wound .      then Judas fall , and the rest flee .     Jonathan and Simon take their brother Judas and bury he in the tomb of their ancestor at Modein .      all Israel weep for he with great lamentation . they mourn for he many day , and they say ,      how the mighty one have fall , the savior of Israel !        the other act of Judas , his battle , the brave deed he perform , and his greatness have not be record ; but they be very many .     Jonathan succeed Judas .     after the death of Judas , the lawless raise their head in every part of Israel , and all kind of evildoer appear .      in those day there be a very great famine , and the country desert to they .      bacchide choose renegade and make they master of the country .      these seek out and hunt down the friend of Judas and bring they to Bacchides , who punish and deride they .      there be great tribulation in Israel , the like of which have not be since the time prophet cease to appear among they .     then all the friend of Judas come together and say to Jonathan :      ever since your brother Judas die , there have be no one like he to lead we against our enemy , both Bacchides and those of our nation who be hostile to we .      now therefore we have choose you today to be our ruler and leader in his place , to fight our battle .      from that moment Jonathan accept the leadership , and take the place of Judas his brother .    Bacchides Pursues Jonathan .     when Bacchides learn of it , he seek to kill he .      but Jonathan and his brother Simon and all who be with he discover this , and they flee to the wilderness of Tekoa    and camp by the water of the pool of Asphar .     [   ]      Jonathan send his brother    as leader of the convoy to implore his friend , the Nabateans , to let they deposit with they their great quantity of baggage .        but the tribe of Jambri from Medaba    make a raid and seize and carry off John and everything he have .     after this , word be bring to Jonathan and his brother Simon : the tribe of Jambri be celebrate a great wedding , and with a large escort they be bring the bride , the daughter of one of the great prince of Canaan , from Nadabath .      remember the blood of John their brother , they go up and hide themselves under cover of the mountain .      as they watch there appear a noisy throng with much baggage ; then the bridegroom and his friend and kinsman have come out to meet they with tambourine and musician with their instrument .      Jonathan and his party rise up against they from their ambush and kill they . many fall wound ; the rest flee toward the mountain ; all their spoil be take .      thus the wedding be turn into mourning , and the sound of their music into lamentation .      having take their revenge for the blood of their brother , they return to the marsh of the Jordan .     when bacchide hear of it , he come on the sabbath to the bank of the Jordan with a large force .      then Jonathan say to his companion , let we rise up now and fight for our life , for today be not like yesterday and the day before .      the battle be before we , behind we be the water of the Jordan , on either side of we , marsh and thicket ; there be no way of escape .        cry out now to Heaven so that you may be deliver from the hand of our enemy .      when they join battle , Jonathan raise his hand to strike bacchide , but bacchide back away from he .      Jonathan and those with he jump into the Jordan and swim across to the other side , but the enemy do not pursue they across the Jordan .      about a thousand man on Bacchides side fall that day .     on return to Jerusalem , Bacchides build stronghold in Judea : the Jericho fortress , as well as Emmaus , Beth - horon , Bethel , Timnath , Pharathon , and Tephon , with high wall and gate and bar .        in each he put a garrison to harass Israel .      he fortify the city of Beth - zur , Gazara and the citadel , and put troop in they and store of provision .      he take as hostage the son of the lead people of the country and put they in custody in the citadel at Jerusalem .      in the one hundred and fifty - third year , in the second month ,    Alcimus order the wall of the inner court of the sanctuary to be tear down , thus destroy the work of the prophet . but he only begin to tear it down .      just at that time Alcimus be stricken , and his work be interrupt ; his mouth be close and he be paralyze , so that he could no long utter a word or give order concern his household .      Alcimus die in great agony at that time .      see that Alcimus be dead , Bacchides return to the king , and the land of Judah be at rest for two year .     then all the lawless take counsel and say : Jonathan and those with he be live in peace and security . now then , let we have Bacchides return , and he will capture all of they in a single night .      so they go and take counsel with he .      when Bacchides be set out with a large force , he send letter secretly to all his ally in Judea , tell they to seize Jonathan and his companion . they be not able to do this , however , because their plan become know .      in fact , Jonathans man seize about fifty of the man of the country who be leader in the conspiracy and put they to death .     then Jonathan and those with he , along with Simon , withdraw to Bethbasi    in the wilderness ; he rebuild its ruin and fortify it .      when Bacchides learn of this , he gather together his whole force and send word to those who be in Judea .      he come and camp before Bethbasi , and construct siege engine , he fight against it for many day .     leave his brother Simon in the city , Jonathan , accompany by a small group of man , go out into the countryside .      he strike down Odomera and his kindred and the tribe of Phasiron in their encampment ; these man have begin to attack and they be go up with their force .      Simon and those with he then sally forth from the city and set fire to the siege engine .      they fight against Bacchides , and he be crush . they cause he great distress , because the enterprise he have plan be in vain .      he be enrage with the lawless man who have advise he to invade the province . he kill many of they and resolve to return to his own country .     Jonathan learn of this and send ambassador to agree on peace with he and to obtain the release of the prisoner .      he agree to do as Jonathan ask . he swear an oath to he that he would never try to do he any harm for the rest of his life ;      and he release to he the prisoner he have previously take from the land of Judah . thereupon he return to his own land and never come into their territory again .      then the sword cease from Israel . Jonathan settle in Michmash ;    he begin to judge the people and he eliminate the renegade from Israel .             '
