b '   description of Judith .       now in those day Judith , daughter of Merari ,    son of Ox , son of Joseph , son of Oziel , son of Elkiah , son of Ananias , son of Gideon , son of Raphain , son of Ahitub , son of Elijah , son of Hilkiah , son of Eliab , son of Nathanael , son of Salamiel , son of Sarasadai , son of Simeon , son of Israel , hear of this .      her husband , Manasseh ,    of her own tribe and clan , have die at the time of the barley harvest .      while he be supervise those who bind the sheaf in the field , he be overcome by the heat ; and he collapse on his bed and die in Bethulia , his native city . he be bury with his ancestor in the field between Dothan and Balamon .       Judith be live as a widow    in her home for three year and four month .      she set up a tent for herself on the roof of her house , put sackcloth about her waist , and wear widow clothing .        she fast all the day of her widowhood , except sabbath eve and sabbath , new moon eve and new moon , feastday and holiday of the house of Israel .        she be beautiful in appearance and very lovely to behold .    her husband , Manasseh , have leave her gold and silver , male and female servant , livestock and field , which she be maintain .      no one have a bad word to say about she , for she fear God greatly . Judith and the Elders .        so when Judith hear of the harsh word that the people , discourage by their lack of water , have speak against their ruler , and of all that Uzziah have say to they in reply , swear that he would hand over the city to the Assyrians at the end of five day ,      she send her maid who be in charge of all her thing    to summon Uzziah , Chabris , and Charmis , the elder of her city .      when they come , she say to they : listen to I , you ruler of the people of Bethulia . what you say to the people today be not right . you pronounce this oath , make between God and yourself , and promise to hand over the city to our enemy unless within a certain time the Lord come to our aid .      who be you to put God to the test today , set yourself in the place of God in human affair ?         and now it be the Lord Almighty you be put to the test , but you will never understand anything !      you can not plumb the depth of the human heart or grasp the working of the human mind ; how then can you fathom God , who have make all these thing , or discern his mind , or understand his plan ?   no , my brother , do not anger the Lord our God .       for if he do not plan to come to our aid within the five day , he have it equally within his power to protect we at such time as he please , or to destroy we in the sight of our enemy .      do not impose condition on the plan of the Lord our God . God be not like a human be to be move by threat , nor like a mortal to be cajole .     so while we wait for the salvation that come from he , let we call upon he to help we , and he will hear our cry if it please he .      for there have not rise among we in recent generation , nor do there exist today , any tribe , or clan , or district , or city of our that worship god make by hand , as happen in former day .        it be for such conduct that our ancestor be hand over to the sword and to pillage , and fall with great destruction before our enemy .        but since we acknowledge no other god but the Lord , we hope that he will not disdain we or any of our people .      if we be take , then all Judea will fall , our sanctuary will be plunder , and God will demand an account from we for their profanation .      for the slaughter of our kindred , for the taking of exile from the land , and for the devastation of our inheritance , he will hold we responsible among the nation . wherever we be enslave , we will be a scandal and a reproach in the eye of our master .      our servitude will not work to our advantage , but the Lord our God will turn it to disgrace .     therefore , my brother , let we set an example    for our kindred . their life depend on we , and the defense of the sanctuary , the temple , and the altar rest with we .       besides all this , let we give thank to the Lord our God for put we to the test as he do our ancestor .        Recall how he deal with Abraham , and how he test Isaac , and all that happen to Jacob in Syrian Mesopotamia while he be tend the flock of Laban , his mother brother .      he have not test we with fire , as he do they , to try their heart , nor be he take vengeance on we . but the Lord chastise those who be close to he in order to admonish they .     then Uzziah say to she : all that you have say you have speak truthfully , and no one can deny your word .      for today be not the first time your wisdom have be evident , but from your early day all the people have recognize your understanding , for your heart disposition be right .      the people , however , be so thirsty that they force we to do for they as we have promise , and to bind ourselves by an oath that we can not break .         but now , since you be a devout woman , pray for we that the Lord may send rain to fill up our cistern . then we will no long be faint from thirst .     then Judith say to they : listen to I ! I will perform a deed that will go down from generation to generation among our descendant .      stand at the city gate tonight to let I pass through with my maid ; and within the day you have specify before you will surrender the city to our enemy , the Lord will deliver Israel by my hand .      you must not inquire into the affair , for I will not tell you what I be do until it have be accomplish .      Uzziah and the ruler say to she , go in peace , and may the Lord God go before you to take vengeance upon our enemy !      then they withdraw from the tent and return to their post .             '
