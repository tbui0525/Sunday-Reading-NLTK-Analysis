b ' Norm of life for ruler   a psalm of David . I I sing of mercy and justice ;   to you ,   Lord , I sing praise .   I study the way of integrity ;    when will you come to I ? I act with integrity of heart   within my household .     I do not allow into my presence anything base .   I hate wrongdoing ;   I will have no part of it .    may the devious heart keep far from I ;   the wicked I will not acknowledge .   whoever slander a neighbor in secret   I will reduce to silence .   haughty eye and arrogant heart    I can not endure .    II   I look to the faithful of the land    to sit at my side . whoever follow the way of integrity    be the one to enter my service .   no one who practice deceit   can remain within my house . no one who speak falsely   can last in my presence .     morning after morning I clear all the wicked from the land ,   to rid the city of the   Lord   of all doer of evil .
