b '   allegory of the Pot .      on the tenth day of the tenth month , in the ninth year ,    the word of the   Lord   come to I :        Son of man , write down todays date this very day , for on this very day the king of Babylon lay siege to Jerusalem .       propose this parable to the rebellious house and say to they : thus say the Lord   God : put the pot on , put it on !   Pour in some water ;   add to it piece of meat ,   all choice piece ; with thigh and shoulder ,   with choice cut fill it .   choose the pick of the flock ,   then pile log beneath it ; bring it to a boil ,   cook all the piece in it .    therefore thus say the Lord   God :   Woe to the city full of blood !   a pot contain filth ,   whose filth can not be remove ! take out its piece one by one ,   for no lot have fall on their behalf .   for her blood be still in her midst ;   on a bare rock she leave it ; she do not pour it on the ground   to be cover with dirt .    to arouse wrath , to exact vengeance ,   I have leave her blood on bare rock   not to be cover .   therefore , thus say the Lord   God : woe to the city full of blood !   I will make the pyre great !   Pile on the wood , kindle the fire . cook the meat , stir the spicy mixture ,   char the bone !   then set it empty on the coal ,   to heat up until its copper glow , so its impurity melt ,   its filth disappear .    the toil be exhausting ,   but the great filth will not come out\xe2\x80\x94 filth , even with fire .   even in defile yourself with depravity   I would still have cleanse you ,   but you would not have your impurity cleanse . you will not be cleanse now   until I wreak my fury on you .    I , the   Lord , have speak ;   it will happen ! I will do it and not hold back !   I will not have pity or relent . by your conduct and deed you shall be judged\xe2\x80\x94   oracle of the Lord   God .    Ezekiel as a Sign for the Exiles .     the word of the   Lord   come to I :      Son of man , with a sudden blow I be take away from you the delight of your eye , but do not mourn or weep or shed any tear .        Groan , moan for the dead , but make no public lament ; bind on your turban , put your sandal on your foot , but do not cover your beard or eat the bread of mourner .        I speak to the people in the morning . in the evening my wife die . the next morning I do as I have be command .        then the people ask I , will you not tell we what all these thing you be do mean for we ?      I say to they , the word of the   Lord   come to I :      say to the house of Israel : thus say the Lord   God : I will now desecrate my sanctuary , the pride of your strength , the delight of your eye , the concern of your soul . the son and daughter you leave behind shall fall by the sword .         then you shall do as I have do , not cover your beard nor eat the bread of mourning .       your turban shall remain on your head , your sandal on your foot . you shall not mourn or weep , but you shall waste away because of your sin and groan to one another .      Ezekiel shall be a sign for you : everything he do , you shall do . when it happen , you shall know that I be the Lord   God .    end of Ezekiels Muteness .      as for you , son of man , truly , on the very day I take away from they their strength , their glorious joy , the delight of their eye , the desire of their soul , the pride of their heart , their son and daughter ,      on that day a survivor will come to you so that you may hear it with your own ear .        on that day , with the survivor , your mouth shall be open ; you shall speak and be mute    no long . you shall be a sign to they , and they shall know that I be the   Lord .
