b '   the Crisis of Mixed Marriages .      when these matter have be conclude , the leader approach I with this report : neither the israelite layman nor the priest nor the Levites have keep themselves separate from the people of the land and their abominations\xe2\x80\x94canaanite , Hittites , Perizzites , Jebusites , Ammonites , Moabites , Egyptians , and amorites\xe2\x80\x94      for they have take some of their daughter as wife for themselves and their son , thus intermingle the holy seed with the people of the land . furthermore , the leader and ruler have take a prominent part in this apostasy !    Ezras Reaction .      when I have hear this , I tear my cloak and my mantle , pluck hair from my head and beard , and sit there devastate .       around I gather all who be in dread of the sentence of the God of Israel    on the apostasy of the exile , while I remain devastate until the evening sacrifice .      then , at the time of the evening sacrifice , I rise in my wretchedness , and with cloak and mantle tear I fall on my knee , stretch out my hand to the   Lord , my God .    a Penitential Prayer .       I say : my God , I be too ashamed and humiliate to raise my face to you , my God , for our wicked deed be heap up above our head and our guilt reach up to heaven .      from the time of our ancestor even to this day our guilt have be great , and for our wicked deed we have be deliver , we and our king and our priest , into the hand of the king of foreign land , to the sword , to captivity , to pillage , and to disgrace , as be the case today .      and now , only a short time ago , mercy come to we from the   Lord , our God , who leave we a remnant and give we a stake in his holy place ; thus our God have brighten our eye and give we relief in our slavery .       for slave we be , but in our slavery our God have not abandon we ; rather , he have turn the good will of the king of Persia toward we . thus he have give we new life to raise again the house of our God and restore its ruin , and have grant we a protective wall in Judah and Jerusalem .      but now , our God , what can we say after all this ? for we have abandon your commandment ,       which you give through your servant the prophet : the land which you be enter to take as your possession be a land unclean with the filth of the people of the land , with the abomination with which they have fill it from one end to the other by their uncleanness .       do not , then , give your daughter to their son in marriage , and do not take their daughter for your son . never promote their welfare and prosperity ; thus you will grow strong , enjoy the produce of the land , and leave it as an inheritance to your child forever .     after all that have come upon we for our evil deed and our great guilt\xe2\x80\x94though you , our God , have make less of our sinfulness than it deserve and have allow we to survive as we do\xe2\x80\x94      shall we again violate your commandment by intermarry with these abominable people ? would you not become so angered with we as to destroy we without remnant or survivor ?      Lord , God of Israel , you be just ; yet we have be spare , the remnant we be today . here we be before you in our sin . because of all this , we can no long stand in your presence .             '
