b ' song for a Royal wedding   for the leader ; accord to lily . a   maskil   of the Korahites . a love song .    I   my heart be stir by a noble theme ,   as I sing my ode to the king .   my tongue be the pen of a nimble scribe .    II   you be the most handsome of man ;   fair speech have grace your lip ,   for God have bless you forever .    Gird your sword upon your hip , mighty warrior !   in splendor and majesty ride on triumphant !    in the cause of truth , meekness , and justice   may your right hand show your wondrous deed .   your arrow be sharp ;   people will cower at your foot ;   the king enemy will lose heart .   your throne , o God ,    stand forever ;    your royal scepter be a scepter for justice .   you love justice and hate wrongdoing ;   therefore God , your God , have anoint you   with the oil of gladness above your fellow king .   with myrrh , aloes , and cassia   your robe be fragrant . from ivory - panel palace    stringed instrument bring you joy .   daughter of king be your lovely wife ;   a princess array in ophir gold    come to stand at your right hand .    III   listen , my daughter , and understand ;   pay I careful heed . forget your people and your father house ,     that the king might desire your beauty . he be your lord ;     honor he , daughter of Tyre . then the rich of the people   will seek your favor with gift .   all glorious be the king daughter as she enter ,    her raiment thread with gold ;   in embroider apparel she be lead to the king .   the maid of her train be present to the king .   they be lead in with glad and joyous acclaim ;   they enter the palace of the king .    IV   the throne of your father your son will have ;   you shall make they prince through all the land .    I will make your name renowne through all generation ;   thus nation shall praise you forever .              '
