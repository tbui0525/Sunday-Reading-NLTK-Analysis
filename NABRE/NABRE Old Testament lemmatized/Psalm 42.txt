b '   longing for Gods Presence in the Temple   for the leader . a   maskil   of the Korahites .     I   as the deer long for stream of water ,    so my soul long for you , o God .   my soul thirst for God , the live God .   when can I enter and see the face of God ?     my tear have be my bread day and night ,    as they ask I every day , where be your God ?    those time I recall   as I pour out my soul ,   when I would cross over to the shrine of the Mighty One ,    to the house of God , amid loud cry of thanksgiving ,   with the multitude keeping festival .    why be you downcast , my soul ;   why do you groan within I ? wait for God , for I shall again praise he ,   my savior and my God .    II   my soul be downcast within I ;   therefore I remember you from the land of the Jordan    and Hermon ,   from Mount Mizar ,     Deep call to deep   in the roar of your torrent ,   and all your wave and breaker   sweep over I .    by day may the   Lord   send his mercy ,   and by night may his righteousness be with I !   I will pray    to the God of my life ,   I will say to God , my rock :   why do you forget I ?   why must I go about mourn   with the enemy oppress I ?   it shatter my bone , when my adversary reproach I ,   when they say to I every day : where be your God ?   why be you downcast , my soul ,   why do you groan within I ? wait for God , for I shall again praise he ,   my savior and my God .
