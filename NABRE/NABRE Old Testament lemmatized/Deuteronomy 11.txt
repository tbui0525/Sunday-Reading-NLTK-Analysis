b '   recall the Wonders of the Lord .     love the   Lord , your God , therefore , and keep his charge , statute , ordinance , and commandment always .        Recall today that it be not your child , who have neither know nor see the discipline of the   Lord , your god\xe2\x80\x94his greatness , his strong hand and outstretched arm ;        the sign and deed he work in the midst of Egypt , on Pharaoh , king of Egypt , and on all his land ;        what he do to the egyptian army and to their horse and chariot , engulf they in the water of the Red Sea    as they pursue you ,    so that the   Lord   destroy they even to this day ;      what he do for you in the wilderness until you come to this place ;      and what he do to the Reubenites Dathan and Abiram , son of Eliab , when the earth open its mouth and swallow they up out of the midst of Israel , with their family and tent and every living thing that belong to them\xe2\x80\x94        but it be you who see with your own eye all these great deed that the   Lord   have do .    the Gift of Rain .      so keep all the commandment I give you today , that you may be strong enough to enter in and take possession of the land that you be cross over to possess ,      and that you may have long life on the land which the   Lord   swear to your ancestor he would give to they and their descendant , a land flow with milk and honey .      the land you be to enter and possess be not like the land of Egypt from which you have come , where you would sow your seed and then water it by hand ,    as in a vegetable garden .       no , the land into which you be cross to take possession be a land of mountain and valley that drink in rain from the heavens ,      a land which the   Lord , your God , look after ; the eye of the   Lord , your God , be upon it continually through the year , from begin to end .       if , then , you truly listen to my commandment which I give you today , love and serve the   Lord , your God , with your whole heart and your whole being ,      I will give the seasonal rain to your land , the early rain    and the late rain , that you may have your grain , wine and oil to gather in ;      and I will bring forth grass in your field for your animal . thus you may eat and be satisfied .       but be careful lest your heart be so lure away that you serve other god and bow down to they .        for then the anger of the   Lord   will flare up against you and he will close up the heaven , so that no rain will fall , and the soil will not yield its crop , and you will soon perish from the good land the   Lord   be give you .    need for Fidelity .      therefore , take these word of mine into your heart and soul . bind they on your arm as a sign , and let they be as a pendant on your forehead .      teach they to your child , speak of they when you be at home and when you be away , when you lie down and when you get up ,      and write they on the doorpost of your house and on your gate ,      so that , as long as the heaven be above the earth , you and your child may live on in the land which the   Lord   swear to your ancestor he would give they .      for if you be careful to observe this entire commandment I be give you , love the   Lord , your God , follow his way exactly , and hold fast to he ,      the   Lord   will dispossess all these nation before you , and you will dispossess nation great and mighty than yourself .       every place where you set foot shall be your : from the wilderness and the Lebanon , from the Euphrates River to the Western Sea ,    shall be your territory .      none shall stand up against you ; the   Lord , your God , will spread the fear and dread of you through any land where you set foot , as he promise you .     Blessing and curse .      see , I set before you this day a blessing and a curse :      a blessing for obey the commandment of the   Lord , your God , which I give you today ;      a curse if you do not obey the commandment of the   Lord , your God , but turn aside from the way I command you today , to go after other god , whom you do not know .        when the   Lord , your God , bring you into the land which you be to enter and possess , then on Mount Gerizim you shall pronounce the blessing ,    on Mount Ebal , the curse .        ( these be beyond the Jordan , on the other side of the western road in the land of the Canaanites who live in the Arabah , opposite Gilgal beside the oak of Moreh . )        now you be about to cross the Jordan to enter and possess the land which the   Lord , your God , be give you . when , therefore , you take possession of it and settle there ,      be careful to observe all the statute and ordinance that I set before you today .
