b '    the word of Davids son , Qoheleth , king in Jerusalem :       Vanity of vanity ,    say Qoheleth ,   vanity of vanity ! all thing be vanity !     Vanity of Human Toil   what profit have we from all the toil   which we toil at under the sun ?     one generation depart and another generation come ,   but the world forever stay .   the sun rise and the sun set ;   then it press on to the place where it rise .   shift south , then north ,   back and forth shift the wind , constantly shift its course .   all river flow to the sea ,   yet never do the sea become full . to the place where they flow ,   the river continue to flow .   all thing be wearisome ,    too wearisome for word . the eye be not satisfied by see   nor have the ear enough of hearing .      what have be , that will be ; what have be do , that will be do . nothing be new under the sun !        even the thing of which we say , see , this be new ! have already exist in the age that precede we .        there be no remembrance of past generation ;    nor will future generation be remember by those who come after they .     I. Qoheleths Investigation of Life Twofold Introduction .     I , Qoheleth , be king over Israel in Jerusalem ,      and I apply my mind to search and investigate in wisdom all thing that be do under the sun .   a bad business God have give   to human being to be busy with .     I have see all thing that be do under the sun , and behold , all be vanity and a chase after wind .       what be crooked can not be make straight ,   and you can not count what be not there .       though I say to myself , see , I have greatly increase my wisdom beyond all who be before I in Jerusalem , and my mind have broad experience of wisdom and knowledge ,      yet when I apply my mind to know wisdom and knowledge , madness and folly , I learn that this also be a chase after wind .      for in much wisdom there be much sorrow ;   whoever increase knowledge increase grief .
