b '    request for a king .      in his old age Samuel appoint his son judge over Israel .        his firstborn be name Joel , his second son , Abijah ; they judge at Beer - sheba .      his son do not follow his example , but look to their own gain , accept bribe and pervert justice .        therefore all the elder of Israel assemble and go to Samuel at Ramah      and say to he , now that you be old , and your son do not follow your example , appoint a king over we , like all the nation , to rule we .      Samuel be displeased when they say , give we a king to rule we . but he pray to the   Lord .      the   Lord   say : listen to whatever the people say . you be not the one they be reject . they be reject I as their king .        they be act toward you just as they have act from the day I bring they up from Egypt to this very day , desert I to serve other god .      now listen to they ; but at the same time , give they a solemn warning and inform they of the right of the king who will rule they .    the Governance of the King .     Samuel deliver the message of the   Lord   in full to those who be ask he for a king .      he tell they : the governance of the king who will rule you will be as follow : he will take your son and assign they to his chariot and horse , and they will run before his chariot .        he will appoint from among they his commander of thousand and of hundred . he will make they do his plowing and harvesting and produce his weapon of war and chariotry .        he will use your daughter as perfumer , cook , and baker .      he will take your good field , vineyard , and olive grove , and give they to his servant .        he will tithe your crop and grape harvest to give to his official    and his servant .        he will take your male and female slave , as well as your good oxen and donkey , and use they to do his work .      he will also tithe your flock . as for you , you will become his slave .        on that day you will cry out because of the king whom you have choose , but the   Lord   will not answer you on that day .    persistent Demand .     the people , however , refuse to listen to Samuels warning and say , no ! there must be a king over we .        we too must be like all the nation , with a king to rule we , lead we in warfare , and fight our battle .      Samuel listen to all the concern of the people and then repeat they to the   Lord .      the   Lord   say : listen to they ! appoint a king to rule over they . then Samuel say to the people of Israel , Return , each one of you , to your own city .
