b '    the people who walk in darkness   have see a great light ; upon those who live in a land of gloom   a light have shine .    you have bring they abundant joy   and great rejoicing ; they rejoice before you as people rejoice at harvest ,   as they exult when divide the spoil .   for the yoke that burden they ,   the pole on their shoulder , the rod of their taskmaster ,   you have smash , as on the day of Midian .     for every boot that tramp in battle ,   every cloak roll in blood ,   will be burn as fuel for fire .    for a child    be bear to we , a son be give to we ;   upon his shoulder dominion rest . they name he Wonder - Counselor , God - Hero ,    Father - Forever , Prince of Peace .   his dominion be vast   and forever peaceful , upon Davids throne , and over his kingdom ,   which he confirm and sustain by judgment and justice ,   both now and forever .   the zeal of the   Lord   of host will do this !    judgment on the Northern Kingdom    the Lord have send a word against Jacob ,   and it fall upon Israel ;   and all the people know it\xe2\x80\x94   Ephraim and those who dwell in Samaria\xe2\x80\x94   those who say in arrogance and pride of heart ,   Bricks have fall ,   but we will rebuild with cut stone ; sycamore have be fell ,   but we will replace they with cedar .    so the   Lord   raise up their foe against they   and stir up their enemy to action\xe2\x80\x94   Aram    from the east and the Philistines from the west\xe2\x80\x94   they devour Israel with open mouth . for all this , his wrath be not turn back ,   and his hand be still outstretche !   the people do not turn back to the one who strike they ,   nor do they seek the   Lord   of host .   so the   Lord   cut off from Israel head and tail ,   palm branch and reed in one day .    ( the elder and the noble be the head ,   the prophet who teach falsehood be the tail . )    those who lead this people lead they astray ,   and those who be lead be swallow up .    that be why the Lord do not spare their young man ,   and their orphan and widow he do not pity ; for they be totally impious and wicked ,   and every mouth speak folly . for all this , his wrath be not turn back ,   his hand be still outstretche !   for wickedness burn like fire ,   devour bri and thorn ; it kindle the forest thicket ,   which go up in column of smoke .    at the wrath of the   Lord   of host the land quake ,   and the people be like fuel for fire ;   no one spare his brother .    they hack on the right , but remain hungry ;   they devour on the left , but be not fill .   each devour the flesh of the neighbor ;   Manasseh devour Ephraim ,    and Ephraim Manasseh ,   together they turn on Judah . for all this , his wrath be not turn back ,   his hand be still outstretche !
