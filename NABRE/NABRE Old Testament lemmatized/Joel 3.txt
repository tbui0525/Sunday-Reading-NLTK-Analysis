b ' III . the Lords Final Judgment   the Day of the Lord     it shall come to pass   I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh . your son and daughter will prophesy ,   your old man will dream dream ,   your young man will see vision .   even upon your male and female servant ,   in those day , I will pour out my spirit .   I will set sign in the heaven and on the earth ,   blood , fire , and column of smoke ;   the sun will darken ,   the moon turn blood - red , before the day of the   Lord   arrive ,   that great and terrible day .    then everyone who call upon the name of the   Lord   will escape harm . for on Mount Zion there will be a remnant ,   as the   Lord   have say , and in Jerusalem survivor   whom the   Lord   will summon .
