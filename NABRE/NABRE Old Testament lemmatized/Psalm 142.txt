b ' A prayer in Time of Trouble   a   maskil   of David , when he be in the cave .    a prayer .     with my own voice I cry to the   Lord ;   with my own voice I beseech the   Lord .   before he I pour out my complaint ,   tell of my distress in front of he .   when my spirit be faint within I ,    you know my path .   as I go along this path ,   they have hide a trap for I .    I look to my right hand to see    that there be no one willing to acknowledge I . my escape have perish ;   no one care for I .   I cry out to you ,   Lord ,   I say , you be my refuge ,    my portion in the land of the living .    listen to my cry for help ,   for I be bring very low .   rescue I from my pursuer ,   for they be too strong for I .   lead my soul from prison ,   that I may give thank to your name . then the righteous shall gather around I    because you have be good to I .
