b '   the Communitys Lament to the Lord   Remember ,   Lord , what have happen to we ,   pay attention , and see our disgrace :   our heritage be turn over to stranger ,   our home , to foreigner .    we have become orphan , without father ;   our mother be like widow .   we pay money to drink our own water ,   our own wood come at a price .   with a yoke on our neck , we be drive ;   we be wear out , but allow no rest .     we extend a hand to Egypt and Assyria ,   to satisfy our need of bread .    our ancestor , who sin , be no more ;   but now we bear their guilt .   servant    rule over we ,   with no one to tear we from their hand .   we risk our life just to get bread ,   expose to the desert heat ;    our skin heat up like an oven ,   from the sear blast of famine .      woman be rape in Zion ,   young woman in the city of Judah ;    prince have be hang by they ,   elder show no respect .    young man carry millstone ,   boy stagger under load of wood ;   the elder have abandon the gate ,    the young man their music .     the joy of our heart have cease ,   dancing have turn into mourning ;    the crown have fall from our head :   woe to we that we sin !   because of this our heart grow sick ,   at this our eye grow dim :   because of Mount Zion , lie desolate ,   and the jackal roam there !     but you ,   Lord , be enthrone forever ;   your throne stand from age to age .     why have you utterly forget we ,   forsake we for so long ?    bring we back to you ,   Lord , that we may return :   renew our day as of old .    for now you have indeed reject we   and utterly turn your wrath against we .
