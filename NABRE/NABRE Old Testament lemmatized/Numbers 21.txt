b '   victory over Arad .     when the Canaanite , the king of Arad ,    who rule over the Negeb ,    hear that the Israelites be come along the way of Atharim , he engage Israel in battle and take some of they captive .      Israel then make this vow to the   Lord : if you deliver this people into my hand , I will put their city under the ban .        the   Lord   pay attention to Israel and deliver up the Canaanites ,    and they put they and their city under the ban . hence that place be name Hormah .     the Bronze Serpent .     from Mount Hor they set out by way of the Red Sea , to bypass the land of Edom , but the people patience be wear out by the journey ;      so the people complain    against God and Moses , why have you bring we up from Egypt to die in the wilderness , where there be no food or water ? we be disgusted with this wretched food !      so the   Lord   send among the people seraph    serpent , which bit    the people so that many of the Israelites die .      then the people come to Moses and say , we have sin in complain against the   Lord   and you . pray to the   Lord   to take the serpent from we . so Moses pray for the people ,      and the   Lord   say to Moses : make a seraph and mount it on a pole , and everyone who have be bite will look at it and recover .        accordingly Moses make a bronze serpent    and mount it on a pole , and whenever the serpent bit someone , the person look at the bronze serpent and recover .     Journey around Moab .     the Israelites move on and encamp in Oboth .        then they move on from Oboth and encamp in Iye - abarim    in the wilderness face Moab on the east .      move on from there , they encamp in the Wadi Zered .      move on from there , they encamp on the other side of the Arnon , in the wilderness that extend from the territory of the Amorites ; for the Arnon form Moabs boundary , between Moab and the Amorites .      hence it be say in the Book of the Wars of the   Lord :   Waheb in Suphah and the wadie ,    Arnon and the wadi gorge that reach back toward the site of Ar    and lean against the border of Moab .     from there they go to Beer ,    which be the well of which the   Lord   say to Moses , gather the people together so that I may give they water .      then Israel sing this song : spring up , o well!\xe2\x80\x94so sing to it\xe2\x80\x94   the well that the prince sink ,   that the noble of the people dig , with their scepter and their staffs\xe2\x80\x94   from the wilderness , a gift .     from Beer to Nahaliel , from Nahaliel to Bamoth ,      from Bamoth to the valley in the country of Moab at the headland of Pisgah that overlook Jeshimon .     victory over Sihon .     now Israel send messenger to Sihon , king of the Amorites , with the message ,      let we pass through your land . we will not turn aside into any field or vineyard , nor will we drink any well water , but we will go straight along the Kings Highway until we have pass through your territory .      Sihon ,    however , would not permit Israel to pass through his territory , but muster all his force and advance against Israel into the wilderness . when he reach Jahaz , he engage Israel in battle .      but Israel put he to the sword , and take possession of his land from the Arnon to the Jabbok and as far as Jazer of the Ammonites , for Jazer be the boundary of the Ammonites .       Israel seize all the town here , and Israel settle in all the town of the Amorites , in Heshbon and all its dependency .      for Heshbon be the city of Sihon , king of the Amorites , who have fight against the former king of Moab and have take all his land from he as far as the Arnon .      that be why the poet say : come to heshbon , let it be rebuild ,   let Sihons city be firmly construct .   for fire go forth from Heshbon   and a blaze from the city of Sihon ; it consume Ar of Moab   and swallow up the high place of the Arnon .   Woe to you , Moab !   you be no more , people of Chemosh !   he let his son become fugitive   and his daughter be take captive by the Amorite king Sihon .   from Heshbon to Dibon their dominion be no more ;   Ar be lay waste ; fire blaze as far as Medeba .     so Israel settle in the land of the Amorites .      Moses send spy to Jazer ; and the Israelites capture it with its dependency and dispossess the Amorites who be there .    victory over Og .      then they turn and go up along the road to Bashan . but Og , king of Bashan , advanced against they with all his force to give battle at Edrei .      the   Lord , however , say to Moses : do not fear he ; for into your hand I deliver he with all his force and his land . you will do to he as you do to Sihon , king of the Amorites , who reign in Heshbon .        so they strike he down with his son and all his force , until not a survivor be leave to he , and they take possession of his land .
