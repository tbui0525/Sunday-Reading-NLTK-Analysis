b '   Achior in the Assyrian War Council .      it be report to Holofernes , the rank general of the assyrian force , that the Israelites be ready for battle , have block the mountain pass , fortify the high hilltop , and place roadblock in the plain .      in great anger he summon all the ruler of Moab , the governor of Ammon , and all the satrap of the coastland        and say to they : now tell I , you Canaanites , what sort of people be this that live in the hill country ? which city do they inhabit ? how large be their force ? in what do their power and strength consist ? who have set himself up as their king and the leader of their army ?      why have they alone of all the inhabitant of the west refuse to come out to meet I ?      then Achior , the leader of all the Ammonites , say to he : my lord , please listen to a report from your servant . I will tell you the truth about this people that live in the hill country near here . no lie shall escape your servant lip .     these people be descendant of the Chaldeans .      they formerly live in Mesopotamia , for they do not wish to follow the god of their ancestor who be in the land of the Chaldeans .        since they abandon the way of their ancestor , and worship the God of heaven ,    the God whom they have come to know , their ancestor expel they from the presence of their god . so they flee to Mesopotamia and live there a long time .      their God tell they to leave the place where they be live and go to the land of Canaan . here they settle , and grow very rich in gold , silver , and a great abundance of livestock .        later , when famine have grip the land of Canaan , they go down into Egypt . they stay there as long as they find sustenance and there they grow into such a great multitude that the number of their people could not be count .         the king of Egypt , however , rise up against they , and shrewdly force they to labor at brickmaking ; they be oppress and make into slave .      but they cry to their God , and he strike the whole land of Egypt with plague for which there be no remedy . so the Egyptians drive they out .      then God dry up the Red Sea before they        and lead they along the route to Sinai and Kadesh - barnea . they drive out all the inhabitant of the wilderness      and settle in the land of the Amorites . by their strength they destroy all the Heshbonites ,    cross the Jordan , and take possession of all the hill country .        they drive out before they the Canaanites , the Perizzites , the Jebusites , the Shechemites ,    and all the Gergesites ,    and they live there a long time .      as long as the Israelites do not sin in the sight of their God , they prosper , for their God , who hate wickedness , be with they .       but when they abandon the way he have prescribe for they , they be utterly destroy by frequent war , and finally take as captive into foreign land . the temple of their God be raze to the ground , and their city be occupy by their enemy .        but now they have return to their God , and they have come back from the Diaspora where they be scatter . they have reclaim Jerusalem , where their sanctuary be , and have settle again in the hill country , because it be unoccupied .      so now , my master    and lord , if these people be inadvertently at fault , or if they be sin against their God , and if we verify this offense of theirs , then we will be able to go up and conquer they .      but if they be not a guilty nation , then let my lord keep his distance ; otherwise their Lord and God will shield they , and we will be mock in the eye of all the earth .     now when Achior have finish say these thing , all the people stand round about the tent murmur ; and the officer of Holofernes and all the inhabitant of the seacoast and of Moab alike say he should be cut to piece .       we be not afraid of the Israelites , they say , for they be a powerless people , incapable of a strong defense .      therefore let we attack , master Holofernes . they will become fodder for your great army .
