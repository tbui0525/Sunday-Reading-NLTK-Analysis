b '    a king heart be channel water in the hand of the   Lord ;   God direct it where he please .    all your way may be straight in your own eye ,   but it be the   Lord   who weigh heart .    to do what be right and just    be more acceptable to the   Lord   than sacrifice .    haughty eye and a proud heart\xe2\x80\x94   the lamp of the wicked will fail .    the plan of the diligent end in profit ,   but those of the hasty end in loss .    try to get rich by lie   be chase a bubble over deadly snare .   the violence of the wicked will sweep they away ,   because they refuse to do what be right .   Ones path may be wind and unfamiliar ,   but one conduct be blameless and right .    it be well to dwell in a corner of the housetop   than in a mansion with a quarrelsome woman .     the soul of the wicked desire evil ;   their neighbor find no pity in their eye .   when scoffer be punish the naive become wise ;   when the wise succeed , they gain knowledge .    the Righteous One appraise the house of the wicked ,   bring down the wicked to ruin .    those who shut their ear to the cry of the poor   will themselves call out and not be answer .   a secret gift allay anger ,   and a present conceal , violent wrath .    when justice be do it be a joy for the just ,   downfall for evildoer .     whoever stray from the way of good sense   will abide in the assembly of the shade .    the lover of pleasure will suffer want ;   the lover of wine and perfume will never be rich .   the wicked serve as ransom for the just ,   and the faithless for the upright .     it be well to dwell in a wilderness   than with a quarrelsome wife and trouble .   precious treasure and oil be in the house of the wise ,   but the fool consume they .   whoever pursue justice and kindness   will find life and honor .    the wise person storm the city of the mighty ,   and overthrow the stronghold in which they trust .   those who guard mouth and tongue   guard themselves    from trouble .    proud , boastful\xe2\x80\x94scoffer be the name :   those who act with overbearing pride .   the desire of sluggard will slay they ,   for their hand refuse to work .    some be consume with avarice all the day ,   but the just give unsparingly .   the sacrifice of the wicked be an abomination ,   the more so when they offer it with bad intent .    the false witness will perish ,    but one who listen will give lasting testimony .   the face of the wicked harden ,   but the upright maintain a straight course .    no wisdom , no understanding ,   no counsel prevail against the   Lord .   the horse be equip for the day of battle ,   but victory be the   Lord s.
