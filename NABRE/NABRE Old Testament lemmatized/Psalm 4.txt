b ' trust in God   for the leader ;    with stringed instrument . a psalm of David .    I   answer I when I call , my save God .   when trouble hem I in , set I free ;   take pity on I , hear my prayer .     II   how long , o people , will you be hard of heart ?   why do you love what be worthless , chase after lie ?    Selah   know that the   Lord   work wonder for his faithful one ;   the   Lord   hear when I call out to he .   tremble    and sin no more ;   weep bitterly within your heart ,   wail upon your bed ,    offer fit sacrifice   and trust in the   Lord .     III   many say , may we see well time !   Lord , show we the light of your face !   Selah   but you have give my heart more joy   than they have when grain and wine abound .     in peace I will lie down and fall asleep ,   for you alone ,   Lord , make I secure .             '
