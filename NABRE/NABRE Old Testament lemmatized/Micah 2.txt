b '     ah ! you plotter of iniquity ,   who work out evil on your bed ! in the morning light you carry it out   for it lie within your power .    you covet field , and seize they ;   house , and take they ; you cheat owner of their house ,   people of their inheritance .      therefore thus say the   Lord : look , I be plan against this family an evil   from which you can not free your neck ; nor shall you walk with head hold high ,   for it will be an evil time .   on that day you shall be mock ,   and there will be bitter lament : our ruin be complete ,   our field be divide among our captor , the field of my people be measure out ,   and no one can get they back !    thus you shall have no one   in the assembly of the   Lord   to allot to you a share of land .      do not preach , they preach ,   no one should preach of these thing !   Shame will not overtake we .   how can it be say , house of Jacob ,   be the   Lord   short of patience ;   be these the Lords deed ? do not my word promise good   to the one who walk in justice ?   but you rise up against my people as an enemy :   you have strip off the garment from the peaceful , from those who go their way in confidence ,   as though it be spoil of war .   the woman of my people you drive out   from their pleasant house ; from their child you take away   forever the honor I give they .      get up ! leave ,   this be no place to rest ; because of uncleanness that destroy   with terrible destruction .   if one possess of a lie spirit    speak deceitfully , say , I will preach to you wine and strong drink ,   that one would be the preacher for this people .      I will gather you , Jacob , each and every one ,   I will assemble all the remnant of Israel ; I will group they like a flock in the fold ,   like a herd in its pasture ;   the noise of the people will resound .     the one who make a breach go up before they ;   they make a breach and pass through the gate ; their king shall go through before they ,   the   Lord   at their head .
