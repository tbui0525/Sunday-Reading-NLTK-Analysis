b '      the word of Agur , son of Jakeh the Massaite : the pronouncement of mortal man : I be weary , o God ;   I be weary , o God , and I be exhausted .   I be more brute than human being ,   without even human intelligence ;    neither have I learn wisdom ,   nor have I the knowledge of the Holy One .   who have go up to heaven and come down again\xe2\x80\x94   who have cup the wind in the hollow of the hand ? who have bind up the water in a cloak\xe2\x80\x94   who have establish all the end of the earth ? what be that person name , or the name of his son ?       every word of God be test ;    he be a shield to those who take refuge in he .   add nothing to his word ,    lest he reprimand you , and you be prove a liar .      two thing I ask of you ,   do not deny they to I before I die :   put falsehood and lie far from I ,   give I neither poverty nor rich ;   provide I only with the food I need ;   Lest , be full , I deny you ,   say , who be the   Lord ? or , be in want , I steal ,   and profane the name of my God .   do not criticize servant to their master ,   lest they curse you , and you have to pay the penalty .    there be some who curse their father ,   and do not bless their mother .    there be some pure in their own eye ,   yet not cleanse of their filth .   there be some\xe2\x80\x94how haughty their eye !   how overbear their glance !   there be some\xe2\x80\x94their tooth be sword ,   their tooth be knife , devour the needy from the earth ,   and the poor from the human race .    the leech have two daughter :   give , and give . three thing never get their fill ,   four never say , enough !   Sheol , a barren womb ,    land that never get its fill of water ,   and fire , which never say , enough !   the eye that mock a father ,   or scorn the homage due a mother , will be pluck out by brook raven ;   devour by a brood of vulture .    three thing be too wonderful for I ,   yes , four I can not understand :   the way of an eagle in the sky ,   the way of a serpent upon a rock , the way of a ship on the high sea ,   and the way of a man with a woman .   this be the way of an adulterous woman :   she eat , wipe her mouth ,   and say , I have do no wrong .     under three thing the earth tremble ,   yes , under four it can not bear up :   under a slave who become king ,   and a fool who be glut with food ;    under an unloved woman who be we d ,   and a maidservant who displace her mistress .    four thing be among the small on the earth ,   and yet be exceedingly wise :   Ants\xe2\x80\x94a specie not strong ,   yet they store up their food in the summer ;   badgers\xe2\x80\x94a specie not mighty ,   yet they make their home in the crag ;   Locusts\xe2\x80\x94they have no king ,   yet they march forth in formation ;   lizards\xe2\x80\x94you can catch they with your hand ,   yet they find their way into king palace .    three thing be stately in their stride ,   yes , four be stately in their carriage :   the lion , mighty of beast ,   retreat before nothing ;   the strut cock , and the he - goat ,   and the king at the head of his people .    if you have foolishly be proud   or presumptuous\xe2\x80\x94put your hand on your mouth ;   for as the churning of milk produce curd ,   and the pressing of the nose produce blood ,   the churning of anger produce strife .
