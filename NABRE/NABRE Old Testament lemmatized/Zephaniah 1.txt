b '    the word of the   Lord   which come to Zephaniah , the son of Cushi , the son of Gedaliah , the son of Amariah , the son of Hezekiah ,    in the day of Josiah , the son of Amon , king of Judah .    the Day of the Lord : judgment on Judah   I will completely sweep away all thing   from the face of the land\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord .   I will sweep away human being and beast alike ,   I will sweep away the bird of the sky ,   and the fish of the sea . I will make the wicked stumble ;   I will eliminate the people   from the face of the land\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord .    I will stretch out my hand against Judah ,   and against all the inhabitant of Jerusalem ; I will eliminate from this place   the last vestige of Baal ,   the name of the idolatrous priest .   and those who bow down on the roof   to the host of heaven ,   and those who bow down to the   Lord   but swear by Milcom ;    and those who have turn away from the   Lord ,   and those who have not seek the   Lord ,   who have not inquire of he .     silence in the presence of the Lord   God !   for near be the day of the   Lord , yes , the   Lord   have prepare a sacrifice ,   he have consecrate his guest .      on the day of the   Lord s sacrifice I will punish the official and the king son ,   and all who dress in foreign apparel .   I will punish , on that day ,   all who leap over the threshold ,   who fill the house of their master   with violence and deceit .    on that day\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord \xe2\x80\x94 a cry will be hear from the Fish Gate ,   a wail from the Second Quarter ,    loud crash from the hill .   Wail , o inhabitant of Maktesh !   for all the merchant be destroy ,   all who weigh out silver , do away with .      at that time , I will search Jerusalem with lamp ,   I will punish the people   who settle like dreg in wine ,   who say in their heart ,   the Lord will not do good ,   nor will he do harm .   their wealth shall be give to plunder   and their house to devastation ; they will build house ,   but not dwell in they ; they will plant vineyard ,   but not drink their wine .    Near be the great day of the   Lord ,   near and very swiftly come . the sound of the day of the   Lord ! Piercing\xe2\x80\x94   there a warrior shriek !   a day of wrath be that day ,   a day of distress and anguish ,   a day of ruin and desolation , a day of darkness and gloom ,   a day of thick black cloud ,    a day of trumpet blast and battle cry   against fortified city ,   against lofty battlement .    I will hem the people in   till they walk like the blind ,   because they have sin against the   Lord ; and their blood shall be pour out like dust ,   and their bowel like dung .   neither their silver nor their gold   will be able to save they . on the day of the   Lord s wrath ,   in the fire of his passion ,   all the earth will be consume . for he will make an end , yes , a sudden end ,   of all who live on the earth .
