b '   from day of Celebration to day of punishment   do not rejoice , Israel ,   do not exult like the nation ! for you have prostitute yourself , abandon your God ,   love a prostitute fee   upon every threshing floor .    threshing floor and wine press will not nourish they ,   the new wine will fail they .     they will not dwell in the   Lord s land ;   Ephraim will return to Egypt ,   and in Assyria they will eat unclean food .   they will not pour libation of wine to the   Lord ,   and their sacrifice will not please he . their bread will be like mourner bread ,     that make unclean all who eat of it ; their food will be for their own appetite ;   it can not enter the house of the   Lord .     what will you do on the festival day ,   the day of the   Lord s feast ?     when they flee from the devastation ,   Egypt will gather they , Memphis will bury they . weed will overgrow their silver treasure ,   and thorn , their tent .     they have come , the day of punishment !   they have come , the day of recompense ! let Israel know it !   the prophet be a fool ,    the man of the spirit be mad ! because your iniquity be great ,   great , too , be your hostility .    the watchman of Ephraim , the people of my God , be the prophet ;    yet a fowler snare be on all his way ,   hostility in the house of his God .   they have sink to the depth of corruption ,   as in the day of Gibeah ;    God will remember their iniquity   and punish their sin .    from former glory to a history of corruption   like grape in the desert ,   I find Israel ; like the first fruit of the fig tree , its first to ripen ,    I look on your ancestor . but when they come to Baal - peor     and consecrate themselves to the Shameful one ,   they become as abhorrent as the thing they love .   Ephraim be like a bird :   their glory fly away\xe2\x80\x94   no birth , no pregnancy , no conception .    even though they bring up their child ,   I will make they childless , until no one be leave . indeed , woe to they   when I turn away from they !   Ephraim , as I see , be a tree   plant in a meadow ; but now Ephraim will bring out   his child to the slaughterer !   give they ,   Lord !   give they what ? give they a miscarry womb ,   and dry breast !    all their misfortune begin in Gilgal ;    yes , there I reject they . because of their wicked deed   I will drive they out of my house . I will love they no long ;   all their prince be rebel .    Ephraim be stricken ,   their root be dry up ;    they will bear no fruit .   be they to bear child ,   I would slay the beloved of their womb .   my God will disown they   because they have not listen to he ;   they will be wanderer among the nation .
