b '   the Wilderness of Sin .     having set out from Elim , the whole israelite community come into the wilderness of Sin , which be between Elim and Sinai , on the fifteenth day of the second month    after their departure from the land of Egypt .      here in the wilderness the whole israelite community grumble against Moses and Aaron .      the Israelites say to they , if only we have die at the   Lord s hand in the land of Egypt , as we sit by our kettle of meat and eat our fill of bread ! but you have lead we into this wilderness to make this whole assembly die of famine !    the Quail and the Manna .     then the   Lord   say to Moses :    I be go to rain down bread from heaven    for you . each day the people be to go out and gather their daily portion ; thus will I test they , to see whether they follow my instruction or not .      on the sixth day , however , when they prepare what they bring in , let it be twice as much as they gather on the other day .      so Moses and Aaron tell all the Israelites ,    at evening you will know that it be the   Lord   who bring you out of the land of Egypt ;      and in the morning you will see the glory of the   Lord , when he hear your grumble against he . but who be we that you should grumble against we ?      and Moses say , when the   Lord   give you meat to eat in the evening and in the morning your fill of bread , and hear the grumble you utter against he , who then be we ? your grumbling be not against we , but against the   Lord .     then Moses say to Aaron , tell the whole israelite community : approach the   Lord , for he have hear your grumbling .      but while Aaron be speak to the whole israelite community , they turn in the direction of the wilderness , and there the glory of the   Lord   appear in the cloud !      the   Lord   say to Moses :      I have hear the grumbling of the Israelites . tell they : in the evening twilight you will eat meat , and in the morning you will have your fill of bread , and then you will know that I , the   Lord , be your God .     in the evening , quail    come up and cover the camp . in the morning there be a layer of dew all about the camp ,      and when the layer of dew evaporate , fine flake be on the surface of the wilderness , fine flake like hoarfrost on the ground .      on see it , the Israelites ask one another , what be this ?    for they do not know what it be . but Moses tell they , it be the bread which the   Lord   have give you to eat .     regulation regard the Manna .     now , this be what the   Lord   have command . gather as much of it as each need to eat , an omer    for each person for as many of you as there be , each of you provide for those in your own tent .      the Israelites do so . some gather a large and some a small amount .       but when they measure it out by the omer , the one who have gather a large amount do not have too much , and the one who have gather a small amount do not have too little . they gather as much as each need to eat .      Moses say to they , let no one leave any of it over until morning .      but they do not listen to Moses , and some keep a part of it over until morning , and it become wormy and stank . therefore Moses be angry with they .     morning after morning they gather it , as much as each need to eat ; but when the sun grow hot , it melt away .      on the sixth day they gather twice as much food , two omer for each person . when all the leader of the community come and report this to Moses ,      he tell they , that be what the   Lord   have prescribe . tomorrow be a day of rest , a holy sabbath of the   Lord . whatever you want to bake , bake ; whatever you want to boil , boil ; but whatever be leave put away and keep until the morning .      when they put it away until the morning , as Moses command , it do not stink nor be there worm in it .      Moses then say , eat it today , for today be the sabbath of the   Lord . today you will not find any in the field .      six day you will gather it , but on the seventh day , the sabbath , it will not be there .      still , on the seventh day some of the people go out to gather it , but they do not find any .      then the   Lord   say to Moses : how long will you refuse to keep my commandment and my instruction ?      take note ! the   Lord   have give you the sabbath . that be why on the sixth day he give you food for two day . each of you stay where you be and let no one go out on the seventh day .      after that the people rest on the seventh day .     the house of Israel name this food manna .    it be like coriander seed ,    white , and it taste like wafer make with honey .     Moses say , this be what the   Lord   have command . keep a full omer of it for your future generation , so that they may see the food I give you to eat in the wilderness when I bring you out of the land of Egypt .      Moses then tell Aaron , take a jar    and put a full omer of manna in it . then place it before the   Lord   to keep it for your future generation .      as the   Lord   have command Moses , Aaron place it in front of the covenant    to keep it .     the Israelites eat the manna for forty year , until they come to settle land ;    they eat the manna until they come to the border of Canaan .      ( an omer be one tenth of an ephah . )              '
