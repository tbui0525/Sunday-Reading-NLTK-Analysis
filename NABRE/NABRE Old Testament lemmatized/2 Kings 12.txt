Joash do what be right in the   Lord s sight as long as he live , because Jehoiada the priest guide he ,      though the high place do not disappear ; the people continue to sacrifice and to burn incense on the high place .     Joash say to the priest : all the fund for sacred purpose that be bring to the house of the   Lord \xe2\x80\x94the census tax , personal redemption money\xe2\x80\x94and all fund that be freely bring to the house of the   Lord ,      the priest may take for themselves , each from his own vendor . however , they must make whatever repair on the temple may prove necessary .      nevertheless , as late as the twenty - third year of the reign of King Joash , the priest have not make need repair on the temple .      accordingly , King Joash summon the priest Jehoiada and the other priest . he ask , why do you not repair the temple ? you must no long take fund from your vendor , but you shall turn they over for the repair .      so the priest agree that they would neither take fund from the people nor make the repair on the temple .     Jehoiada the priest then take a chest , bore a hole in its lid , and set it beside the altar , on the right as one enter the house of the   Lord . the priest who keep the door would put into it all the silver that be bring to the house of the   Lord .       when they notice that there be a large amount of silver in the chest , the royal scribe would come up with the high priest , and they would gather up and weigh all the silver that be in the house of the   Lord .      the amount thus realize they turn over to the worker assign to the house of the   Lord . they in turn would pay it to the carpenter and builder work in the house of the   Lord ,      and to the mason and stone cutter , and for the purchase of the wood and hewn stone use in repair the breach , and for any other expense that be necessary to repair the house of the   Lord .      none of the valuable bring to the house of the   Lord   be use there to make silver basin , snuffer , bowl , trumpet , or any gold or silver article .      instead , they be give to the worker , and with they they repair the house of the   Lord .      moreover , no reckoning be ask of those who be provide with the fund to give to the worker , because they hold position of trust .      the fund from reparation offering and from purification offering , however , be not bring to the house of the   Lord ; they belong to the priest .     then Hazael , king of Aram , come up and attack Gath . when he have take it , Hazael resolve to go on to attack Jerusalem .      Joash ,    king of Judah , take all the sacred offering present by his forebear , Jehoshaphat , Jehoram , and Ahaziah , king of Judah , as well as his own , and all the gold there be in the treasury of the house of the   Lord   and the king house , and send they to King Hazael of Aram , who then turn away from Jerusalem .     the rest of the act of Joash , with all that he do , be record in the book of the chronicle of the king of Judah .      certain of his official    enter into a conspiracy and strike Joash down at Beth - millo .
