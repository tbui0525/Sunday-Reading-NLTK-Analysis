b '   the Hidden Counsels of God    the soul of the righteous be in the hand of God ,    and no torment shall touch they .   they seem , in the view of the foolish , to be dead ;   and their pass away be think an affliction    and their go forth from we , utter destruction . but they be in peace .    for if to other , indeed , they seem punish ,   yet be their hope full of immortality ;   chastise a little , they shall be greatly bless ,   because God try they   and find they worthy of himself .    as gold in the furnace , he prove they ,   and as sacrificial offering    he take they to himself .    in the time of their judgment    they shall shine   and dart about as spark through stubble ;    they shall judge nation and rule over people ,   and the   Lord   shall be their king forever .    those who trust in he shall understand truth ,   and the faithful shall abide with he in love : because grace and mercy be with his holy one ,    and his care be with the elect .   but the wicked shall receive a punishment to match their thought ,    since they neglect righteousness and forsook the   Lord .   for those who despise wisdom and instruction be doom .   Vain be their hope , fruitless their labor ,   and worthless their work .    their wife be foolish and their child wicke ,   accurse their brood .     B. on Childlessness    yes , bless be she who , childless and undefiled ,   never know transgression of the marriage bed ;   for she shall bear fruit at the judgment of soul .    so also the eunuch whose hand work no misdeed ,   who hold no wicked thought against the   Lord \xe2\x80\x94 for he shall be give fidelitys choice reward    and a more gratifying heritage in the   Lord s temple .    for the fruit of noble struggle be a glorious one ;   and unfailing be the root of understanding .     but the child of adulterer    will remain without issue ,   and the progeny of an unlawful bed will disappear .    for should they attain long life , they will be hold in no esteem ,   and dishonored will their old age be in the end ;   should they die abruptly , they will have no hope   nor comfort in the day of scrutiny ;    for dire be the end of the wicked generation .
