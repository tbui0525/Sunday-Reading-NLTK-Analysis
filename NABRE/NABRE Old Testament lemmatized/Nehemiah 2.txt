I pray to the God of heaven      and then answer the king : if it please the king , and if your servant be deserve of your favor , send I to Judah , to the city where my ancestor be bury , that I may rebuild it .      then the king , with the queen seat beside he , ask I , how long will your journey take and when will you return ? my answer be acceptable to the king and he agree to let I go ; I set a date for my return .
