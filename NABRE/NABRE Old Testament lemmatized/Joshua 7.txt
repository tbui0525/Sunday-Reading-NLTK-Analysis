b '   Defeat at Ai .     but the Israelites act treacherously with regard to the ban ; Achan , son of Carmi , son of Zabdi , son of Zerah of the tribe of Judah , take good that be under the ban ,    and the anger of the   Lord   flare up against the Israelites .      Joshua next send man from Jericho to Ai , which be near Beth - aven and east of Bethel , with the order , go up and reconnoiter the land . when they have explore Ai ,      they return to Joshua and advise , do not send all the people up ; if only about two or three thousand go up , they can attack and overcome Ai . you need not tire all the people : the enemy there be few .      about three thousand of the people make the attack , but they flee before the army at Ai ,      who kill some thirty - six of they . they pursue they from the city gate to the Shebarim , and defeat they on the descent , so that the confidence of the people melt away like water .     Joshua , together with the elder of Israel , tear their garment and fall face down before the ark of the   Lord   until evening ; and they throw dust on their head .      alas , Lord   God , Joshua pray , why do you ever allow this people to cross over the Jordan , deliver we into the power of the Amorites , that they might destroy we ? would that we have be content to dwell on the other side of the Jordan .      please , Lord , what can I say , now that Israel have turn its back to its enemy ?      when the Canaanites and the other inhabitant of the land hear of it , they will close in around we and efface our name from the earth . what will you do for your great name ?      the   Lord   reply to Joshua : stand up . why be you lie there ?       Israel have sin : they have transgress the covenant    which I enjoin on they . they have take good subject to the ban . they have steal and lie , place the good in their baggage .      if the Israelites can not stand up to their enemy , but must turn their back to they , it be because they be under the ban . I will not continue to be with you unless you remove that which be ban from among you .      get up , sanctify the people .    tell they , sanctify yourselves before tomorrow , for thus say the   Lord , the God of Israel : that which be ban be in your midst , Israel . you can not stand up to your enemy until you remove it from among you .      in the morning you must come forward by tribe . the tribe which the   Lord   designate shall come forward by clan ; the clan which the   Lord   designate shall come forward by family ; the family which the   Lord   designate shall come forward one by one .      whoever be designate as having incur the ban shall be destroy by fire , with all that be his , because he have trangresse the covenant of the   Lord   and have commit a shameful crime in Israel .     achan guilt and punishment .     early the next morning Joshua have Israel come forward by tribe , and the tribe of Judah be designate .        then he have the clan of Judah come forward , and the clan of Zerah be designate . he have the clan of Zerah    come forward by family , and Zabdi be designate .      finally he have that family come forward one by one , and Achan , son of Carmi , son of Zabdi , son of Zerah of the tribe of Judah , be designate .      Joshua say to Achan , my son , give glory to the   Lord , the God of Israel , and praise he by tell I what you have do ; do not hide it from I .      Achan answer Joshua , I have indeed sin against the   Lord , the God of Israel . this be what I have do :      among the spoil , I see a beautiful babylonian mantle , two hundred shekel of silver , and a bar of gold fifty shekel in weight ; I covet they and I take they . they be now hide in the ground inside my tent , with the silver underneath .      Joshua send messenger and they run to the tent and there they be , hide in the tent , with the silver underneath .      they take they from the tent , bring they to Joshua and all the Israelites , and spread they out before the   Lord .     then Joshua and all Israel take Achan , son of Zerah , with the silver , the mantle , and the bar of gold , and with his son and daughter , his ox , his donkey and his sheep , his tent , and all his possession , and lead they off to the Valley of Achor .      Joshua say , what misery have you cause we ? may the   Lord   bring misery upon you today !    and all Israel stone he to death . they burn they with fire and they stone they .      over Achan they pile a great heap of stone , which remain to the present day .    then the   Lord   turn from his anger . that be why the place be call the Valley of Achor    to this day .
