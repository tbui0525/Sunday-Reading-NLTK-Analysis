b '   Alliance with Israel .      Jehoshaphat therefore have wealth and glory in abundance ; but he become related to Ahab by marriage .      after some year he go down to Ahab at Samaria ; Ahab slaughter numerous sheep and oxen for he and for the people with he , and incite he to go up against Ramoth - gilead .      Ahab , king of Israel , ask Jehoshaphat , king of Judah , will you come with I to Ramoth - gilead ? he answer , you and I be as one , and your people and my people as well . we will be with you in the battle .      Jehoshaphat also say to the king of Israel , seek the word of the   Lord   at once .    prophet in conflict .     the king of Israel assemble the prophet , four hundred of they , and ask , shall we go to fight against Ramoth - gilead , or shall I refrain ? they say , Attack . God will give it into the power of the king .      but Jehoshaphat say , be there no other prophet of the   Lord   here we might consult ?      the king of Israel answer , there be one other man through whom we may consult the   Lord ; but I hate he , because he prophesy not good but always evil about I . he be Micaiah , son of Imlah . Jeshoshaphat say , let not the king say that .      so the king of Israel call an official , and say to he , get Micaiah , son of Imlah , at once .      the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat , king of Judah , be seat , each on his throne , clothe in their robe of state in the square at the entrance of the gate of Samaria , and all the prophet be prophesy before they .     Zedekiah , son of Chenaanah , make himself two horn of iron and say : the   Lord   say : with these you shall gore Aram until you have destroy they .      the other prophet prophesy in the same vein , say : Attack Ramoth - gilead , and conquer ! the   Lord   will give it into the power of the king .       meanwhile the messenger who have go to call Micaiah say to he : look now , the word of the prophet be as one in speak good for the king . let your word be at one with theirs ; speak a good word .      Micaiah say , as the   Lord   live , I shall speak whatever my God say .     when he come to the king , the king say to he , Micah , shall we go to fight at Ramoth - gilead , or shall I refrain ? he say , attack and conquer ! they will be deliver into your power .      but the king answer he , how many time must I adjure you to tell I nothing but the truth in the name of the   Lord ?      so Micaiah say : I see all Israel   scatter on the mountain ,   like sheep without a shepherd , and the   Lord   say ,   these have no master !   let each of they go back home in peace .     the king of Israel say to Jehoshaphat , do I not tell you , he do not prophesy good about I , but only evil ?      Micaiah continue : therefore hear the word of the   Lord . I see the   Lord   seat on his throne , with the whole host of heaven stand to his right and to his left .      the   Lord   ask : who will deceive Ahab , king of Israel , so that he will go up and fall on Ramoth - gilead ? and one say this , another that ,      until this spirit come forth and stand before the   Lord , say , I will deceive he . the   Lord   ask : how ?      he answer , I will go forth and become a lie spirit in the mouth of all his prophet . the   Lord   reply : you shall succeed in deceive he . go forth and do this .      so now the   Lord   have put a lie spirit in the mouth of these prophet of your ; but the   Lord   himself have decree evil against you .     Thereupon Zedekiah , son of Chenaanah , come up and strike Micaiah on the cheek , say , have the spirit of the   Lord , then , pass from I to speak with you ?      Micaiah say , you shall find out on the day you go into an innermost room to hide .      the king of Israel then say : seize Micaiah and take he back to Amon , prefect of the city , and to Joash the king son ,      and say , this be the king order : put this man in prison and feed he scanty ration of bread and water until I come back in safety !      but Micaiah say , if ever you return in safety , the   Lord   have not speak through I . ( he also say , Hear , o people , all of you ! )     Ahabs Death .     the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat , king of Judah , go up to Ramoth - gilead ,      and the king of Israel say to Jehoshaphat , I will disguise myself and go into battle . but you , put on your own robe . so the king of Israel disguise himself and they enter the battle .      in the meantime , the king of Aram have give his chariot commander the order , fight with no one , great or small , except the king of Israel alone .      when the chariot commander see Jehoshaphat , they think , there be the king of Israel ! and wheel to fight he . but Jehoshaphat cry out and the   Lord   help he ; God induce they to leave he alone .      the chariot commander , see that he be not the king of Israel , turn away from he .      but someone draw his bow at random and hit the king of Israel between the joint of his breastplate . he order his charioteer , Rein about and take I out of the rank , for I be wound .        the battle grow fierce during the day , and the king of Israel brace himself up in his chariot face the Arameans until evening . he die as the sun be set .
