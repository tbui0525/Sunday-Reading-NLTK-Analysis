b '      at that time , when the book of Moses be be read in the hearing of the people , it be find write there : no Ammonite or Moabite may ever be admit into the assembly of God ;       for they do not meet the Israelites with food and water , but they hire Balaam to curse they , though our God turn the curse into a blessing .       when they have hear the law , they separate all those of mixed descent from Israel .    reform in the Temple .      before this , the priest Eliashib , who have be place in charge of the chamber of the house of our God and who be an associate of Tobiah ,       have set aside for the latter use a large chamber in which have previously be store the grain offering , incense and vessel , the tithe in grain , wine , and oil allot to the Levites , singer , and gatekeeper , and the offering due the priest .      during all this time I have not be in Jerusalem , for in the thirty - second year of Artaxerxes ,    king of Babylon , I have go back to the king . after a suitable period of time , however , I ask leave of the king      and return to Jerusalem , where I discover the evil thing that Eliashib have do for Tobiah , in set aside for he a chamber in the court of the house of God .      this displease I very much , so I have all of Tobiahs household good throw outside the chamber .      then I give order to purify the chamber , and I bring back the vessel of the house of God , the grain offering , and the incense .     I learn , too , that the portion due the Levites be no long be give , so that the Levites and the singer who should have be carry out the service have desert to their own field .      I reprimand the magistrate , demand , why be the house of God neglect ? then I bring the Levites together and have they resume their station .       all Judah once more bring in the tithe of grain , wine , and oil to the storeroom .      in charge of the storeroom I appoint Shelemiah the priest , Zadok the scribe , and Pedaiah , one of the Levites , together with Hanan , son of Zaccur , son of Mattaniah , as their assistant ; for they be consider trustworthy . it be their duty to make the distribution to their kinsman .      remember this to my credit , my God ! do not forget the good deed I have do for the house of my God and its service !    Sabbath Observance .      in those day I perceive that people in Judah be tread the wine press on the sabbath ; that they be bring in sheaf of grain , load they on their donkey , together with wine , grape , fig , and every other kind of load , and bring they to Jerusalem on the sabbath day . I warn they to sell none of these provision .      in Jerusalem itself the Tyrians reside there be import fish and every other kind of merchandise and sell it to the Judahites on the sabbath .      I reprimand the noble of Judah , demand : what be this evil thing you be do , profane the sabbath day ?      do not your ancestor act in this same way , with the result that our God have bring all this evil upon we and upon this city ? would you add to the wrath against Israel by once more profane the sabbath ?     when the shadow be fall on the gate of Jerusalem before the sabbath , I order the door to be close and prohibit their reopening until after the sabbath . I post some of my own people at the gate so that no load might enter on the sabbath day .      the merchant and seller of various kind of merchandise spend the night once or twice outside Jerusalem ,      but then I warn they : why do you spend the night alongside the wall ? if you keep this up , I will beat you ! from that time on , they do not return on the sabbath .      then I order the Levites to purify themselves and to watch the gate , so that the sabbath day might be keep holy . this , too , remember in my favor , my God , and have mercy on I in accordance with your great mercy !    Mixed Marriages .      also in those day I see Jews who have marry woman of Ashdod , Ammon , or Moab .      of their child , half speak the language of Ashdod ,    or of one of the other people , and none of they know how to speak the language of Judah .      so I reprimand and curse they ; I beat some of their man and pull out their hair ; and I adjure they by God : you shall not marry your daughter to their son nor accept any of their daughter for your son or for yourself !       do not Solomon , the king of Israel , sin because of they ? though among the many nation there be no king like he , and though he be belove of his God and God have make he king over all Israel , yet even he be lead into sin by foreign woman .      must it also be hear of you that you have do this same terrible evil , betray our God by marry foreign woman ?      one of the son of Joiada , son of Eliashib the high priest , be the son - in - law of Sanballat the Horonite ! I drive he from my presence .      remember against they , my God , how they defile the priesthood and the covenant of the priesthood and the Levites !     so I cleanse they of all foreign contamination . I establish the various function for the priest and levite , so that each have an appoint task .       I also provide for the procurement of wood at state time and for the first fruit . remember this in my favor , my God !             '
