b ' prayer of Innocence   of David . I judge I ,   Lord !   for I have walk in my integrity .   in the   Lord   I trust ;   I do not falter .   examine I , Lord , and test I ;   search my heart and mind .    your mercy be before my eye ;   I walk guide by your faithfulness .     II   I do not sit with worthless man ,   nor with hypocrite do I mingle .   I hate an evil assembly ;   with the wicked I do not sit .   I will wash my hand    in innocence    so that I may process around your altar , Lord ,   to hear the sound of thanksgiving ,   and recount all your wondrous deed .   Lord , I love the refuge of your house ,   the site of the dwelling - place of your glory .     III   do not take I away with sinner ,   nor my life with the man of blood ,    in whose hand there be a plot ,   their right hand full of bribery .   but I walk in my integrity ;    redeem I , be gracious to I !    my foot stand on level ground ;    in assembly I will bless the   Lord .
