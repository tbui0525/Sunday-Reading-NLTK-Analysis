Wail in the night ,   at the start of every watch ; pour out your heart like water   before the Lord ; lift up your hand to he   for the life of your child , who collapse from hunger   at the corner of every street .      look , o   Lord , and pay attention :   to whom have you be so ruthless ? must woman eat their own offspring ,    the very child they have bear ? be priest and prophet to be slay   in the sanctuary of the Lord ?      they lie on the ground in the street ,   young and old alike ; both my young woman and young man   be cut down by the sword ; you kill they on the day of your wrath ,   slaughter without pity .      you summon as to a feast day   terror on every side ; on the day of the   Lord s wrath ,   none survive or escape . those I have bear and nurture ,   my enemy have utterly destroy .
