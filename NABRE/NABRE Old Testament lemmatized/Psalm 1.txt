b '   true happiness in Gods Law I   bless be the man who do not walk   in the counsel of the wicked , nor stand in the way    of sinner ,   nor sit in company with scoffer .    rather , the law of the   Lord    be his joy ;   and on his law he meditate day and night .    he be like a tree    plant near stream of water ,   that yield its fruit in season ; its leave never wither ;   whatever he do prosper .    II   but not so be the wicked ,    not so !   they be like chaff drive by the wind .    therefore the wicked will not arise at the judgment ,   nor will sinner in the assembly of the just .   because the   Lord   know the way of the just ,    but the way of the wicked lead to ruin .
