b '   Scaly Infection .      the   Lord   say to Moses and Aaron :       when someone have on the skin a mark , lesion , or blotch which appear to develop into a scaly infection , the person shall be bring to Aaron , the priest , or to one of the priest among his son .      if the priest , upon examination of the skin infection , find that the hair on the infection have turn white and the infection itself appear to be deep than the skin ,    it be indeed a scaly infection ; the priest , on see this , shall declare the person unclean .       if , however , the blotch on the skin be white , but do not seem to be deep than the skin , nor have the hair turn white , the priest shall quarantine the afflict person for seven day .        should the priest , upon examination on the seventh day , find that the infection have remain unchanged in color and have not spread on the skin , the priest shall quarantine the person for another seven day .      should the priest , upon examination again on the seventh day , find that the infection be now fade and have not spread on the skin , the priest shall declare the person clean ; it be merely a scab . the person shall wash his garment    and so become clean .      but if , after the person be examine by the priest and declare clean , the scab spread at all on the skin , the person shall once more be examine by the priest .      should the priest , upon examination , find that the scab have indeed spread on the skin , he shall declare the person unclean ; it be a scaly infection .     when someone be afflict with a scaly infection , that person shall be bring to the priest .      should the priest , upon examination , find that there be a white mark on the skin which have turn the hair white and that there be raw flesh in it ,      it be a chronic scaly infection on the skin . the priest shall declare the person unclean without quarantine , since the individual be certainly unclean .       if the scaly infection break out on the skin and , as far as the priest can see , cover all the skin of the afflict person from head to foot ,      should the priest then , upon examination , find that the scaly infection do cover the whole body , he shall declare the afflict person clean ; since the person have turn completely white ; that individual be clean .      but as soon as raw flesh appear , the individual be unclean ;      on observe the raw flesh , the priest shall declare the person unclean , because raw flesh be unclean ; it be a scaly infection .      if , however , the raw flesh again turn white , the person shall return to the priest ;      should the latter , upon examination , find that the infection have indeed turn white , he shall declare the afflict person clean ; the individual be clean .     if a boil appear on a person skin which later heal ,      should now in the place of the boil a white mark or a reddish white blotch develop , the person shall be examine by the priest .      if the latter , upon examination , find that it be deep than the skin and that the hair have turn white , he shall declare the person unclean ; it be a scaly infection that have break out in the boil .      but if the priest , upon examination , find that there be no white hair in it and that it be not deep than the skin and be fade , the priest shall quarantine the person for seven day .      if it have then spread on the skin , the priest shall declare the person unclean ; it be an infection .      but if the blotch remain the same without spread , it be merely the scar of the boil ; the priest shall therefore declare the person clean .     if there be a burn on a person skin , and the burn area now become a reddish white or a white blotch ,      when the priest , upon examination , find that the hair have turn white in the blotch and this seem to be deep than the skin , it be a scaly infection that have break out in the burn ; the priest shall therefore declare the person unclean ; it be a scaly infection .      but if the priest , upon examination , find that there be no white hair in the blotch and that this be not deep than the skin and be fade , the priest shall quarantine the person for seven day .      should the priest , upon examination on the seventh day , find that it have spread at all on the skin , he shall declare the person unclean ; it be a scaly infection .      but if the blotch remain the same without spread on the skin and be fade , it be merely the spot of the burn ; the priest shall therefore declare the person clean , since it be only the scar of the burn .      when a man or a woman have an infection on the head or in the beard ,      should the priest , upon examination , find that the infection appear to be deep than the skin and that there be fine yellow hair in it , the priest shall declare the person unclean ; it be a scall . it be a scaly infection of the head or beard .      but if the priest , upon examine the scall infection , find that it do not appear to be deep than the skin , though the hair in it may not be black , the priest shall quarantine the scall - stricken person for seven day .      should the priest , upon examine the infection on the seventh day find that the scall have not spread and have no yellow hair in it and do not seem to be deep than the skin ,      the person shall shave , but not the scall spot . then the priest shall quarantine the scall - diseased person for another seven day .      if the priest , upon examine the scall on the seventh day , find that it have not spread on the skin and that it do not appear to be deep than the skin , he shall declare the person clean ; the latter shall wash his garment , and will thus be clean .      but if the scall spread at all on the skin after the person have be declare clean\xe2\x80\x94      should the priest , upon examination , find that the scall have indeed spread on the skin , he need not look for yellow hair ; the individual be unclean .      if , however , the scall have remain unchanged in color and black hair have grow in it , the disease have be heal ; the person be clean , and the priest shall declare the individual clean .      when the skin of a man or a woman be spot with several white blotch ,      if the priest , upon examination , find that the blotch on the skin be pale white , it be only tetter that have break out on the skin , and the person therefore be clean .     when a man lose the hair of his head , he be simply bald on the crown and not unclean .        so too , if he lose the hair on the front of his head , he be simply bald on the forehead and not unclean .      but when there be a reddish white infection on his bald crown or bald forehead , it be a scaly infection that be break out there .      if the priest , upon examination , find that the infection spot on the bald area on the crown or forehead have the same reddish white appearance as that of a scaly infection of the skin ,      the man have a scaly infection and be unclean . the priest shall declare he unclean ; his infection be on his head .      the garment of one afflict with a scaly infection shall be rent and the hair dishevel ,    and the mustache cover .    the individual shall cry out , unclean , unclean !      as long as the infection be present , the person shall be unclean . be unclean , that individual shall dwell apart , take up residence outside the camp .     Fungal Infection of Fabrics and Leather .     when a fungal infection be on a garment of wool or of linen ,      or on the warp and woof    of linen or wool , or on a hide or anything make of leather ,      if the infection on the garment or hide , or on the warp or woof , or on any leather article be greenish or reddish , the thing be indeed a fungal infection and must be examine by the priest .      having examine the infection , the priest shall quarantine the infect article for seven day .      if the priest , upon inspect the infection on the seventh day , find that it have spread on the garment , or on the warp or woof , or on the leather , whatever be its use , the infection be a harmful fungus ; the article be unclean .      he shall therefore burn up the garment , or the warp or woof , be it of wool or linen , or any leather article which be infect ; since it be a harmful fungus , it must be destroy by fire .      but if the priest , upon examination , find that it have not spread on the garment , or on the warp or woof , or on the leather article ,      he shall give order to have the infect article wash and then quarantine for another seven day .      if the priest , upon examination after the infection be wash , find that it have not change its color , even though it may not have spread , the article be unclean . you shall burn it with fire . it be a fray , be it on its inner or outer side .      but if the priest , upon examination , find that the infection have fade after the washing , he shall cut it out of the garment , or the leather , or the warp or woof .      if , however , the infection again appear on the garment , or on the warp or woof , or on the leather article , it be still virulent and you shall burn the thing infect with fire .      but if , after the washing , the infection have disappear from the garment , or the warp or woof , or the leather article , the thing shall be wash a second time , and thus it will be clean .      this be the instruction for a fungal    infection on a garment of wool or linen , or on a warp or woof , or on any leather article , to determine whether it be clean or unclean .
