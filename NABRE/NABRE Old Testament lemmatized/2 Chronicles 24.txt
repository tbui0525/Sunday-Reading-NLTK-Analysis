b '   the Temple restore .      Joash be seven year old when he become king , and he reign forty year in Jerusalem . his mother name be Zibiah , from beer - sheba .      Joash do what be right in the   Lord s sight as long as Jehoiada the priest live .      Jehoiada provide he with two wife , and he become the father of son and daughter .     after some time , Joash decide to restore the house of the   Lord .      he gather together the priest and Levites and say to they : go out to all the city of Judah and gather money    from all Israel that you may repair the house of your God over the year . you must hurry this project . but the Levites do not .      then the king summon Jehoiada , who be in charge , and say to he : why have you not require the Levites to bring in from Judah and Jerusalem the tax levy by Moses , the servant of the   Lord , and by the assembly of Israel , for the tent of the testimony ?        for the wicked Athaliah and her son have damage the house of God and have even turn over to the Baals the holy thing of the   Lord s house .     at the king command , therefore , they make a chest , which they put outside the gate of the   Lord s house .        they have it proclaim throughout Judah and Jerusalem that the tax which Moses , the servant of God , have impose on Israel in the wilderness should be bring to the   Lord .        all the prince and the people rejoice ; they bring what be ask and cast it into the chest until it be fill .      whenever the chest be bring to the royal official by the Levites and they notice that there be a large amount of money , the royal scribe and an overseer for the chief priest would come up , empty the chest , and then take it back and return it to its place . this they do day after day until they have collect a large sum of money .      then the king and Jehoiada give it to the worker in charge of the labor on the   Lord s house , who hire mason and carpenter to restore the   Lord s house , and also iron- and bronze - smith to repair it .      the worker labor , and the task of restoration progress under their hand . they restore the house of God accord to its original form , and reinforce it .      after they have finish , they bring the rest of the money to the king and to Jehoiada , who have it make into utensil for the house of the   Lord , utensil for the service and the burn offering , and basin and other gold and silver utensil .    they sacrifice burn offering in the   Lord s house continually all the day of Jehoiada .      Jehoiada grow old , full of year , and die ; he be a hundred and thirty year old .      they bury he in the City of David with the king , because of the good he have do in Israel , especially for God and his house .    Joashs Apostasy .     after the death of Jehoiada , the prince of Judah come and pay homage to the king ; then the king listen to they .      they abandon the house of the   Lord , the God of their ancestor , and begin to serve the asherah and the idol ;    and because of this crime of theirs , wrath come upon Judah and Jerusalem .      although prophet be send to they to turn they back to the   Lord   and to warn they , the people would not listen .       then the spirit of God clothe Zechariah , son of Jehoiada the priest . he take his stand above the people and say to they : thus say God , why be you transgress the   Lord s command , so that you can not prosper ? because you have abandon the   Lord , he have abandon you .      but they conspire against he , and at the king command they stone he in the court of the house of the   Lord .      thus King Joash be unmindful of the devotion show he by Jehoiada , Zechariahs father , and kill the son . as he be die , he say , may the   Lord   see and avenge .    Joash punish .     at the turn of the year a force of Arameans come up against Joash . they invade Judah and Jerusalem , kill all the prince of the people , and send all their spoil to the king of Damascus .        though the aramean force be small , the   Lord   hand over a very large force into their power ,    because Judah have abandon the   Lord , the God of their ancestor . so judgment be mete out to Joash .       after the Arameans have depart from he , abandon he to his many injury , his servant conspire against he because of the murder of the son of Jehoiada the priest . they kill he on his sickbed . he be bury in the City of David , but not in the tomb of the king .     those who conspire against he be Zabad , son of Shimeath from Ammon , and Jehozabad , son of Shimrith from Moab .      an account of his son , the great tribute impose on he , and his rebuilding of the house of God be write in the midrash of the book of the king . his son Amaziah succeed he as king .
