b '     when you sit down to dine with a ruler ,   mark well the one who be before you ;   stick the knife in your gullet    if you have a ravenous appetite .   do not desire his delicacy ;   it be food that deceive .   do not wear yourself out to gain wealth ,   cease to be worried about it ;   when your glance flit to it , it be go !   for assuredly it grow wing ,   like the eagle that fly toward heaven .     do not take food with unwilling host ,   and do not desire their delicacy ;   for like something stick in the throat be that food . eat and drink , they say to you ,   but their heart be not with you ;   the little you have eat you will vomit up ,   and you will have waste your agreeable word .   do not speak in the hearing of fool ;   they will despise the wisdom of your word .    do not remove the ancient landmark ,    nor invade the field of the fatherless ;    for their redeemer be strong ;   he will defend their cause against you .    apply your heart to instruction ,   and your ear to word of knowledge .    do not withhold discipline from youth ;   if you beat they with the rod , they will not die .    beat they with the rod ,    and you will save they from Sheol .   my son , if your heart be wise ,   my heart also will rejoice ;   and my inmost being will exult ,   when your lip speak what be right .   do not let your heart envy sinner ,    but only those who always fear the   Lord ;    for you will surely have a future ,   and your hope will not be cut off .    hear , my son , and be wise ,   and guide your heart in the right way .   do not join with wine bibber ,   nor with those who glut themselves on meat .   for drunkard and glutton come to poverty ,   and laze about clothe one in rag .    listen to your father who begot you ,   do not despise your mother when she be old .   buy truth and do not sell :   wisdom , instruction , understanding !   the father of a just person will exult greatly ;   whoever beget a wise son will rejoice in he .    let your father and mother rejoice ;   let she who bear you exult .    my son , give I your heart ,   and let your eye keep to my way ,   for the harlot be a deep pit ,   and the foreign woman a narrow well ;   yes , she lie in wait like a robber ,    and increase the number of the faithless .    who scream ? who shout ?   who have strife ? who have anxiety ? who have wound for nothing ?   who have bleary eye ?   whoever linger long over wine ,   whoever go around quaff wine .    do not look on the wine when it be red ,   when it sparkle in the cup . it go down smoothly ,    but in the end it bite like a serpent ,   and sting like an adder .   your eye behold strange sight ,   and your heart utter incoherent thing ;   you be like one sleep on the high sea ,   sprawl at the top of the mast .   they strike I , but it do not pain I ;   they beat I , but I do not feel it . when can I get up ,   when can I go out and get more ?
