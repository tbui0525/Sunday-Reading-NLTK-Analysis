b ' disobedience of Saul .     Samuel say to Saul : it be I the   Lord   send to anoint you king over his people Israel . now , therefore , listen to the message of the   Lord .        thus say the   Lord   of host : I will punish what Amalek do to the Israelites when he bar their way as they come up from Egypt .        go , now , attack Amalek , and put under the ban    everything he have . do not spare he ; kill man and woman , child and infant , oxen and sheep , camel and donkey .      Saul alert the army , and at Telaim review two hundred thousand foot soldier and ten thousand man of Judah .        Saul go to the city of Amalek and set up an ambush in the wadi .       he warn the Kenites : leave Amalek , turn aside and come down so I will not have to destroy you with they , for you be loyal to the Israelites when they come up from Egypt .    after the Kenites leave ,      Saul route Amalek from Havilah to the approach of Shur , on the frontier of Egypt .        he take Agag , king of Amalek , alive , but the rest of the people he destroy by the sword , put they under the ban .      he and his troop spare Agag and the good of the fat sheep and oxen , and the lamb . they refuse to put under the ban anything that be worthwhile , destroy only what be worthless and of no account .    Samuel Rebukes Saul .     then the word of the   Lord   come to Samuel :      I regret having make Saul king , for he have turn from I and have not keep my command . at this Samuel grow angry and cry out to the   Lord   all night .        early in the morning he go to meet Saul , but be inform that Saul have go to Carmel , where he set up a monument in his own honor , and that on his return he have go down to Gilgal .      when Samuel come to he , Saul greet he : the   Lord   bless you ! I have keep the command of the   Lord .      but Samuel ask , what , then , be this bleating of sheep that come to my ear , the lowing of oxen that I hear ?      Saul reply : they be bring from Amalek . the people spare the good sheep and oxen to sacrifice to the   Lord , your God ; but the rest we destroy , put they under the ban .      Samuel say to Saul : stop ! let I tell you what the   Lord   say to I last night . speak ! he reply .      Samuel then say : though little in your own eye , be you not chief of the tribe of Israel ? the   Lord   anoint you king of Israel        and send you on a mission , say : go and put the sinful Amalekites under a ban of destruction . fight against they until you have exterminate they .        why then have you disobey the   Lord ? you have pounce on the spoil , thus do what be evil in the   Lord s sight .        Saul explain to Samuel : I do indeed obey the   Lord   and fulfill the mission on which the   Lord   send I . I have bring back Agag , the king of Amalek , and , carry out the ban , I have destroy the Amalekites .      but from the spoil the army take sheep and oxen , the good of what have be ban , to sacrifice to the   Lord   your God in Gilgal .         but Samuel say : do the   Lord   delight in burn offering and sacrifice   as much as in obedience to the   Lord s command ? obedience be well than sacrifice ,   to listen , well than the fat of ram .    for a sin of divination be rebellion ,   and arrogance , the crime of idolatry . because you have reject the word of the   Lord ,   the   Lord   in turn have reject you as king .     Rejection of Saul .     Saul admit to Samuel : I have sin , for I have transgress the command of the   Lord   and your instruction . I fear the people and obey they .        now forgive my sin , and return with I , that I may worship the   Lord .      but Samuel say to Saul , I will not return with you , because you reject the word of the   Lord   and the   Lord   have reject you as king of Israel .        as Samuel turn to go , Saul seize a loose end of his garment , and it tear off .        so Samuel say to he : the   Lord   have tear the kingdom of Israel from you this day , and have give it to a neighbor of yours , who be well than you .        the Glory of Israel neither deceive nor repent ,    for he be not a mortal who repent .        but Saul answer : I have sin , yet honor I now before the elder of my people and before Israel . return with I that I may worship the   Lord   your God .      and so Samuel return with he , and Saul worship the   Lord .    Samuel execute Agag .     afterward Samuel command , bring Agag , king of Amalek , to I . Agag come to he struggle and say , so it be bitter death !      and Samuel say , as your sword have make woman childless ,   so shall your mother be childless among woman . then he cut Agag to piece before the   Lord   in Gilgal .        Samuel depart for Ramah , while Saul go up to his home in Gibeah of Saul .      never again , as long as he live , do Samuel see Saul . yet he grieve over Saul , because the   Lord   repent that he have make he king of Israel .
