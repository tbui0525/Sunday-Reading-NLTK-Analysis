b '    M    I have come to my garden , my sister , my bride ;   I gather my myrrh with my spice , I eat my honeycomb with my honey ,   I drink my wine with my milk . d ?   eat , friend ; drink !   drink deeply , lover !     a Fruitless Search   W    I be sleep , but my heart be awake .    the sound of my lover knock ! open to I , my sister , my friend ,   my dove , my perfect one ! for my head be wet with dew ,   my hair , with the moisture of the night .   I have take off my robe ,    be I then to put it on ? I have bathe my foot ,   be I then to soil they ?   my lover put his hand in through the opening :   my innermost being    tremble because of he .   I rise to open for my lover ,   my hand drip myrrh : my finger , flow myrrh   upon the handle of the lock .   I open for my lover\xe2\x80\x94   but my lover have turn and go !   at his leaving , my soul sink . I seek he , but I do not find he ;   I call out after he , but he do not answer I .    the watchman    find I ,   as they make their round in the city ; they beat I , they wound I ,   they tear off my mantle ,   the watchman of the wall .    I adjure you , daughter of Jerusalem ,   if you find my lover what shall you tell he ?   that I be sick with love .    the lost lover describe   D   how do your lover differ from any other lover ,   most beautiful among woman ? how do your lover differ from any other ,   that you adjure we so ?   W   my lover be radiant and ruddy ;    outstanding among thousand .   his head be gold , pure gold ,   his hair like palm frond ,   as black as a raven .   his eye be like dove   beside stream of water , bathe in milk ,   sit    by brim pool .   his cheek be like bed of spice   yield aromatic scent ; his lip be lily   that drip flow myrrh .   his arm be rod of gold   adorn with gem ; his loin , a work of ivory   cover with sapphire .   his leg , pillar of alabaster ,   rest on golden pedestal . his appearance , like the Lebanon ,   impose as the cedar .   his mouth be sweetness itself ;   he be delightful in every way . such be my lover , and such my friend ,   daughter of Jerusalem !
