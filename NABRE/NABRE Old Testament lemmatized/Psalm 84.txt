b ' prayer of a Pilgrim to Jerusalem   for the leader ; upon the   gittith . a psalm of the Korahites .    I   how lovely your dwelling ,   O   Lord   of host !    my soul yearn and pine   for the court of the   Lord .   my heart and flesh cry out   for the live God .    as the sparrow find a home   and the swallow a nest to settle her young , my home be by your altar ,   Lord   of host , my king and my God !    bless be those who dwell in your house !   they never cease to praise you . Selah    II   bless the man who find refuge in you ,   in their heart be pilgrim road .   as they pass through the Baca valley ,    they find spring water to drink .   the early rain cover it with blessing .   they will go from strength to strength    and see the God of god on Zion .    III   Lord   God of host , hear my prayer ;   listen , God of Jacob . Selah    o God , watch over our shield ;   look upon the face of your anoint .     IV   well one day in your court   than a thousand elsewhere . well the threshold of the house of my God   than a home in the tent of the wicked .   for a sun and shield be the   Lord   God ,   bestow all grace and glory . the   Lord   withhold no good thing   from those who walk without reproach .   o   Lord   of host ,   bless the man who trust in you !
