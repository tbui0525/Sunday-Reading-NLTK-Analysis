b '    the Vision : God on the Cherubim .     in the thirtieth year ,    on the fifth day of the fourth month , while I be among the exile by the river Chebar , the heaven open , and I see divine vision .   \xe2\x80\x94      on the fifth day of the month\xe2\x80\x94this be the fifth year    of King Jehoiachins exile   \xe2\x80\x94      the word of the   Lord   come to the priest Ezekiel , the son of Buzi , in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar . there the hand of the   Lord   come upon he .      as I watch , a great stormwind come from the North ,    a large cloud with flash fire , a bright glow all around it , and something like polished metal gleam at the center of the fire .        from within it figure in the likeness of four live creature    appear . this be what they look like :        they be in human form , but each have four face and four wing ,        and their leg be straight , the sol of their foot like the hoof of a bull , gleam like polished brass .        human hand be under their wing , and the wing of one touch those of another .        their face and their wing look out on all their four side ; they do not turn when they move , but each go straight ahead .       their face be like this :    each of the four have a human face , and on the right the face of a lion , and on the left , the face of an ox , and each have the face of an eagle .      such be their face . their wing be spread out above . on each one , two wing touch one another , and the other two wing cover the body .        each go straight ahead . wherever the spirit would go , they go ; they do not change direction when they move .         and the appearance of the living creature seem like burn coal of fire . something indeed like torch move back and forth among the living creature . the fire gleam intensely , and from it lightning flash .      the creature dart back and forth flash like lightning .      as I look at the living creature , I see wheel on the ground , one alongside each of the four living creature .        the wheel and their construction sparkle like yellow topaz , and all four of they look the same : their construction seem as though one wheel be inside the other .      when they move , they go in any of the four direction without veer as they move .       the four of they have rim , high and fearsome\xe2\x80\x94eyes fill the four rim all around .      when the live creature move , the wheel move with they ; and when the living creature be raise from the ground , the wheel also be raise .      wherever the spirit would go , they go . and they be raise up together with the living creature , for the spirit of the living creature be in the wheel .      wherever the live creature move , the wheel move ; when they stand still , the wheel stand still . when they be lift up from the earth , the wheel be lift up with they .    for the spirit of the living creature be in the wheel .      above the head of the living creature be a likeness of the firmament ; it be awesome , stretch upwards like shine crystal over their head .        beneath the firmament their wing stretch out toward one another ; each have two wing cover the body .      then I hear the sound of their wing , like the roaring of mighty water , like the voice of the Almighty . when they move , the sound of the tumult be like the din of an army . and when they stand still , they lower their wing .        while they stand with their wing lower , a voice come from above the firmament over their head .     above the firmament over their head be the likeness of a throne that look like sapphire ; and upon this likeness of a throne be seat , up above , a figure that look like a human being .         and I see something like polished metal , like the appearance of fire enclose on all side , from what look like the waist up ; and from what look like the waist down , I see something like the appearance of fire and brilliant light surround he .        just like the appearance of the rainbow in the cloud on a rainy day so be the appearance of brilliance that surround he . such be the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the   Lord . and when I see it , I fall on my face and hear a voice speak .
