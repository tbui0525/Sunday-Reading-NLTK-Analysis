b '   death for the remnant in Jerusalem .     the spirit lift I up and bring I to the east gate of the house of the   Lord   face east . there at the entrance of the gate be twenty - five man ; among they I see the public official Jaazaniah , son of Azzur , and Pelatiah , son of Benaiah .      the   Lord   say to I : Son of man , these be the man who be plan evil and give wicked counsel in this city .      they be say , no need to build house ! the city be the pot , and we be the meat .         therefore prophesy against they , son of man , prophesy !      then the spirit of the   Lord   fall upon I and tell I to say : thus say the   Lord : this be how you talk , house of Israel . I know the thing that come into your mind !      you have slay many in this city , fill its street with the slay .      therefore thus say the Lord   God : the slain whom you pile up in it , that be the meat , the pot be the city . but you I will bring out of it .        you fear the sword\xe2\x80\x94that sword I will bring upon you\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the Lord   God .        I will bring you out of the city , hand you over to foreigner , and execute judgment against you .      by the sword you shall fall . at the border of Israel I will judge you so that you will know that I be the   Lord .      the city shall not be a pot for you , nor shall you be meat within it . at the border of Israel I will judge you ,        so you shall know that I be the   Lord , whose statute you do not follow , whose ordinance you do not keep . instead , you act accord to the ordinance of the nation around you .     while I be prophesy , Pelatiah , the son of Benaiah , drop dead . I fall down on my face and cry out in a loud voice : alas , Lord   God ! you be finish off what remain of Israel !      Restoration for the Exiles .     the word of the   Lord   come to I :       Son of man , the inhabitant of Jerusalem be say about all your relative , the other exile , and all the house of Israel , they be far away from the   Lord . the land be give to we as a possession .        therefore say : thus say the Lord   God : I have indeed send they far away among the nation , scatter they over the land , and have be but little sanctuary for they in the land to which they have go .      therefore , thus say the Lord   God , I will gather you from the nation and collect you from the land through which you be scatter , so I can give you the land of Israel .        they will enter it and remove all its atrocity and abomination .       and I will give they another heart and a new spirit I will put within they . from their body I will remove the heart of stone , and give they heart of flesh ,      so that they walk accord to my statute , take care to keep my ordinance . thus they will be my people , and I will be their God .        but as for those whose heart be devoted to their atrocity and abomination , I will bring their conduct down upon their heads\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the Lord   God .     then the cherubim lift their wing and the wheel alongside they , with the glory of the God of Israel above they .         the glory of the   Lord   rise up from the middle of the city and come to rest on the mountain east of the city .        in a vision , the spirit lift I up and bring I back to the exile in Chaldea , by the spirit of God . the vision I have see leave I ,        and I tell the exile everything the   Lord   have show I .
