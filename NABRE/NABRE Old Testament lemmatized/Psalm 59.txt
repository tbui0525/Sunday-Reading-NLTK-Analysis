b ' complaint against Bloodthirsty enemy   for the director . do not destroy .    a   miktam   of David , when Saul send people to watch his house and kill he .     I   Rescue I from my enemy , my God ;   lift I out of reach of my foe .   deliver I from evildoer ;   from the bloodthirsty save I .   they have set an ambush for my life ;   the powerful conspire against I . for no offense or misdeed of mine ,   Lord ,    for no fault they hurry to take up arm . come near and see my plight !    you ,   Lord   God of host , be the God of Israel ! awake ! punish all the nation .   have no mercy on these worthless traitor . Selah   each evening they return ,   growl like dog , prowl the city .    their mouth pour out insult ;   sharp word be on their lip .   they say : who be there to hear ?    but you ,   Lord , laugh at they ;   you deride all the nation .    my strength , for you I watch ;   you , God , be my fortress ,    my love God . II may God go before I ,   and show I my fallen foe .   slay they , God ,   lest they deceive my people . shake they by your power ;   Lord , our shield , bring they down .   for the sinful word of their mouth and lip   let they be catch in their pride . for the lie they have tell under oath     destroy they in anger ,   destroy till they be no more . then people will know God rule over Jacob ,   yes , even to the end of the earth .   Selah   each evening they return ,   growl like dog , prowl the city .   they roam about as scavenger ;   if they be not fill , they howl .    III   but I shall sing of your strength ,   extol your mercy at dawn , for you be my fortress ,   my refuge in time of trouble .   my strength , your praise I will sing ;   you , God , be my fortress , my love God .
