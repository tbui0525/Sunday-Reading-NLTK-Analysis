b '    therefore they    be fittingly punish by similar creature ,   and be torment by a swarm of insect .    instead of this punishment , you benefit your people   with a novel dish , the delight they crave ,   by provide quail for their food ,    so that those other , when they desire food ,   should lose their appetite even for necessity ,   since the creature send to plague they be so loathsome , while these , after a brief period of privation ,   partake of a novel dish .    for inexorable want have to come upon those oppressor ;   but these need only to be show how their enemy be be torment .      for when the dire venom of beast come upon they    and they be die from the bite of crooked serpent ,   your anger endure not to the end .   but as a warning , for a short time they be terrorize ,   though they have a sign    of salvation , to remind they of the precept of your law .   for the one who turn toward it be save ,   not by what be see ,   but by you , the savior of all .   by this also you convince our foe   that you be the one who deliver from all evil .    for the bite of locust and of fly slew they ,   and no remedy be find to save their life   because they deserve to be punish by such mean ;    but not even the fang of poisonous reptile overcome your child ,   for your mercy come forth and heal they .    for as a reminder of your injunction , they be sting ,   and swiftly they be save , lest they should fall into deep forgetfulness   and become unresponsive to your beneficence .    for indeed , neither herb nor application cure they ,   but your all - heal word , o   Lord !     for you have dominion over life and death ;    you lead down to the gate of Hades and lead back .   human being , however , may kill another with malice ,   but they can not bring back the depart spirit ,   or release the soul that death have confine .   your hand no one can escape .    Third example : a rain of Manna for Israel instead of the plague of storm   for the wicked who refuse to know you   be punish by the might of your arm , be pursue by unusual rain and hailstorm and unremitting downpour ,   and be consume by fire .    for against all expectation , in water which quench everything ,   the fire grow more active ; for the universe fight on behalf of the righteous .    then the flame be temper    so that the beast that be send upon the wicked might not be burn up ,   but that these might see and know that they be strike by the judgment of God ;   and again , even in the water , fire blaze beyond its strength   so as to consume the produce of the wicked land .   instead of this , you nourish your people with food of angel    and furnish they bread from heaven , ready to hand , untoiled - for ,   endow with all delight and conform to every taste .    for this substance of yours reveal your sweetness toward your child ,   and serve the desire of the one who receive it ,   be change to whatever flavor each one wish .    yet snow and ice    withstand fire and be not melt ,   so that they might know that their enemy fruit be consume by a fire that blaze in the hail   and flash lightning in the rain .      but this fire , again , in order that the righteous might be nourish ,   forget even its proper strength ;    for your creation , serve you , its maker ,   grow tense for punishment against the wicked ,   but be relax in benefit for those who trust in you .    therefore at that very time , transform in all sort of way ,   it be serve your all - nourish bounty   accord to what they need and desire ;   that your child whom you love might learn , o   Lord ,   that it be not the various kind of fruit that nourish ,   but your word that preserve those who believe you !    for what be not destroy by fire ,   melt when merely warm by a momentary sunbeam ;    to make known that one must give you thank before sunrise ,   and turn to you at daybreak .    for the hope of the ungrateful melt like a wintry frost   and run off like useless water .
