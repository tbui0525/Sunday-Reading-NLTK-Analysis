b '   chapter 7 Critique of Sages on the Day of Adversity   a good name be well than good ointment ,    and the day of death than the day of birth .    it be well to go to the house of mourning   than to the house of feasting , for that be the end of every mortal ,   and the living should take it to heart .    Sorrow be well than laughter ;   when the face be sad , the heart grow wise .   the heart of the wise be in the house of mourning ,   but the heart of fool be in the house of merriment .   it be well to listen to the rebuke of the wise   than to listen to the song of fool ;   for as the crackling of thorn under a pot ,   so be the fool laughter . this also be vanity .   extortion can make a fool out of the wise ,   and a bribe corrupt the heart .   well be the end of a thing than its beginning ;   well be a patient spirit than a lofty one .   do not let anger upset your spirit ,   for anger lodge in the bosom of a fool .     do not say : how be it that former time be well than these ? for it be not out of wisdom that you ask about this .     wisdom be as good as an inheritance   and profitable to those who see the sun .      for the protection of wisdom be as the protection of money ; and knowledge be profitable because wisdom give life to those who possess it .     consider the work of God . who can make straight what God have make crooked ?        on a good day enjoy good thing , and on an evil day consider : both the one and the other God have make , so that no one may find the least fault with he .    Critique of Sages on Justice and Wickedness .      I have see all manner of thing in my vain day : the just perish in their justice , and the wicked live long in their wickedness .      be not just to excess , and be not overwise . why work your own ruin ?      be not wicked to excess , and be not foolish . why should you die before your time ?      it be good to hold to this rule , and not to let that one go ; but the one who fear God will succeed with both .     wisdom be a well defense for the wise than ten prince in the city ,       yet there be no one on earth so just as to do good and never sin .      do not give your heart to every word that be speak ; you may hear your servant curse you ,      for your heart know that you have many time curse other .     all these thing I probe in wisdom . I say , I will acquire wisdom ; but it be far beyond I .      what exist be far - reach ; it be deep , very deep :    who can find it out ?        I turn my heart toward knowledge ; I seek and pursue wisdom and its design , and I recognize that wickedness be foolishness and folly be madness .    critique of Advice on Women .      more bitter than death I find the woman    who be a hunter trap , whose heart be a snare , whose hand be prison bond . the one who please God will be deliver from she , but the one who displease will be entrap by she .      see , this have I find , say Qoheleth , add one to one to find the sum .      what my soul still seek and have yet to find be this : one man out of a thousand have I find , but a woman among they all I have not find .      but this alone I have find : God make humankind honest , but they have pursue many design .
