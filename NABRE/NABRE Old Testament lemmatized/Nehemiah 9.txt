b '   Public Confession of Sin .       on the twenty - fourth day of this month , the Israelites gather together while fast and wear sackcloth , their head cover with dust .       those of israelite descent separate themselves from all who be of foreign extraction , then stand forward and confess their sin and the guilty deed of their ancestor .      when they have take their place , they read from the book of the law of the   Lord   their God , for a fourth of the day , and during another fourth they make their confession and bow down before the   Lord   their God .      stand on the platform of the Levites be Jeshua , Binnui , Kadmiel , Shebaniah , Bunni , Sherebiah , Bani , and Chenani , who cry out to the   Lord   their God , with a loud voice .       the Levites Jeshua , Kadmiel , Bani , Hashabneiah , Sherebiah , Hodiah , Shebaniah , and Pethahiah say , Arise , bless the   Lord , your God ,   from eternity to eternity ! and may they bless your glorious name ,   which be exalt above all blessing and praise .    you be the   Lord , you alone ; you make the heavens ,   the high heaven and all their host , the earth and all that be upon it ,   the sea and all that be in they . to all of they you give life ,   the heavenly host bow down before you .    you be the   Lord   God   who choose Abram , who bring he from Ur of the Chaldees ,   who name he Abraham .    you find his heart faithful in your sight ,   you make the covenant with he to give the land of the Canaanites ,   Hittites , Amorites , Perizzites , Jebusites , and Girgashites   to he and his descendant . you fulfil your promise ,   for you be just .    you see the affliction of our ancestor in Egypt ,   you hear their cry by the Red Sea ;    you work sign and wonder against Pharaoh ,   against all his servant and the people of his land , because you know of their insolence toward they ;   thus you make for yourself a name even to this day .    the sea you divide before they ,   on dry ground they pass through the midst of the sea ; their pursuer you hurl into the depth ,   like a stone into the mighty water .    with a column of cloud you lead they by day ,   and by night with a column of fire , to light the way of their journey ,   the way in which they must travel .    on Mount Sinai you come down ,   you speak with they from heaven ; you give they just ordinance , true law ,   good statute and commandment ;    your holy sabbath you make known to they ,   commandment , statute , and law you prescribe for they ,   by the hand of Moses your servant .    Food from heaven you give they in their hunger ,   water from a rock you send they in their thirst . you tell they to enter and occupy the land   which you have swear to give they .   but they , our ancestor , prove to be insolent ;   they be obdurate    and do not obey your commandment .    they refuse to obey and no long remember   the wonder you have work for they . they be obdurate and appoint a leader   in order to return to their slavery in Egypt . but you be a forgiving God , gracious and merciful ,   slow to anger and rich in mercy ;   you do not forsake they .    though they make for themselves a molten calf ,   and proclaim , here be your God who bring you up from Egypt ,   and be guilty of great insult ,   yet in your great mercy   you do not forsake they in the desert . by day the column of cloud do not cease to lead they on their journey ,   by night the column of fire do not cease to light the way they be to travel .    your good spirit you bestow on they ,   to give they understanding ; your manna you do not withhold from their mouth ,   and you give they water in their thirst .    forty year in the desert you sustain they :   they do not want ; their garment do not become worn ,   and their foot do not swell .    you give they kingdom and people ,   which you divide among they as border land . they possess the land of Sihon , king of Heshbon ,   and the land of Og , king of Bashan .    you make their child as numerous as the star of the heavens ,   and you bring they into the land   which you have command their ancestor to enter and possess .   the child go in to possess the land ;   you humble before they the canaanite inhabitant   and give they into their power , their king and the people of the land ,   to do with they as they wish .    they capture fortified city and fertile land ;   they take possession of house fill with all good thing , cistern already dig , vineyard , olive grove ,   and fruit tree in abundance . they eat and have their fill ,   fatten and feast on your great goodness .    but they be contemptuous and rebel against you :   they cast your law behind their back . they murder your prophet   who bear witness against they to bring they back to you :   they be guilty of great insult .    therefore you give they into the power of their enemy ,   who oppress they . but in the time of their oppression they would cry out to you ,   and you would hear they from heaven , and accord to your great mercy give they savior   to deliver they from the power of their enemy .   as soon as they have relief ,   they would go back to do evil in your sight . again you abandon they to the power of their enemy ,   who crush they . once again they cry out to you , and you hear they from heaven   and deliver they accord to your mercy , many time over .    you bore witness against they ,   to bring they back to your law . but they be insolent   and would not obey your commandment ; they sin against your ordinance ,   which give life to those who keep they . they turn stubborn back , stiffen their neck ,   and would not obey .   you be patient with they for many year ,   bear witness against they through your spirit , by mean of your prophet ; still they would not listen .   therefore you deliver they into the power of the people of the land .   yet in your great mercy you do not completely destroy they   and do not forsake they , for you be a gracious and merciful God .    now , our God , great , mighty , and awesome God ,   who preserve the covenant of mercy ,   do not discount all the hardship that have befall we , our king , our prince , our priest ,   our prophet , our ancestor , and your entire people ,   from the time of the king of Assyria until this day !    in all that have come upon we you have be just ,   for you keep faith while we have do evil .   yes , our king , our prince , our priest , and our ancestor   have not keep your law ; they pay no attention to your commandment   and the warning which you give they .   while they be still in their kingdom ,   in the midst of the many good thing that you have give they and in the wide , fertile land   that you have spread out before they , they do not serve you   nor turn away from their evil deed .   today we be slave !   as for the land which you give our ancestor that they might eat its fruit and good things\xe2\x80\x94   see , we have become slave upon it !   its rich produce go to the king   you set over we because of our sin , who rule over our body and our cattle as they please .   we be in great distress !
