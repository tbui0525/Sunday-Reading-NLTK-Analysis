b '   Perversion of Justice    Ah ! those who enact unjust statute ,   who write oppressive decree ,    deprive the needy of judgment ,   rob my people poor of justice , make widow their plunder ,   and orphan their prey !    what will you do on the day of punishment ,   when the storm come from afar ? to whom will you flee for help ?   where will you leave your wealth ,   lest it sink beneath the captive   or fall beneath the slay ? for all this , his wrath be not turn back ,   his hand be still outstretche !     judgment on Assyria    Ah ! Assyria , the rod of my wrath ,   the staff I wield in anger .    against an impious nation    I send he ,   and against a people under my wrath I order he to seize plunder , carry off loot ,   and to trample they like the mud of the street .   but this be not what he intend ,   nor do he have this in mind ; rather , it be in his heart to destroy ,   to make an end of not a few nation .   for he say , be not my commander all king ?     be not calno like carchemish , or Hamath like Arpad ,   or Samaria like Damascus ?   just as my hand reach out to idolatrous kingdom   that have more image than Jerusalem and Samaria\xe2\x80\x94   just as I treat Samaria and her idol ,   shall I not do to Jerusalem and her graven image ?     but when the   Lord   have bring to an end all his work on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem , I will punish the utterance   of the king of Assyrias proud heart ,   and the boastfulness of his haughty eye .   for he say : by my own power I have do it ,   and by my wisdom , for I be shrewd . I have move the boundary of people ,   their treasure I have pillage ,   and , like a mighty one , I have bring down the enthrone .   my hand have seize , like a nest ,   the wealth of nation . as one take egg leave alone ,   so I take in all the earth ; no one flutter a wing ,   or open a mouth , or chirp !   will the ax boast against the one who hew with it ?   will the saw exalt itself above the one who wield it ? as if a rod could sway the one who lift it ,   or a staff could lift the one who be not wood !   therefore the Lord , the   Lord   of host ,   will send leanness among his fat one ,   and under his glory there will be a kindling   like the kindling of fire .    the Light of Israel will become a fire ,   the Holy One , a flame , that burn and consume its brier   and its thorn in a single day .    and the glory of its forest and orchard   will be consume , soul and body ,   and it will be like a sick man who waste away .   and the remnant of the tree in his forest   will be so few ,   that any child can record they .    on that day the remnant of Israel ,   the survivor of the house of Jacob ,   will no more lean upon the one who strike they ; but they will lean upon the   Lord ,   the Holy One of Israel , in truth .   a remnant will return ,    the remnant of Jacob ,   to the mighty God .   though your people , o Israel ,   be like the sand of the sea ,   only a remnant of they will return ;   their destruction be decree ,   as overflow justice demand .      for the Lord , the   God   of host , be about to carry out the destruction decree in the midst of the whole land .       therefore thus say the Lord , the   God   of host : my people , who dwell in Zion , do not fear the assyrian , though he strike you with a rod , and raise his staff against you as do the Egyptians .      for just a brief moment more , and my wrath shall be over , and my anger shall be set for their destruction .      then the   Lord   of host will raise against they a scourge such as strike Midian at the rock of Oreb ;    and he will raise his staff over the sea as he do in Egypt .        on that day , his burden shall be take from your shoulder ,   and his yoke shatter from your neck .   the March of an Enemy Army   he have come up from Rimmon ,    he have reach Aiath , pass through Migron ,   at Michmash he have store his supply .   he have cross the ravine ,   at Geba he have camp for the night . Ramah tremble ,   Gibeah of Saul have flee .   cry and shriek , bath - Gallim !   Hearken , Laishah ! answer she , Anathoth !   Madmenah be in flight ,   the inhabitant of Gebim seek refuge .   even today he will halt at Nob ,   he will shake his fist at the mount of daughter Zion ,   the hill of Jerusalem !    now the Lord , the   Lord   of host ,   be about to lop off the bough with terrible violence ; the tall of stature shall be fell ,   and the lofty one shall be bring low ;   he shall hack down the forest thicket with an ax ,   and Lebanon in its splendor shall fall .
