b ' a Despairing Lament   a song ; a psalm of the Korahites . for the leader ; accord to   Mahalath . for singing ; a   maskil   of Heman the Ezrahite .    I   Lord , the God of my salvation , I call out by day ;   at night I cry aloud in your presence .    let my prayer come before you ;   incline your ear to my cry .     for my soul be fill with trouble ;    my life draw near to Sheol .   I be reckon with those who go down to the pit ;   I be like a warrior without strength .   my couch be among the dead ,   like the slain who lie in the grave . you remember they no more ;   they be cut off from your influence .   you plunge I into the bottom of the pit ,   into the darkness of the abyss .   your wrath lie heavy upon I ;   all your wave crash over I .   Selah    II   because of you my acquaintance shun I ;   you make I loathsome to they ;   cage in , I can not escape ;    my eye grow dim from trouble .    all day I call on you ,   Lord ;   I stretch out my hand to you .    do you work wonder for the dead ?   do the shade arise and praise you ?   Selah    III   be your mercy proclaim in the grave ,   your faithfulness among those who have perish ?    be your marvel declare in the darkness ,   your righteous deed in the land of oblivion ?    IV   but I cry out to you ,   Lord ;   in the morning my prayer come before you .   why do you reject my soul ,   Lord ,   and hide your face from I ?   I have be mortally afflict since youth ;   I have bear your terror and I be make numb .   your wrath have sweep over I ;   your terror have destroy I .    all day they surge round like a flood ;   from every side they encircle I .   because of you friend and neighbor shun I ;    my only friend be darkness .
