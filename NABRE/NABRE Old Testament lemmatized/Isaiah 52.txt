b '   let Zion rejoice   Awake , awake !   put on your strength , Zion ; put on your glorious garment ,   Jerusalem , holy city . never again shall the uncircumcised   or the unclean enter you .   Arise , shake off the dust ,   sit enthrone , Jerusalem ; loose the bond from your neck ,   captive daughter Zion !    for thus say the   Lord : for nothing you be sell ,   without money you shall be redeem .      for thus say the Lord   God : to Egypt long ago my people go down ,   to sojourn there ;   Assyria , too , oppress they for nought .   but now , what be I to do here ?   \xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord . my people have be take away for nothing ;   their ruler mock , oracle of the   Lord ;   constantly , every day , my name be revile .   therefore my people shall know my name   on that day , that it be I who speak : here I be !   how beautiful upon the mountain    be the foot of the one bring good news , announce peace , bear good news ,   announce salvation , say to Zion ,   your God be King !      listen ! your sentinel raise a cry ,   together they shout for joy , for they see directly , before their eye ,   the   Lord s return to Zion .    break out together in song ,   o ruin of Jerusalem ! for the   Lord   have comfort his people ,   have redeem Jerusalem .   the   Lord   have bare his holy arm   in the sight of all the nation ; all the end of the earth can see   the salvation of our God .     Depart , depart , go out from there ,   touch nothing unclean ! out from there !    purify yourself ,   you who carry the vessel of the   Lord .   but not in hurried flight will you go out ,   nor leave in headlong haste , for the   Lord   go before you ,   and your rear guard be the God of Israel .     suffer and Triumph of the Servant of the Lord    see , my servant shall prosper ,   he shall be raise high and greatly exalted .   even as many be amazed at him\xe2\x80\x94   so mar be his feature ,   beyond that of mortal   his appearance , beyond that of human beings\xe2\x80\x94    so shall he startle many nation ,   king shall stand speechless ; for those who have not be tell shall see ,   those who have not hear shall ponder it .
