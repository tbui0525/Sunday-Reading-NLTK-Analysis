b '   the Faithful Rechabites .     the word that come to Jeremiah from the   Lord   in the day of Jehoiakim ,    son of Josiah , king of Judah :      go to the house    of the rechabite , speak to they , and bring they to the house of the   Lord , to one of the room there , and give they wine to drink .      so I take Jaazaniah , son of Jeremiah , son of Habazziniah , his brother and all his sons\xe2\x80\x94the whole house of the Rechabites\xe2\x80\x94      and I bring they to the house of the   Lord , to the room of the son of Hanan ,    son of Igdaliah , the man of God , next to the room of the prince above the room of Maaseiah , son of Shallum , the guard at the entrance .      I set before the Rechabites bowl full of wine , and cup , and say to they , drink some wine .     we do not drink wine , they say to I ; Jonadab ,    Rechabs son , our father , command we , neither you nor your child shall ever drink wine .        build no house and sow no seed ; do not plant vineyard or own any . you must dwell in tent all your life , so that you may live long on the land where you live as resident alien .      we have obey Jonadab , Rechabs son , our father , in everything that he command we : not drink wine as long as we live\xe2\x80\x94neither we nor our wife nor our son nor our daughter ;      not build house to live in ; not own vineyard or field or crop .      we live in tent , do everything our father Jonadab command we .      but when Nebuchadnezzar , king of Babylon , invade this land , we say , come , let we go into Jerusalem to escape the army of the Chaldeans and the army of the Arameans .    that be why we be now live in Jerusalem .      then the word of the   Lord   come to Jeremiah :      thus say the   Lord   of host , the God of Israel : go , say to the people of Judah and to the inhabitant of Jerusalem : will you not take correction and obey my words?\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord .        the word of Jonadab , Rechabs son , by which he command his child not to drink wine , have be uphold : to this day they have not drunk wine ; they obey their ancestor command . I , however , have speak to you time and again . but you do not obey I !        Time and again I send you all my servant the prophet , say : turn away , each of you , from your evil way and reform your action ! do not follow other god to serve they that you may remain in the land which I give you and your ancestor . but you do not pay attention . you do not obey I .        yes , the child of Jonadab , Rechabs son , uphold the command which their father lay on they . but this people have not obey I !      now , therefore , say the   Lord   God of host , the God of Israel : I will soon bring upon Judah and all the inhabitant of Jerusalem every evil with which I threaten they because I speak but they do not obey , I call but they do not answer .      but to the house of the Rechabites Jeremiah say : thus say the   Lord   of host , the God of Israel : since you have obey the command of Jonadab , your father , keep all his command and do everything he command you ,      therefore , thus say the   Lord   of host , the God of Israel : never shall there fail to be a descendant of Jonadab , Rechabs son , stand in my presence .
