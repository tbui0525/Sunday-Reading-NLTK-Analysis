Act with all the wisdom you possess ; do not let his gray head go down to Sheol in peace .       but be true to the son of Barzillai the Gileadite , and have they among those who eat at your table . for they be loyal to I when I be flee from your brother Absalom .       you also have with you Shimei , son of Gera , the Benjaminite of Bahurim , who curse I bitterly the day I be go to Mahanaim . when he come down to meet I at the Jordan , I swear to he by the   Lord : I will not kill you by the sword .      but you must not let he go unpunished . you be wise ; you will know what to do to send his gray head down to Sheol in blood .      David rest with his ancestor and be bury in the City of David .       David be king over Israel for forty year : he be king seven year in Hebron and thirty - three year in Jerusalem . the Kingdom make Secure .        then Solomon sit on the throne of David his father , and his kingship be establish .     Adonijah , son of Haggith , come to Bathsheba , the mother of Solomon . do you come in peace ? she ask . in peace , he answer ,      and he add , I have something to say to you . she reply , speak .      so he say : you know that the kingship be mine , and all Israel expect I to be king . but the kingship pass I by and go to my brother ; by the   Lord s will it go to he .      but now there be one favor I would ask of you . do not refuse I . and she say , speak on .       he say , please ask King Solomon , who will not refuse you , to give I Abishag the Shunamite to be my wife .      Bathsheba reply , very well , I will speak to the king for you .     then Bathsheba go to King Solomon to speak to he for Adonijah , and the king stand up to meet she and pay her homage . then he sit down upon his throne , and a throne be provide for the king mother , who sit at his right .      she say , there be one small favor I would ask of you . do not refuse I . the king say to she , ask it , my mother , for I will not refuse you .      so she say , let Abishag the Shunamite be give to your brother Adonijah to be his wife .      King Solomon answer his mother , and why do you ask that Abishag the Shunamite be give to Adonijah ? ask the kingship for he as well , for he be my old brother ! ask for he , for Abiathar the priest , for Joab , son of Zeruiah !      and King Solomon swear by the   Lord : may God do thus to I and more , if Adonijah have not speak this word at the cost of his life .       and now , as the   Lord   live , who have establish I and set I on the throne of David my father and make for I a house as he promise , this day shall Adonijah be put to death .      then King Solomon send Benaiah , son of Jehoiada , who strike he dead .      the king say to Abiathar the priest : go to your estate in Anathoth . though you deserve to die , I will not put you to death at this time , because you carry the ark of the Lord   God   before David my father and share in all the hardship my father endure .         so Solomon dismiss Abiathar from the office of priest of the   Lord , thus fulfil the word the   Lord   have speak in Shiloh against the house of Eli .     when the news come to Joab , since he have side with Adonijah , though not with Absalom , he flee to the tent of the   Lord   and clung to the horn of the altar .      King Solomon be tell , Joab have flee to the tent of the   Lord   and be by the altar . he send Benaiah , son of Jehoiada , with the order , go , strike he down .      Benaiah go to the tent of the   Lord   and say to he , the king say , come out . but he answer , no ! I will die here . Benaiah report to the king , this be what Joab say to I in reply .      the king answer he : do as he have say . strike he down and bury he , and remove from I and from my father house the blood which Joab shed without provocation .       the   Lord   will bring blood upon his own head , because he strike down two man well and more just than himself , and slew they with the sword without my father Davids knowledge : Abner , son of Ner , commander of Israels army , and Amasa , son of Jether , commander of Judahs army .      their blood will be upon the head of Joab and his descendant . but upon David and his descendant , upon his house and his throne , there shall be peace forever from the   Lord .      Benaiah , son of Jehoiada , go back , strike he down and kill he ; he be bury in his house in the wilderness .      the king appoint Benaiah , son of Jehoiada , over the army in his place ; Zadok the priest the king put in place of Abiathar .     then the king summon Shimei and say to he : build yourself a house in Jerusalem and stay there . do not go anywhere else .      for the day you leave , and cross the Wadi Kidron , be certain you shall surely die . your blood shall be upon your own head .      Shimei answer the king : I accept . your servant will do just as my lord the king have say . so Shimei stay in Jerusalem for a long time .      but three year later , two of Shimeis servant run away to Achish , son of Maacah , king of Gath , and Shimei be tell , your servant be in Gath .      so Shimei rise , saddle his donkey , and go to Achish in Gath in search of his servant ; and Shimei return from Gath with his servant .      when Solomon be tell that Shimei have go from Jerusalem to Gath , and have return ,      the king summon Shimei and say to he : do I not have you swear by the   Lord   and warn you clearly , the day you leave and go anywhere else , be certain you shall surely die ? and you answer , I accept and obey .        why , then , have you not keep the oath of the   Lord   and the command that I give you ?       and the king say to Shimei : in your heart you know very well the evil that you do to David my father . now the   Lord   be bring your own evil upon your head .      but King Solomon shall be bless , and Davids throne shall be establish before the   Lord   forever .      the king then give the order to Benaiah , son of Jehoiada , who go out and strike he dead . and the royal power be establish in Solomons hand .
