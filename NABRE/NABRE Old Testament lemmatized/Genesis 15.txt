b '   the Covenant with Abram .      some time afterward , the word of the   Lord   come to Abram in a vision : do not fear , Abram ! I be your shield ; I will make your reward very great .     but Abram say , Lord   God , what can you give I , if I die childless and have only a servant of my household , Eliezer of Damascus ?      Abram continue , look , you have give I no offspring , so a servant of my household will be my heir .      then the word of the   Lord   come to he : no , that one will not be your heir ; your own offspring will be your heir .        he take he outside and say : look up at the sky and count the star , if you can . just so , he add , will your descendant be .         Abram put his faith in the   Lord , who attribute it to he as an act of righteousness .      he then say to he : I be the   Lord   who bring you from Ur of the Chaldeans to give you this land as a possession .        Lord   God , he ask , how will I know that I will possess it ?       he answer he : bring I a three - year - old heifer , a three - year - old female goat , a three - year - old ram , a turtledove , and a young pigeon .        he bring he all these , split they in two , and place each half opposite the other ; but the bird he do not cut up .      bird of prey swoop down on the carcass , but Abram scare they away .      as the sun be about to set , a deep sleep fall upon Abram , and a great , dark dread descend upon he .      then the   Lord   say to Abram : know for certain that your descendant will reside as alien in a land not their own , where they shall be enslave and oppress for four hundred year .        but I will bring judgment on the nation they must serve , and after this they will go out with great wealth .        you , however , will go to your ancestor in peace ; you will be bury at a ripe old age .      in the fourth generation    your descendant will return here , for the wickedness of the Amorites be not yet complete .      when the sun have set and it be dark , there appear a smoking fire pot and a flame torch , which pass between those piece .       on that day the   Lord   make a covenant with Abram , say : to your descendant I give this land , from the Wadi of Egypt to the Great River , the Euphrates ,         the land of the Kenites , the Kenizzites , the Kadmonites ,      the Hittites , the Perizzites , the Rephaim ,      the Amorites , the Canaanites , the Girgashites , and the Jebusites .
