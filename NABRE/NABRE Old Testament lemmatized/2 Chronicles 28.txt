b '   Ahazs Misdeeds .      Ahaz be twenty year old when he become king , and he reign sixteen year in Jerusalem . he do not do what be right in the sight of the   Lord   as David his father have do .      he walk in the way of the king of Israel and even make molten idol for the Baals .      moreover , he offer sacrifice in the Valley of Ben - hinnom , and immolate his child by fire in accordance with the abominable practice of the nation whom the   Lord   have dispossess before the Israelites .        he sacrifice and burn incense on the high place , on hill , and under every green tree .    Ahaz punish .      therefore the   Lord , his God , deliver he into the power of the king of Aram . the Arameans defeat he and carry away captive a large number of his people , whom they bring to Damascus . he be also deliver into the power of the king of Israel , who defeat he with great slaughter .        for Pekah , son of Remaliah , kill one hundred and twenty thousand of Judah in a single day , all of they valiant man , because they have abandon the   Lord , the God of their ancestor .      Zichri , an Ephraimite warrior , kill Maaseiah , the king son , and Azrikam , the master of the palace , and also Elkanah , who be second to the king .      the Israelites take away as captive two hundred thousand of their kinfolks wife , son , and daughter ; they also take from they much plunder , which they bring to Samaria .    Odeds Prophecy .     in Samaria there be a prophet of the   Lord   by the name of Oded . he go out to meet the army return to Samaria and say to they : it be because the   Lord , the God of your ancestor , be angry with Judah that he deliver they into your power . you , however , have kill they with a fury that have reach up to heaven .      and now you be plan to subjugate the people of Judah and Jerusalem as your slave and bondwomen . be not you yourself , therefore , guilty of a crime against the   Lord , your God ?      now listen to I : send back the captive you have carry off from among your kin , for the burn anger of the   Lord   be upon you .     at this , some of the Ephraimite leader , Azariah , son of Johanan , Berechiah , son of Meshillemoth , Jehizkiah , son of Shallum , and Amasa , son of Hadlai , themselves stand up in opposition to those who have return from the war .      they say to they : do not bring the captive here , for what you be plan will make we guilty before the   Lord   and increase our sin and our guilt . great be our guilt , and there be burn anger upon Israel .      therefore the soldier leave their captive and the plunder before the prince and the whole assembly .      then the man just name proceed to help the captive . all of they who be naked they clothe from the spoil ; they clothe they , put sandal on their foot , give they food and drink , anoint they , and all who be weak they set on donkey . they bring they to Jericho , the City of Palms , to their kinfolk . then they return to Samaria .     further Sins of Ahaz .     at that time King Ahaz send an appeal for help to the king of Assyria .        the Edomites have return , attack Judah , and carry off captive .        the Philistines too have raid the city of the Shephelah and the Negeb of Judah ; they capture Beth - shemesh , Aijalon , Gederoth , Soco and its dependency , Timnah and its dependency , and Gimzo and its dependency , and settle there .      for the   Lord   have bring Judah low because of Ahaz , king of Israel ,    who let Judah go its own way and commit treachery against the   Lord .      Tiglath - pilneser , king of Assyria , do indeed come to he , but to oppress he rather than to lend strength .        though Ahaz plunder the   Lord s house and the house of the king and the prince to pay off the king of Assyria , it be no help to he .      while he be already in distress , the same King Ahaz increase his treachery to the   Lord .      he sacrifice to the god of Damascus who have defeat he , say , since it be the god of the king of Aram who help they , I will sacrifice to they that they may help I also . however , they only further his downfall and that of all Israel .        Ahaz gather up the utensil of Gods house and break they in piece . he close the door of the   Lord s house and make altar for himself in every corner of Jerusalem .        in every city throughout Judah he set up high place to offer sacrifice to other god . thus he provoke the   Lord , the God of his ancestor , to anger .      the rest of his word and his deed , first and last , be record in the book of the king of Judah and Israel .      Ahaz rest with his ancestor and be bury in Jerusalem\xe2\x80\x94 in the city , for they do not bring he to the tomb of the king of Israel . his son Hezekiah succeed he as king .             '
