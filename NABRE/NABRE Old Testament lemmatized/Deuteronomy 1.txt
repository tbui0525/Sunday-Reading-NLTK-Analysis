b '    Introduction .      these be the word that Moses speak to all Israel beyond the Jordan in the wilderness , in the Arabah , opposite Suph , between Paran and Tophel , Laban , Hazeroth , and Dizahab .      it be a journey of eleven day from Horeb    to Kadesh - barnea by way of the highland of Seir .     in the fortieth year ,    on the first day of the eleventh month , Moses speak to the Israelites accord to all that the   Lord   have command he to speak to they ,      after he have defeat Sihon , king of the Amorites , who reign in Heshbon ,    and Og , king of Bashan , who reign in Ashtaroth and in Edrei .      beyond the Jordan , in the land of Moab , Moses undertake to explain this law :    departure from Horeb .       the   Lord , our God , say to we at Horeb :    you have stay long enough at this mountain .      leave here and go to the hill country of the Amorites    and to all the surround region , the Arabah , the mountain , the Shephelah , the Negeb and the seacoast\xe2\x80\x94the land of the Canaanites and the Lebanon as far as the Great River , the Euphrates .      see , I have give that land over to you .    go now and possess the land that the   Lord   swear to your ancestor , Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob , to give to they and to their descendant after they .    Appointment of Elders .      at that time I say to you , I be unable to carry you by myself .        the   Lord , your God , have make you numerous , and now you be as numerous as the star of the heaven .        may the   Lord , the God of your ancestor , increase you a thousand time over , and bless you as he promise !      but how can I , by myself , bear the weight , the contentiousness of you ?      provide wise , discerning , and reputable person for each of your tribe , that I may appoint they as your leader .      you answer I , what you have propose be good .      so I take the leader of your tribe , wise and reputable , and set they as leader over you , commander over thousand , over hundred , over fifty and over ten , and other tribal officer .       I charge your judge at that time , listen to complaint among your relative , and administer true justice to both party even if one of they be a resident alien .      in render judgment , do not consider who a person be ; give ear to the lowly and to the great alike , fear no one , for the judgment be god . any case that be too difficult for you bring to I and I will hear it .      thus I charge you , at that time , with all the thing you be to do .    the Twelve Scouts .      then we set out from Horeb and journey through that whole vast and fearful wilderness that you have see , in the direction of the hill country of the Amorites , as the   Lord , our God , have command ; and we come to Kadesh - barnea .        I say to you , you have come to the hill country of the Amorites , which the   Lord , our God , be give we .      see , the   Lord , your God , have give this land over to you . go up and take possession of it , as the   Lord , the God of your ancestor , have promise you . do not fear or be dismay .      then all of you approach I and say , let we send man ahead to spy out the land for we and report to we on the road we should follow and the city we will come upon .      agree with the proposal , I take twelve man from your number , one from each tribe .      they set out into the hill country as far as the Wadi Eshcol , and explore it .      then , take along some of the fruit of the land , they bring it down to we and report , the land the   Lord , our God , be give we be good .    threat of Revolt .      but you refuse to go up ;    you defy the command of the   Lord , your God .      you set to murmur in your tent , out of hatred for we the   Lord   have bring we out of the land of Egypt ,    to deliver we into the power of the Amorites and destroy we .      what shall we meet with up there ? our man have make our heart melt by say , the people be big and tall than we , and their city be large and fortified to the sky ; besides , we see the Anakim    there .      but I say to you , have no dread or fear of they .       the   Lord , your God , who go before you , be the one who will fight for you , just as he act with you before your very eye in Egypt ,      as well as in the wilderness , where you see how the   Lord , your God , carry you , as one carry his own child , all along your journey until you arrive at this place .      despite this , you would not trust the   Lord , your God ,      who journey before you to find you a place to camp\xe2\x80\x94by night in the fire , and by day in the cloud , to show you the way to go .        when the   Lord   hear your word , he be angry , and take an oath :      not a single one of this evil generation shall look upon the good land I swear to give to your ancestor ,      except Caleb ,    son of Jephunneh . he shall see it , for to he and to his descendant I will give the land he trod upon ,    because he have fully follow the   Lord .     the   Lord   be anger against I also on your account , and say , you shall not enter there either ,        but Joshua ,    son of Nun , your attendant , shall enter . encourage he , for he be the one who be to give Israel its possession .      your little one , who you say would become plunder , and your child , who as yet do not know good from evil\xe2\x80\x94they shall enter there ; to they I will give it , and they shall take possession of it .      but as for yourself : turn back and proceed into the wilderness on the Red Sea road .    Unsuccessful Invasion .      in reply you say to I , we have sin against the   Lord . we will go up ourselves and fight , just as the   Lord , our God , command we . and each of you gird on his weapon , make light of go up into the hill country .      but the   Lord   say to I , warn they : do not go up and fight\xe2\x80\x94for I will not be in your midst\xe2\x80\x94lest you be beat down before your enemy .      I give you this warning but you would not listen . you defy the   Lord s command and arrogantly go off into the hill country .      then the Amorites live in that hill country come out against you and put you to flight the way bee do , cut you down in Seir as far as Hormah .      on your return you weep before the   Lord , but the   Lord   do not listen to your voice or give ear to you .      that be why you have to stay as long as you do at Kadesh .
