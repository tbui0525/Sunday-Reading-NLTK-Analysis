b '    do not boast about tomorrow ,   for you do not know what any day may bring forth .   let another praise you , not your own mouth ;   a stranger , not your own lip .   Stone be heavy , and sand a burden ,   but a fool provocation be heavy than both .    Anger be cruel , and wrath overwhelming ,   but before jealousy who can stand ?     well be an open rebuke   than a love that remain hidden .   Trustworthy be the blow of a friend ,   dangerous , the kiss of an enemy .    one who be full spurn honey ;   but to the hungry , any bitter thing be sweet .   like a bird far from the nest   so be anyone far from home .    perfume and incense bring joy to the heart ,   but by grief the soul be tear asunder .   do not give up your own friend and your father friend ;   do not resort to the house of your kindred when trouble strike . well a neighbor near than kin far away .    be wise , my son , and bring joy to my heart ,   so that I can answer whoever taunt I .    the astute see an evil and hide ;   the naive continue on and pay the penalty .    take the garment of the one who become surety for a stranger ;    if for a foreign woman , exact the pledge !    those who greet their neighbor with a loud voice    in the early morning ,   a curse can be lay to their charge .   for a persistent leak on a rainy day   the match be a quarrelsome wife ;    whoever would hide she hide a stormwind   and can not tell north from south .   Iron be sharpen by iron ;   one person sharpen another .    those who tend a fig tree eat its fruit ;   so those attentive to their master will be honor .   as face mirror face in water ,   so the heart reflect the person .   Sheol and Abaddon can never be satisfied ;    so the eye of mortal can never be satisfied .    the crucible for silver , the furnace for gold ,   so you must assay the praise you receive .   though you pound fool with a pestle ,   their folly never leave they .    take good care of your flock ,   give careful attention to your herd ;   for wealth do not last forever ,   nor even a crown from age to age .   when the grass come up and the new growth appear ,   and the mountain green be gather in ,   the lamb will provide you with clothing ,   and the goat , the price of a field ,   and there will be ample goat milk for your food ,   food for your house , sustenance for your maiden .
