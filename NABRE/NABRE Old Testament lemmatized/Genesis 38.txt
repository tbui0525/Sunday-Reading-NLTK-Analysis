b '   Judah and Tamar .      about that time Judah go down , away from his brother , and pitch his tent near a certain Adullamite name Hirah .      there Judah see the daughter of a Canaanite name Shua ; he marry she , and have intercourse with she .        she conceive and bear a son , whom she name Er .      again she conceive and bear a son , whom she name Onan .      then she bear still another son , whom she name Shelah . she be in Chezib    when she bear he .      Judah get a wife name Tamar for his firstborn , er .      but er , Judahs firstborn , greatly offend the   Lord ; so the   Lord   take his life .         then Judah say to Onan , have intercourse with your brother wife , in fulfillment of your duty as brother - in - law , and thus preserve your brother line .        Onan , however , know that the offspring would not be his ; so whenever he have intercourse with his brother wife , he waste his seed on the ground , to avoid give offspring to his brother .      what he do greatly offend the   Lord , and the   Lord   take his life too .      then Judah say to his daughter - in - law Tamar , remain a widow in your father house until my son Shelah grow up\xe2\x80\x94for he fear that Shelah also might die like his brother . so Tamar go to live in her father house .     Time pass , and the daughter of Shua , Judahs wife , die . after Judah complete the period of mourning , he go up to Timnah , to those who be shear his sheep , in company with his friend Hirah the Adullamite .      then Tamar be tell , your father - in - law be on his way up to Timnah to shear his sheep .      so she take off her widow garment , cover herself with a shawl , and having wrap herself sit down at the entrance to Enaim , which be on the way to Timnah ; for she be aware that , although Shelah be now grow up , she have not be give to he in marriage .        when Judah see she , he think she be a harlot , since she have cover her face .      so he go over to she at the roadside and say , come , let I have intercourse with you , for he do not realize that she be his daughter - in - law . she reply , what will you pay I for let you have intercourse with I ?      he answer , I will send you a young goat from the flock . very well , she say , provide you leave I a pledge until you send it .      Judah ask , what pledge should I leave you ? she answer , your seal and cord ,    and the staff in your hand . so he give they to she and have intercourse with she , and she conceive by he .      after she get up and go away , she take off her shawl and put on her widow garment again .     Judah send the young goat by his friend the Adullamite to recover the pledge from the woman ; but he do not find she .      so he ask the man of that place , where be the prostitute ,    the one by the roadside in Enaim ? but they answer , no prostitute have be here .      he go back to Judah and tell he , I do not find she ; and besides , the man of the place say , no prostitute have be here .      let she keep the thing , Judah reply ; otherwise we will become a laughingstock . after all , I do send she this young goat , but you do not find she .     about three month later , Judah be tell , your daughter - in - law Tamar have act like a harlot and now she be pregnant from her harlotry . Judah say , bring she out ; let she be burn .      but as she be be bring out , she send word to her father - in - law , it be by the man to whom these thing belong that I be pregnant . then she say , see whose seal and cord and staff these be .      Judah recognize they and say , she be in the right rather than I , since I do not give she to my son Shelah . he have no further sexual relation with she .     when the time of her delivery come , there be twin in her womb .        while she be give birth , one put out his hand ; and the midwife take and tie a crimson thread on his hand , note , this one come out first .       but as he withdraw his hand , his brother come out ; and she say , what a breach you have make for yourself ! so he be call Perez .        afterward his brother , who have the crimson thread on his hand , come out ; he be call Zerah .
