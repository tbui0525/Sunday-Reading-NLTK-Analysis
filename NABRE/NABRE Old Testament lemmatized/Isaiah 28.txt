b ' E. the Lord Alone , Israels and Judahs Salvation chapter 28 the Fate of Samaria    Ah ! majestic garland   of the drunkard of Ephraim ,   fade bloom of his glorious beauty ,   at the head of the fertile valley ,   upon those stupefy with wine .    see , the   Lord   have a strong one , a mighty one ,    who , like an onslaught of hail , a destructive storm , like a flood of water , great and overflowing ,   level to the ground with violence ;    with foot that will trample   the majestic garland of the drunkard of Ephraim .   the fade bloom of his glorious beauty   at the head of the fertile valley will be like an early fig before summer :   whoever see it ,   swallow it as soon as it be in hand .    on that day the   Lord   of host   will be a glorious crown and a brilliant diadem   for the remnant of his people ,   a spirit of judgment   for the one who sit in judgment , and strength for those   who turn back the battle at the gate .    against Judah   but these also stagger from wine   and stumble from strong drink : Priest and prophet stagger from strong drink ,   overpower by wine ; they be confuse by strong drink ,   they stagger in their vision ,   they totter when give judgment .    yes , all the table   be cover with vomit ,   with filth , and no place leave clean .    to whom would he impart knowledge ? to whom would he convey the message ? to those just wean from milk ,   those wean from the breast ?   for he say , Command on command , command on command ,   rule on rule , rule on rule ,   here a little , there a little !    yes , with stammer lip and in a strange language   he will speak to this people ,     to whom he say : this be the rest place ,   give rest to the weary ; and this be the place of repose\xe2\x80\x94   but they refuse to hear .    so for they the word of the   Lord   shall be :   Command on command , command on command , rule on rule , rule on rule ,   here a little , there a little ! so that when they walk , they shall stumble backward ,   break , ensnare , and capture .    therefore , hear the word of the   Lord , you scoffer ,   who rule    this people in Jerusalem :    you have declare , we have make a covenant with death ,   with Sheol    we have make a pact ; when the rage flood pass through ,   it will not reach we ; for we have make lie our refuge ,   and in falsehood we have find a hiding place,\xe2\x80\x94    therefore , thus say the Lord   God :   see , I be lay a stone in Zion ,    a stone that have be test , a precious cornerstone as a sure foundation ;   whoever put faith in it will not waver .    I will make judgment a measure line ,   and justice a level.\xe2\x80\x94   Hail shall sweep away the refuge of lie ,   and water shall flood the hiding place .   your covenant with death shall be cancel   and your pact with Sheol shall not stand . when the rage flood pass through ,   you shall be beat down by it .    whenever it pass , it shall seize you ;   morning after morning it shall pass ,   by day and by night . sheer terror   to impart the message !   for the bed shall be too short to stretch out in ,   and the cover too narrow to wrap in .   for the   Lord   shall rise up as on Mount Perazim ,   bestir himself as in the Valley of Gibeon ,   to carry out his work\xe2\x80\x94strange his work !   to perform his deed\xe2\x80\x94alien his deed !   now , cease scoffing ,   lest your bond be tighten , for I have hear a decree of destruction   from the Lord , the   God   of host ,   for the whole land .     the parable of the Farmer    give ear and hear my voice ,   pay attention and hear my word :   be the plowman forever plow in order to sow ,   always loosen and harrowing the field ?   when he have level the surface ,   do he not scatter caraway and sow cumin ,   put in wheat and barley ,   with spelt as its border ?   his God have teach he this rule ,   he have instruct he .   for caraway be not thresh with a sledge ,   nor do a cartwheel roll over cumin . but caraway be beat out with a staff ,   and cumin with a rod .   grain be crush for bread , but not forever ;   though he thresh it thoroughly ,   and drive his cartwheel and horse over it ,   he do not pulverize it .   this too come from the   Lord   of host ;   wonderful be his counsel and great his wisdom .
