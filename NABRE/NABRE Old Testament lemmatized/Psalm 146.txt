b ' trust in God the Creator and Redeemer   Hallelujah !     praise the   Lord , my soul ;   I will praise the   Lord   all my life ,   sing praise to my God while I live .     I   put no trust in prince ,   in child of Adam powerless to save .     who breathe his last , return to the earth ;   that day all his planning come to nothing .     II   bless the one whose help be the God of Jacob ,   whose hope be in the   Lord , his God ,   the maker of heaven and earth ,   the sea and all that be in they ,   who keep faith forever ,    secure justice for the oppressed ,    who give bread to the hungry . the   Lord   set prisoner free ;     the   Lord   give sight to the blind . the   Lord   raise up those who be bow down ;    the   Lord   love the righteous .   the   Lord   protect the resident alien ,   come to the aid of the orphan and the widow ,    but thwart the way of the wicked .   the   Lord   shall reign forever ,   your God , Zion , through all generation !   Hallelujah !             '
