b '   Restoration of Israel .     but the   Lord   will take pity on Jacob and again choose Israel , and will settle they on their own land ; foreigner will join they and attach themselves to the house of Jacob .        the nation will take they and bring they to their place , and the house of Israel will possess they    as male and female slave on the Lords land ; they will take captive their captor and rule over their oppressor .     Downfall of the King of Babylon .     on the day when the   Lord   give you rest from your sorrow and turmoil , from the hard service with which you serve ,        you will take up this taunt - song    against the king of Babylon :   how the oppressor have come to an end !   how the turmoil have end !   the   Lord   have break the rod of the wicked ,   the staff of the tyrant    that strike the people in wrath   with relentless blow ; that rule the nation in anger ,   with boundless persecution .    the whole earth rest peacefully ,   song break forth ;   the very cypress rejoice over you ,   the cedar of Lebanon : now that you be lay to rest ,   no one come to cut we down .    below , Sheol be all astir   prepare for your coming ; awaken the shade to greet you ,   all the leader of the earth ; make all the king of the nation   rise from their throne .   all of they speak out   and say to you , you too have become weak like we ,   you be just like we !   down to sheol your pomp be bring ,   the sound of your harp . maggot be the couch beneath you ,   worm your blanket .    how you have fall from the heavens ,   O Morning Star ,    son of the dawn ! how you have be cut down to the earth ,   you who conquer nation !    in your heart you say :   I will scale the heavens ; above the star of God    I will set up my throne ; I will take my seat on the Mount of Assembly ,   on the height of Zaphon .    I will ascend above the top of the cloud ;   I will be like the most high !    no ! down to Sheol you will be bring   to the depth of the pit !    when they see you they will stare ,   ponder over you : be this the man who make the earth tremble ,   who shake kingdom ?   who make the world a wilderness ,   raze its city ,   and give captive no release ?   all the king of the nation lie in glory ,   each in his own tomb ;    but you be cast forth without burial ,   like loathsome carrion , cover with the slain , with those strike by the sword ,   a trample corpse , go down to the very stone of the pit .     you will never be together with they in the grave , for you have ruin your land ,   you have slay your people ! let he never be name ,   that offshoot of evil !   make ready to slaughter his son   for the guilt of their father ;   lest they rise and possess the earth ,   and fill the breadth of the world with city .      I will rise up against they , say the   Lord   of host , and cut off from Babylon name and remnant , progeny and offspring , say the   Lord .        I will make it a haunt of hoot owl and a marshland ; I will sweep it with the broom of destruction , oracle of the   Lord   of host .    Gods Plan for Assyria     the   Lord   of host have swear : as I have resolve ,   so shall it be ; as I have plan ,   so shall it stand :   to break the Assyrian in my land   and trample he on my mountain ; then his yoke shall be remove from they ,   and his burden from their shoulder .    this be the plan propose for the whole earth ,   and this the hand outstretche over all the nation .    the   Lord   of host have plan ;   who can thwart he ? his hand be stretch out ;   who can turn it back ?   Philistia .        in the year that King Ahaz die ,    there come this oracle :      do not rejoice , Philistia , not one of you ,   that the rod which strike you be break ; for out of the serpent root shall come an adder ,   its offspring shall be a flying saraph .   in my pasture the poor shall graze ,   and the needy lie down in safety ; but I will kill your root with famine   that shall slay even your remnant .   Howl , O gate ; cry out , o city !   Philistia , all of you melt away ! for there come a smoke from the north ,    without a straggler in its rank .   what will one answer the messenger of the nation ?    the   Lord   have establish Zion ,   and in she the afflicted of his people find refuge .
