b '   Consecration of Firstborn .     the   Lord   speak to Moses and say :      consecrate to I every firstborn ; whatever open the womb among the Israelites ,    whether of human being or beast , belong to I .      Moses say to the people , remember this day on which you come out of Egypt , out of a house of slavery . for it be with a strong hand that the   Lord   bring you out from there . nothing make with leaven may be eat .      this day on which you be go out be in the month of Abib .        therefore , when the   Lord , your God , have bring you into the land of the Canaanites , the Hittites , the Amorites , the Perrizites , the Girgashites , the Hivites , and the Jebusites , which he swear to your ancestor to give you , a land flow with milk and honey , you will perform the follow service    in this month .      for seven day you will eat unleavened bread , and the seventh day will also be a festival to the   Lord .      unleavened bread may be eat during the seven day , but nothing leaven and no leaven may be find in your possession in all your territory .      and on that day you will explain to your son , this be because of what the   Lord   do for I when I come out of Egypt .      it will be like a sign    on your hand and a reminder on your forehead ,    so that the teaching of the   Lord   will be on your lip : with a strong hand the   Lord   bring you out of Egypt .      you will keep this statute at its appoint time from year to year .     when the   Lord , your God , have bring you into the land of the Canaanites , just as he swear to you and your ancestor , and give it to you ,       you will dedicate to the   Lord   every newborn that open the womb ; and every firstborn male of your animal will belong to the   Lord .      every firstborn of a donkey you will ransom with a sheep . if you do not ransom it , you will break its neck . every human firstborn of your son you must ransom .      and when your son ask you later on , what do this mean ? you will tell he , with a strong hand the   Lord   bring we out of Egypt , out of a house of slavery .      when Pharaoh stubbornly refuse to let we go , the   Lord   kill every firstborn in the land of Egypt , the firstborn of human being and beast alike . that be why I sacrifice to the   Lord   every male that open the womb , and why I ransom every firstborn of my son .      it will be like a sign on your hand and a band on your forehead that with a strong hand the   Lord   bring we out of Egypt .      toward the Red Sea .     now , when Pharaoh let the people go , God do not lead they by way of the Philistines land ,    though this be the near ; for God say : if the people see that they have to fight , they might change their mind and return to Egypt .      instead , God reroute they toward the Red Sea by way of the wilderness road , and the Israelites go up out of the land of Egypt array for battle .      Moses also take Josephs bone    with he , for Joseph have make the Israelites take a solemn oath , say , God will surely take care of you , and you must bring my bone up with you from here .     set out from Succoth , they camp at Etham    near the edge of the wilderness .      the   Lord   precede they , in the daytime by mean of a column of cloud to show they the way , and at night by mean of a column of fire    to give they light . thus they could travel both day and night .      neither the column of cloud by day nor the column of fire by night ever leave its place in front of the people .
