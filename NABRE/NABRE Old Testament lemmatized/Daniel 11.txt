b '   the Hellenistic Age .     now I shall tell you the truth . three king of Persia    be yet to appear ; and a fourth shall acquire the great rich of all . strengthen by his rich , he shall stir up all kingdom , even that of Greece .      but a powerful king    shall appear and rule with great might , do as he will .      no soon shall he appear than his kingdom shall be break and divide in four direction under heaven ; but not among his descendant or in keep with his mighty rule , for his kingdom shall be tear to piece and belong to other .      the king of the south shall grow strong , but one of his prince shall grow strong still and govern a domain great than his .       after some year they shall become ally : the daughter of the king of the south shall come to the king of the north to carry out the alliance . but she shall not retain power : and his offspring shall not survive , and she shall be give up , together with those who bring she , her son , and her supporter in due time .      a descendant of her line shall succeed to his place , and shall come against the army , enter the stronghold of the king of the north , attack and conquer they .      even their god , with their molten image and their precious vessel of silver and gold , he shall carry away as spoil of war into Egypt . for year he shall have nothing to do with the king of the north .      then the latter shall invade the land of the king of the south , and return to his own country .     but his son shall be arouse and assemble a great armed host , which shall pass through like a flood and again surge around the stronghold .       the king of the south , enrage , shall go out to fight against the king of the north , who shall field a great host , but the host shall be give into his hand .      when the host be carry off , in the pride of his heart he shall bring down ten of thousand , but he shall not triumph .       for the king of the north shall raise another army , great than before ; after some year he shall attack with this large army and great resource .      in those time many shall resist the king of the south , and violent one among your people shall rise up in fulfillment of vision , but they shall stumble .       when the king of the north come , he shall set up siegework and take the fortify city by storm . the force of the south shall not withstand he , and not even his pick troop shall have the strength to withstand .      the invader shall do as he will , with no one to withstand he . he shall stop in the glorious land , and it shall all be in his power .       he shall resolve to come with the entire strength of his kingdom . he shall make an alliance with he and give he a daughter in marriage in order to destroy he , but this shall not stand .       he shall turn to the coastland and take many prisoner , but a commander shall put an end to his shameful conduct , so that he can not retaliate .      he shall turn to the stronghold of his own land , but shall stumble and fall , to be find no more .       in his stead one shall arise who will send a collector of tribute through the glorious kingdom , but he shall soon be destroy , though not in conflict or in battle .      there shall arise in his place a despicable person , to whom the royal insignia shall not be give . he shall enter by stealth and seize the kingdom by fraud .      armed force shall be completely overwhelmed by he and crush , even the prince of the covenant .        after make alliance , he shall treacherously rise to power with only a few supporter .      by stealth he shall enter prosperous province and do that which his father or grandfather never do ; he shall distribute spoil , plunder , and rich among they and devise plot against their stronghold .      he shall rouse his strength and courage to meet the king of the south with a great army ; the king of the south shall go into battle with a very large and strong army , but he shall not stand because of the plot devise against he .      even his table companion shall seek to destroy he , his army shall be overwhelmed , and many shall be strike down .      the two king , resolve on evil , shall sit at table together and exchange lie , but they shall have no success , because the appoint end be not yet .     he    shall turn back toward his land with great rich , his mind set against the holy covenant ; he shall take action and return to his land .      at the time appoint he shall come again to the south , but this time it shall not be as before .      when ship of the Kittim    confront he , he shall lose heart and retreat . then he shall rage against the holy covenant and take action ; he shall again favor those who forsake the holy covenant .      armed force shall rise at his command and defile the sanctuary stronghold , abolish the daily sacrifice and set up the desolating abomination .      by his deceit he shall make some who be disloyal forsake the covenant ; but those who remain loyal to their God shall take strong action .      those with insight among the people shall instruct the many ; though for a time the sword , flame , exile , and plunder will cause they to stumble .      when they stumble , they will be help ,    but only a little ; many shall join they , but out of treachery .      some of those with insight shall stumble so that they may be test , refine , and purify , until the end time which be still appoint to come .     the king shall do as he will , exalt himself and make himself great than any god ; he shall utter dreadful blasphemy against the God of god . he shall prosper only till the wrath be finish , for what be determined must take place .      he shall have no regard for the god of his ancestor or for the one in whom woman delight ;    for no god shall he have regard , because he shall make himself great than all .      instead , he shall give glory to the god of stronghold ;    a god unknown to his ancestor he shall glorify with gold , silver , precious stone , and other treasure .      he shall act for those who fortify stronghold , a people of a foreign god , whom he have recognize . he shall greatly honor they ; he shall make they rule over the many and distribute the land as a reward .      at the end time the king of the south shall engage he in battle but the king of the north shall overwhelm he with chariot and horseman and a great fleet , pass through the land like a flood .      he shall enter the glorious land and many shall fall , except Edom , Moab , and the chief part of Ammon , which shall escape his power .      he shall extend his power over the land , and not even Egypt shall escape .      he shall control the rich of gold and silver and all the treasure of Egypt ; Libya and Ethiopia shall be in his entourage .      when report from the east and the north disturb he , he shall set out with great fury to destroy many , put they under the ban .      he shall pitch the tent of his royal pavilion between the sea and the glorious holy mountain , but he shall come to his end with none to help he .
