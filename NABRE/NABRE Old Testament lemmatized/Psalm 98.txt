b ' the coming of God   a psalm . I sing a new song to the   Lord ,   for he have do marvelous deed .   his right hand and holy arm   have win the victory .     the   Lord   have make his victory know ;   have reveal his triumph in the sight of the nation ,   he have remember his mercy and faithfulness   toward the house of Israel . all the end of the earth have see   the victory of our God .    II   shout with joy to the   Lord , all the earth ;   break into song ; sing praise .   sing praise to the   Lord   with the lyre ,   with the lyre and melodious song .   with trumpet and the sound of the horn   shout with joy to the King , the   Lord .     III   let the sea and what fill it resound ,    the world and those who dwell there .   let the river clap their hand ,   the mountain shout with they for joy ,     before the   Lord   who come ,   who come to govern the earth ,   to govern the world with justice   and the people with fairness .
