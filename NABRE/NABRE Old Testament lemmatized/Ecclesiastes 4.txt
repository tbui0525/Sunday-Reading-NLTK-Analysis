b '   Vanity of Toil .     again I see all the oppression that take place under the sun : the tear of the victim with none to comfort    they ! from the hand of their oppressor come violence , and there be none to comfort they !        and those now dead , I declare more fortunate in death than be the living to be still alive .        and well off than both be the yet unborn , who have not see the wicked work that be do under the sun .      then I see that all toil and skillful work be the rivalry of one person with another . this also be vanity and a chase after wind .     fool fold their arm   and consume their own flesh\xe2\x80\x94    well be one handful with tranquility   than two with toil and a chase after wind !    companion and successor .     again I see this vanity under the sun :      those all alone with no companion , with neither child nor sibling\xe2\x80\x94with no end to all their toil , and no satisfaction from rich . for whom do I toil and deprive myself of good thing ? this also be vanity and a bad business .      two be well than one : they get a good wage for their toil .      if the one fall , the other will help the fall one . but woe to the solitary person ! if that one should fall , there be no other to help .      so also , if two sleep together , they keep each other warm . how can one alone keep warm ?      where one alone may be overcome , two together can resist . a three - ply cord    be not easily break .      well be a poor but wise youth than an old but foolish king who no long know caution ;      for from a prison house he come forth to reign ; despite his kingship he be bear poor .      I see all the living , those who move about under the sun , with the second youth who will succeed he .        there be no end to all this people , to all who be before they ; yet the later generation will not have joy in he . this also be vanity and a chase after wind .    Vanity of many Words .      guard your step when you go to the house of God .    draw near for obedience , rather than for the fool offering of sacrifice ; for they know not how to keep from do evil .
