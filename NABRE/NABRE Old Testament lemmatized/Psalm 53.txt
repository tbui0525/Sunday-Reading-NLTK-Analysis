b ' A Lament over Widespread Corruption   for the leader ; accord to   Mahalath . a   maskil   of David .    I   the fool say in his heart ,    there be no God .   they act corruptly and practice injustice ;   there be none that do good .   God look out from the heaven   upon the child of Adam ,   to see if there be a discerning person    who be seek God .   all have go astray ;   each one be altogether perverse .   there be not one who do what be good , not even one .     II    do they not know well , those who do evil ,   who feed upon my people as they feed upon bread ?    have they not call upon God ?   they be go to fear his name with great fear ,   though they have not fear it before . for God will scatter the bone   of those encamped against you . they will surely be put to shame ,   for God have reject they .    III   who will bring forth from Zion   the salvation of Israel ? when God reverse the captivity of his people   Jacob will rejoice and Israel will be glad .              '
