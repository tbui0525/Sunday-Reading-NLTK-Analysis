b '    the   Lord   say to Moses :      tell Eleazar , son of Aaron the priest , to remove the censer from the ember ; and scatter the fire some distance away , for they have become holy\xe2\x80\x94       the censer of those who sin at the cost of their life . have they hammer into plate to cover the altar , because in be present before the   Lord   they have become holy . in this way they shall serve as a sign to the Israelites .      so take the bronze censer which have be present by those who be burn , Eleazar the priest have they hammer into a covering for the altar ,      just as the   Lord   have direct he through Moses . this be to be a reminder to the Israelites that no unauthorized person , no one who be not a descendant of Aaron , should draw near to offer incense before the   Lord , lest he meet the fate of Korah and his faction .     the next day the whole israelite community grumble against Moses and Aaron , say , you have kill the people of the   Lord .      but while the community be assemble against they , Moses and Aaron turn toward the tent of meeting , and the cloud now cover it and the glory of the   Lord   appear .      then Moses and Aaron come to the front of the tent of meeting ,      and the   Lord   say to Moses :      remove yourself from this community , that I may consume they at once . but they fall prostrate .     then Moses say to Aaron , take your censer , put fire from the altar in it , lie incense on it , and bring it quickly to the community to make atonement for they ; for wrath have come forth from the   Lord   and the plague have begin .        Aaron take his censer just as Moses direct and run in among the assembly , where the plague have already begin among the people . then he offer the incense and make atonement for the people ,      while stand there between the living and the dead . and so the scourge be check .      there be fourteen thousand seven hundred dead from the scourge , in addition to those who die because of Korah .      when the scourge have be check , Aaron return to Moses at the entrance of the tent of meeting .    Aarons Staff .     the   Lord   now say to Moses :      speak to the Israelites and get from they a staff    for each ancestral house , twelve staff in all , from all the leader of their ancestral house . write each man name on his staff ;      and write Aarons name on Levis staff .    for each head of an ancestral house shall have a staff .      then deposit they in the tent of meeting , in front of the covenant , where I meet you .      the staff of the man whom I choose shall sprout . thus I will rid myself of the Israelites grumble against you .     so Moses speak to the Israelites , and all their leader give he staff , twelve in all , one from each leader of their ancestral house ; and Aarons staff be among they .      then Moses deposit the staff before the   Lord   in the tent of the covenant .      the next day , when Moses enter the tent of the covenant , Aarons staff , represent the house of Levi , have sprout . it have put forth sprout , produce blossom , and bear ripe almond !      so Moses bring out all the staff from the   Lord s presence to all the Israelites , and each one identify his own staff and take it .      then the   Lord   say to Moses : put back Aarons staff in front of the covenant , for safe keeping as a sign to the rebellious , so that their grumble against I may cease and they might not die .      Moses do this . just as the   Lord   have command he , so he do .    Charge of the Sacred Things .      then the Israelites exclaim to Moses , we will perish ; we be lose , we be all lose !      anyone who approach the tabernacle of the   Lord   will die ! will there be no end to our perish ?
