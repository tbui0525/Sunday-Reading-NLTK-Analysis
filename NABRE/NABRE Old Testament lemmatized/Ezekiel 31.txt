b '   Allegory of the Cedar .     on the first day of the third month in the eleventh year ,    the word of the   Lord   come to I :      Son of man , say to Pharaoh , the king of Egypt , and to his horde : in your greatness , whom do you resemble ?     Assyria ! it be Assyria !    a cedar of Lebanon\xe2\x80\x94 beautiful branch ,   thick shade , Towering height ,   its crown in the cloud !    the water make it grow ,   the deep make it tall , let its current flow   around the place it be plant , then send its channel   to all the other tree of the field .    thereupon it tower in height   above all the tree in the field ; its branch be numerous   and its bough long , because of the many water   send to its shoot .   in its branch nest   all the bird of the sky ; under its bough all the wild animal   give birth , and in its shade    dwelt   all the mighty nation .    it be magnificent in size   and in the length of its branch , for its root reach down   to the many water .   in the garden of God ,   no cedar could rival it , no juniper could equal its branch ,   no plane tree match its bough . no tree in the garden of God   could match its beauty .    I make it beautiful   with abundant foliage , so that all the tree in Eden   be envious of it .    therefore , thus say the Lord   God : because it be arrogant about its height ,   lift its crown among the cloud   and exalt itself because of its size ,    I hand it over to a ruler of nation   to deal with it accord to its evil . I have cast it off ,    and foreigner have cut it down , the most ruthless nation ,   have hurl it on the mountain . its bough fall into every valley   and its branch lie broken   in every ravine in the land . all the people of the earth   depart from its shade   when it be hurl down .    on its fallen trunk   sit all the bird of the sky ; beside its fall branch ,   be find all the beast of the field .   this have happen so no well - water tree   will gain such lofty height ,   or lift its crown to the cloud . not one of those feed by water   will tower in height over the rest . for all of they be destine for death ,   for the underworld , among mere mortal ,   with those who go down to the pit .   thus say the Lord   God : on the day it go down to Sheol ,   I make the deep close up   in mourn for it . I restrain the current of the deep ,   and hold back the many water . I darken Lebanon because of it ,   and all the tree of the field   languish because of it .   at the sound of its fall ,   I make nation shudder , when I cast it down to Sheol   with those who go down to the pit . in the underworld   all the tree of Eden take comfort : Lebanons choicest and good ,   all that be feed by the water .    they too will go down to Sheol ,   to those slay by the sword , its ally    who dwelt   in its shade among the nation .   to whom among the tree of Eden   do you compare in glory and greatness ? you will be bring down   with the tree of Eden to the underworld , and lie among the uncircumcised ,   with those slay by the sword . such be Pharaoh and all his hordes\xe2\x80\x94   oracle of the Lord   God .
