b '   Mattathias and his son .     in those day Mattathias , son of John , son of Simeon , a priest of the family of Joarib ,    leave Jerusalem and settle in Modein .        he have five son : John , who be call Gaddi ;      Simon , who be call Thassi ;      Judas , who be call Maccabeus ;      Eleazar , who be call Avaran ; and Jonathan , who be call Apphus .      when he see the sacrilege that be be commit in Judah and in Jerusalem ,      he say : Woe be I ! why be I bear   to see the ruin of my people ,   the ruin of the holy city\xe2\x80\x94 to dwell there   as it be give into the hand of enemy ,   the sanctuary into the hand of stranger ?   her temple have become like a man disgrace ,    her glorious vessel carry off as spoil , her infant murder in her street ,   her youth by the sword of the enemy .    what nation have not take its share of her realm ,   and lay its hand on her spoil ?   all her adornment have be take away .   once free , she have become a slave .   we see our sanctuary lay waste ,   our beauty , our glory . the Gentiles have defile they !    why be we still alive ?     then Mattathias and his son tear their garment , put on sackcloth , and mourn bitterly .    Pagan worship refuse and resist .     the officer of the king in charge of enforce the apostasy come to the city of Modein to make they sacrifice .      many of Israel join they , but Mattathias and his son draw together .      then the officer of the king address Mattathias : you be a leader , an honorable and great man in this city , support by son and kindred .      come now , be the first to obey the king command , as all the Gentiles and Judeans and those who be leave in Jerusalem have do . then you and your son shall be number among the king Friends ,    and you and your son shall be honor with silver and gold and many gift .     but Mattathias answer in a loud voice : although all the Gentiles in the king realm obey he , so that they forsake the religion of their ancestor and consent to the king order ,      yet I and my son and my kindred will keep to the covenant of our ancestor .      Heaven forbid that we should forsake the law and the commandment .      we will not obey the word of the king by depart from our religion in the slight degree .     as he finish say these word , a certain Jew come forward in the sight of all to offer sacrifice on the altar in Modein accord to the king order .      when Mattathias see he , he be fill with zeal ; his heart be move and his just fury be arouse ; he spring forward and kill he upon the altar .      at the same time , he also kill the messenger of the king who be force they to sacrifice , and he tear down the altar .      thus he show his zeal for the law , just as Phinehas do with Zimri , son of Salu .      then Mattathias cry out in the city , let everyone who be zealous for the law and who stand by the covenant follow I !      then he and his son flee to the mountain , leave behind in the city all their possession .      at that time many who seek righteousness and justice go out into the wilderness    to settle there ,      they and their child , their wife and their animal , because misfortune press so hard on they .      it be report to the officer and soldier of the king who be in the City of David , in Jerusalem , that those who have flout the king order have go out to secret refuge in the wilderness .       many hurry out after they , and having catch up with they , camp opposite and prepare to attack they on the sabbath .      the pursuer say to they , enough of this ! come out and obey the king command , and you will live .      but they reply , we will not come out , nor will we obey the king command to profane the sabbath .      then the enemy attack they at once .      but they do not retaliate ; they neither throw stone , nor block up their secret refuge .      they say , let we all die in innocence ; heaven and earth be our witness that you destroy we unjustly .      so the officer and soldier attack they on the sabbath , and they die with their wife , their child and their animal , to the number of a thousand person .     when Mattathias and his friend hear of it , they mourn deeply for they .      they say to one another , if we all do as our kindred have do , and do not fight against the Gentiles for our life and our law , they will soon destroy we from the earth .      so on that day they come to this decision : let we fight against anyone who attack we on the sabbath , so that we may not all die as our kindred die in their secret refuge .     then they be join by a group of Hasideans ,    mighty warrior of Israel , all of they devote to the law .      and all those who be flee from the persecution join they and support they .      they gather an army and strike down sinner in their wrath and the lawless in their anger , and the survivor flee to the Gentiles for safety .      Mattathias and his friend go about and tear down the pagan altar ;      they also forcibly circumcise any uncircumcised boy whom they find in the territory of Israel .      they put to flight the arrogant , and the work prosper in their hand .      they save the law from the hand of the Gentiles and of the king and do not let the sinner triumph .    Farewell of Mattathias .     when the time come for Mattathias to die , he say to his son : arrogance and scorn have now grow strong ; it be a time of disaster and violent wrath .      therefore , my child , be zealous for the law and give your life for the covenant of our ancestor .     remember the deed that our ancestor do in their time ,   and you shall win great honor and an everlasting name .   be not Abraham find faithful in trial ,   and it be credit to he as righteousness ?    Joseph , when in distress , keep the commandment ,   and he become master of Egypt .    Phinehas our ancestor , for his burn zeal ,   receive the covenant of an everlasting priesthood .    Joshua , for execute his commission ,   become a judge in Israel .    Caleb , for bear witness before the assembly ,   receive an inheritance in the land .    David , for his loyalty ,   receive as a heritage a throne of eternal kingship .    Elijah , for his burn zeal for the law ,   be take up to heaven .    Hananiah , Azariah and Mishael , for their faith ,   be save from the fire .    Daniel , for his innocence ,   be deliver from the mouth of lion .    and so , consider this from generation to generation ,   that none who hope in Heaven shall fail in strength .   do not fear the word of sinner ,   for their glory end in corruption and worm .    today exalt , tomorrow not to be find ,   they have return to dust ,   their scheme have perish .   child ! be courageous and strong in keep the law ,   for by it you shall be honor .     here be your brother Simeon who I know be a wise counselor ; listen to he always , and he will be a father to you .      and Judas Maccabeus , a mighty warrior from his youth , shall be the leader of your army and wage the war against the nation .      gather about you all who observe the law , and avenge your people .      pay back the Gentiles what they deserve , and observe the precept of the law .     then he bless they , and he be gather to his ancestor .      he die in the year one hundred and forty - six ,    and be bury in the tomb of his ancestor in Modein , and all Israel mourn he greatly .
