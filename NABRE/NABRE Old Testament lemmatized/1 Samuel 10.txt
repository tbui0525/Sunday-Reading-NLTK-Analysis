b '    then , from a flask he have with he , Samuel pour oil on Sauls head and kiss he , say : the   Lord   anoint you ruler over his people Israel . you be the one who will govern the   Lord s people and save they from the power of their enemy all around they .   the Signs Foretold .   this will be the sign    for you that the   Lord   have anoint you ruler over his heritage :      when you leave I today , you will meet two man near Rachels tomb    at Zelzah in the territory of Benjamin . they will say to you , the donkey you go to look for have be find . now your father be no long worried about the donkey , but be anxious about you and say : what shall I do about my son ?        far on , when you arrive at the oak of Tabor ,    three man will meet you as they go up to God at Bethel ; one will be bring three young goat , another three loaf of bread , and the third a skin of wine .      they will greet you and offer you two elevated offering of bread , which you should accept from they .       after that you will come to Gibeath - elohim , where the philistine garrison    be locate . as you enter that city , you will meet a band of prophet come down from the high place . they will be precede by lyre , tambourine , flute , and harp , and will be in prophetic ecstasy .      the spirit of the   Lord   will rush upon you , and you will join they in their prophetic ecstasy and will become a changed man .        when these sign have come to pass , do whatever lie to hand , because God be with you .       now go down ahead of I to Gilgal , for I shall come down to you , to offer burn offering and to sacrifice communion offering . wait seven day until I come to you ; I shall then tell you what you must do .     the sign come to Pass .     as Saul turn to leave Samuel , God change his heart . that very day all these sign come to pass\xe2\x80\xa6 .       from there they arrive at Gibeah , where a band of prophet meet Saul , and the spirit of God rush upon he , so that he join they in their prophetic ecstasy .        when all who have know he previously see he in a prophetic state among the prophet , they say to one another , what have happen to the son of Kish ? be Saul also among the prophet ?        and someone from that district respond , and who be their father ? thus the saying arise , be Saul also among the prophet ?      when he come out of the prophetic ecstasy , he go home .    silence about the Kingship .     Sauls uncle ask he and his servant , where have you be ? Saul reply , look for the donkey . when we could not find they , we go to Samuel .      Sauls uncle say , tell I , then , what Samuel say to you .      Saul say to his uncle , he assure we that the donkey have be find . but Saul tell he nothing about what Samuel have say about the kingship .    Saul Chosen King .     Samuel call the people together to the   Lord   at Mizpah        and address the Israelites : thus say the   Lord , the God of Israel : it be I who bring Israel up from Egypt and deliver you from the power of the Egyptians and from the power of all the kingdom that oppress you .        but today you have reject your God , who save you from all your evil and calamity , by say , no ! you must appoint a king over we . now , therefore , take your stand before the   Lord   accord to your tribe and family .        so Samuel have all the tribe of Israel come forward , and the tribe of Benjamin be choose .        next he have the tribe of Benjamin come forward by clan , and the clan of Matri be choose , and finally Saul , son of Kish , be choose . but when they go to look for he , he be nowhere to be find .       again they consult the   Lord , be there still someone else to come forward ? the   Lord   answer : he be hide among the baggage .      they run to bring he from there ; when he take his place among the people , he stand head and shoulder above all the people .        then Samuel address all the people , do you see the man whom the   Lord   have choose ? there be no one like he among all the people ! then all the people shout out , long live the king !      Samuel next explain to the people the rule of the monarchy ,    write they in a book , and place they before the presence of the   Lord . Samuel then send the people back to their own home .        Saul also go home to Gibeah , accompany by warrior whose heart the   Lord   have touch .      but some worthless people say , how can this fellow save we ? they despise he and bring he no tribute .
