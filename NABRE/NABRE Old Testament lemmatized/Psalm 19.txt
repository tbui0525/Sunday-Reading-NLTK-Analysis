b ' Gods Glory in the Heavens and in the Law   for the leader . a psalm of David .    I   the heavens declare the glory of God ;   the firmament proclaim the work of his hand .    day unto day pour forth speech ;   night unto night whisper knowledge .    there be no speech , no word ;   their voice be not hear ;   a report go forth through all the earth ,   their message , to the end of the world . he have pitch in they a tent for the sun ;     it come forth like a bridegroom from his canopy ,   and like a hero joyfully run its course .   from one end of the heaven it come forth ;   its course run through to the other ;   nothing escape its heat .    II   the law of the   Lord   be perfect ,   refresh the soul . the decree of the   Lord   be trustworthy ,   give wisdom to the simple .    the precept of the   Lord   be right ,   rejoice the heart . the command of the   Lord   be clear ,   enlighten the eye .   the fear of the   Lord   be pure ,   endure forever . the statute of the   Lord   be true ,   all of they just ;   more desirable than gold ,   than a hoard of pure gold , Sweeter also than honey   or dripping from the comb .    by they your servant be warn ;    obey they bring much reward .    III   who can detect trespass ?   cleanse I from my inadvertent sin .   also from arrogant one restrain your servant ;   let they never control I . then shall I be blameless ,   innocent of grave sin .   let the word of my mouth be acceptable ,   the thought of my heart before you ,   Lord , my rock and my redeemer .
