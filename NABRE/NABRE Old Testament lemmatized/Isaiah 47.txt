b '   the Fall of Babylon    come down , sit in the dust ,   virgin daughter Babylon ; sit on the ground , dethrone ,   daughter of the Chaldeans . no long shall you be call   dainty and delicate .    take the millstone and grind flour ,   remove your veil ; strip off your skirt , bare your leg ,   cross through the stream .   your nakedness shall be uncover ,   and your shame be see ; I will take vengeance ,   I will yield to no entreaty ,   say      our redeemer , whose name be the   Lord   of host ,   the Holy One of Israel .     go into darkness and sit in silence ,   daughter of the Chaldeans , no long shall you be call   sovereign mistress of kingdom .   angry at my people ,   I profane my heritage and give they into your power ;   but you show they no mercy ; upon the aged   you lay a very heavy yoke .   you say , I shall remain always ,   a sovereign mistress forever ! you do not take these thing to heart ,   but disregard their outcome .    now hear this , voluptuous one ,   enthrone securely , say in your heart ,   I , and no one else !   I shall never be a widow ,   bereft of my children\xe2\x80\x94    both these thing shall come to you   suddenly , in a single day : complete bereavement and widowhood   shall come upon you despite your many sorcery   and the full power of your spell ;    secure in your wickedness ,   you say , no one see I . your wisdom and your knowledge   lead you astray , and you say in your heart ,   I , and no one else !   but upon you shall come an evil   you will not be able to charm away ; upon you shall fall a disaster   you can not ward off . upon you shall suddenly come   a ruin you can not imagine .     keep on with your spell   and your many sorcery ,   at which you toil from your youth . perhaps you can prevail ,   perhaps you can strike terror !   you wear yourself out with so many consultation !   let the astrologer stand forth to save you , the stargazer who forecast at each new moon   what would happen to you .   see , they be like stubble ,   fire consume they ; they can not deliver themselves   from the spread flame . this be no warm ember ,   no fire to sit before !   thus do your wizard serve you   with whom you have toil from your youth ; they wander their separate way ,   with none to save you .
