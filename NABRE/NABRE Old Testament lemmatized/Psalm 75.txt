b ' God the Judge of the World   for the leader . do not destroy ! a psalm of Asaph ; a song .    I   we thank you , God , we give thank ;   we call upon your name ,   we declare your wonderful deed . [ you say :]    I will choose the time ;   I will judge fairly .   though the earth and all its inhabitant quake ,   I make steady its pillar .   Selah    II   so I say to the boastful : do not boast !    to the wicked : do not raise your horn !    do not raise your horn against heaven !   do not speak with a stiff neck !    for judgment come not from east or from west ,   not from the wilderness or the mountain ,    but from God who decide ,   who bring some low and raise other high .    yes , a cup    be in the   Lord s hand ,   foam wine , fully spiced . when God pour it out ,   they will drain it even to the dreg ;   all the wicked of the earth will drink .    but I will rejoice forever ;   I will sing praise to the God of Jacob ,    [ who have say :] I will cut off all the horn of the wicked ,   but the horn of the righteous will be exalt .
