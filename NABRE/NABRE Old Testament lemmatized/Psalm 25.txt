b ' Confident Prayer for Forgiveness and Guidance   of David . I to you , o   Lord , I lift up my soul ,     my God , in you I trust ;   do not let I be disgrace ;    do not let my enemy gloat over I .   no one be disgrace who wait for you ,    but only those who be treacherous without cause .   make known to I your way ,   Lord ;   teach I your path .    guide I by your fidelity and teach I ,   for you be God my savior ,   for you I wait all the day long .   remember your compassion and your mercy , O   Lord ,   for they be age old .    remember no more the sin of my youth ;    remember I accord to your mercy ,   because of your goodness ,   Lord .    II   good and upright be the   Lord ,   therefore he show sinner the way ,   he guide the humble in righteousness ,   and teach the humble his way .   all the path of the   Lord   be mercy and truth   toward those who honor his covenant and decree .   for the sake of your name ,   Lord ,   pardon my guilt , though it be great .   who be the one who fear the   Lord ?   God show he the way he should choose .    he will abide in prosperity ,   and his descendant will inherit the land .    the counsel of the   Lord   belong to those who fear he ;   and his covenant instruct they .   my eye be ever upon the   Lord ,   who free my foot from the snare .     III   look upon I , have pity on I ,   for I be alone and afflict .    relieve the trouble of my heart ;   bring I out of my distress .   look upon my affliction and suffering ;   take away all my sin .   see how many be my enemy ,   see how fiercely they hate I .   preserve my soul and rescue I ;   do not let I be disgrace , for in you I seek refuge .   let integrity and uprightness preserve I ;   I wait for you , o   Lord .    redeem Israel , o God ,   from all its distress !
