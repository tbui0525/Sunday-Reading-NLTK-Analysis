b ' a call to praise and obedience I   come , let we sing joyfully to the   Lord ;   cry out to the rock of our salvation .    let we come before he with a song of praise ,   joyfully sing out our psalm .   for the   Lord   be the great God ,   the great king over all god ,    whose hand hold the depth of the earth ;   who own the top of the mountain .   the sea and dry land belong to God ,   who make they , form they by hand .     II   Enter , let we bow down in worship ;   let we kneel before the   Lord   who make we .   for he be our God ,   we be the people he shepherds ,   the sheep in his hand .   III Oh , that today you would hear his voice :     do not harden your heart as at Meribah ,   as on the day of Massah in the desert .    there your ancestor test I ;   they try I though they have see my work .    forty year I loathe that generation ;   I say : this people heart go astray ;   they do not know my way .    therefore I swear in my anger :   they shall never enter my rest .
