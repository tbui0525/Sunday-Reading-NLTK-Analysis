b '    but , object Moses , suppose they do not believe I or listen to I ? for they may say , the   Lord   do not appear to you .      the   Lord   say to he : what be in your hand ? a staff , he answer .      God say : throw it on the ground . so he throw it on the ground and it become a snake ,    and Moses back away from it .      then the   Lord   say to Moses : now stretch out your hand and take hold of its tail . so he stretch out his hand and take hold of it , and it become a staff in his hand .      that be so they will believe that the   Lord , the God of their ancestor , the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob , do appear to you .     again the   Lord   say to he : put your hand into the fold of your garment . so he put his hand into the fold of his garment , and when he draw it out , there be his hand cover with scale , like snowflake .      then God say : put your hand back into the fold of your garment . so he put his hand back into the fold of his garment , and when he draw it out , there it be again like his own flesh .      if they do not believe you or pay attention to the message of the first sign , they should believe the message of the second sign .      and if they do not believe even these two sign and do not listen to you , take some water from the Nile and pour it on the dry land . the water you take from the Nile will become blood on the dry land .     Aarons Office as Assistant .     Moses , however , say to the   Lord , if you please , my Lord , I have never be eloquent , neither in the past nor now that you have speak to your servant ; but I be slow of speech and tongue .        the   Lord   say to he : who give one person speech ? who make another mute or deaf , see or blind ? be it not I , the   Lord ?      now go , I will assist you in speak    and teach you what you be to say .      but he say , if you please , my Lord , send someone else !        then the   Lord   become angry with Moses and say : I know there be your brother , Aaron the Levite , who be a good speaker ; even now he be on his way to meet you . when he see you , he will truly be glad .      you will speak to he and put the word in his mouth . I will assist both you and he in speak and teach you both what you be to do .      he will speak to the people for you : he will be your spokesman ,    and you will be as God to he .        take this staff    in your hand ; with it you be to perform the sign .    Moses Return to Egypt .     after this Moses return to Jethro    his father - in - law and say to he , let I return to my kindred in Egypt , to see whether they be still live . Jethro reply to Moses , go in peace .      then the   Lord   say to Moses in Midian : return to Egypt , for all those who seek your life be dead .      so Moses take his wife and his son , mount they on the donkey , and start back to the land of Egypt . Moses take the staff of God with he .      the   Lord   say to Moses : on your return to Egypt , see that you perform before Pharaoh all the wonder I have put in your power . but I will harden his heart    and he will not let the people go .       so you will say to Pharaoh , thus say the   Lord : Israel be my son , my firstborn .      I say to you : let my son go , that he may serve I . since you refuse to let he go , I will kill your son , your firstborn .       on the journey , at a place where they spend the night , the   Lord   come upon Moses and seek to put he to death .       but Zipporah take a piece of flint and cut off her son foreskin and , touch his foot ,    she say , surely you be a spouse of blood to I .      so God let Moses alone . at that time she say , a spouse of blood , in regard to the circumcision .     the   Lord   say to Aaron : go into the wilderness to meet Moses . so he go ; when meet he at the mountain of God , he kiss he .      Moses tell Aaron everything the   Lord   have send he to say , and all the sign he have command he to do .      then Moses and Aaron go and gather all the elder of the Israelites .      Aaron tell they everything the   Lord   have say to Moses , and he perform the sign before the people .      the people believe , and when they hear that the   Lord   have observe the Israelites and have see their affliction ,    they kneel and bow down .
