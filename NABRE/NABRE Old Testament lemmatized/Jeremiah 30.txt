b '    the Restoration .      this word come to Jeremiah from the   Lord :      thus say the   Lord , the God of Israel : write down on a scroll all the word I have speak to you .        for indeed , the day be coming\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord \xe2\x80\x94when I will restore the fortune of my people Israel and judah\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord . I will bring they back to the land which I give to their ancestor , and they shall take possession of it .      these be the word the   Lord   speak to Israel and to Judah :      thus say the   Lord : we hear a cry of fear :   terror , not peace .   inquire and see :   do a male give birth ? why , then , do I see all these man ,   their hand on their loin like woman in labor ,   all their face drain of color ?    ah ! how mighty be that day\xe2\x80\x94   there be none like it ! a time of distress for Jacob ,   though he shall be save from it .      on that day\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord   of hosts\xe2\x80\x94I will break his yoke off your neck and snap your bond . stranger shall no long enslave they ;        instead , they shall serve the   Lord , their God , and David , their king ,    whom I will raise up for they .      but you , my servant Jacob , do not fear!\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord \xe2\x80\x94   do not be dismay , Israel ! for I will soon deliver you from place far away ,   your offspring from the land of their exile ; Jacob shall again find rest ,   secure , with none to frighten he ,     for I be with you\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord \xe2\x80\x94to save you . I will bring to an end all the nation   among whom I have scatter you ;   but you I will not bring to an end . I will chastise you as you deserve ,   I will not let you go unpunished .     for thus say the   Lord : incurable be your wound ,   grievous your injury ;    there be none to plead your case ,   no remedy for your run sore ,   no healing for you .   all your lover have forget you ,   they do not seek you out . I strike you as an enemy would strike ,   punish you cruelly .    why cry out over your wound ?   there be no relief for your pain . because of your great guilt ,   your numerous sin ,   I have do this to you .    yet all who devour you shall be devour ,   all your enemy shall go into exile . all who plunder you shall become plunder ,   all who pillage you I will hand over to be pillage .    for I will restore your health ;   I will heal your injuries\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord . the outcast they have call you ,   whom no one look for .     thus say the   Lord : see ! I will restore the fortune of Jacobs tent ,   on his dwelling I will have compassion ; a city shall be rebuild upon its own ruin ,   a citadel restore where it should be .    from they will come praise ,   the sound of people rejoice . I will increase they , they will not decrease ,   I will glorify they , they will not be insignificant .    his child shall be as of old ,   his assembly shall stand firm in my presence ,   I will punish all his oppressor .    his leader    shall be one of his own ,   and his ruler shall emerge from his rank . he shall approach I when I summon he ;   why else would he dare   approach me?\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord .   you shall be my people ,   and I will be your God .    look ! the storm of the   Lord !   his wrath break out in a whirling storm   that burst upon the head of the wicked .    the anger of the   Lord   will not abate   until he have carry out completely   the decision of his heart . in day to come   you will fully understand it .
