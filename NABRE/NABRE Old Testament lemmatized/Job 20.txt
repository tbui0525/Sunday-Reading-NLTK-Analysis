b '   Zophars Second Speech .     then Zophar the Naamathite answer and say :     so now my thought provide an answer for I ,   because of the feeling within I .   a rebuke that put I to shame I hear ,   and from my understanding a spirit give I a reply .   do you not know this : from of old ,   since human being be place upon the earth ,   the triumph of the wicked be short   and the joy of the impious but for a moment ?    though his pride mount up to the heaven   and his head reach to the cloud ,   yet he perish forever like the dung he use for fuel ,   and onlooker say , where be he ?    like a dream he take flight and can not be find ;   he fade away like a vision of the night .   the eye which see he do so no more ;   nor shall his dwelling again behold he .   his son will restore to the poor ,   and his hand will yield up his rich .    though his bone be full of youthful vigor ,   it shall lie with he in the dust .   though wickedness be sweet in his mouth ,   and he hide it under his tongue ,   though he retain it and will not let it go   but keep it still within his mouth ,   yet in his stomach the food shall turn ;   it shall be venom of asp inside he .   the rich he swallow he shall vomit up ;   God shall make his belly disgorge they .   the poison of asp he shall drink in ;   the viper fang shall slay he .   he shall see no stream of oil ,    no torrent of honey or milk .   he shall give back his gain , never use ;   like his profit from trade , never enjoy .   because he have oppress and neglect the poor ,   and steal a house he do not build ;   for he have know no quiet in his greed ,   in his treasure he can not save himself .    none of his survivor will consume it ,   therefore his prosperity shall not endure .    when he have more than enough , distress shall be his ,   every sort of trouble shall come upon he .   when he have fill his belly ,   God shall send against he the fury of his wrath   and rain down his missile upon he .   should he escape an iron weapon ,   a bronze bow shall pierce he through ;   the dart shall come out of his back ,   a shining point out of his gall - bladder :   terror fall upon he .   complete darkness be in store for his treasure one ;   a fire unfanned shall consume he ;    any survivor in his tent shall be destroy .   the heaven shall reveal his guilt ,   and the earth rise up against he .   the flood shall sweep away his house ,   torrent in the day of Gods anger .   this be the portion of the wicked ,   the heritage appoint he by God .
