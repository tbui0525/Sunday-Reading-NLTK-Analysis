b '    thus say the   Lord : go down to the palace of the king of Judah and there deliver this word :      you shall say : listen to the word of the   Lord , king of Judah , who sit on the throne of David , you , your minister , and your people who enter by these gate !        thus say the   Lord : do what be right and just . rescue the victim from the hand of their oppressor . do not wrong or oppress the resident alien , the orphan , or the widow , and do not shed innocent blood in this place .        if you carry out these command , king who succeed to the throne of David will continue to enter the gate of this house , ride in chariot or mount on horse , with their minister , and their people .      but if you do not obey these command , I swear by myself\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord : this house shall become rubble .      for thus say the   Lord   concern the house of the king of Judah : though you be to I like Gilead ,   like the peak of Lebanon , I swear I shall turn you into a waste ,   with city uninhabited .   against you I will send destroyer ,   each with their tool : they shall cut down your choice cedar ,   and cast they into the fire .      many nation will pass by this city and ask one another : why have the   Lord   do this to so great a city ?        and they will be tell : because they have desert their covenant with the   Lord , their God , by worship and serve other god .     Jehoahaz   do not weep for he who be dead ,    nor mourn for he ! weep rather for he who be go away ;   never again to see   the land of his birth .      thus say the   Lord   concern Shallum ,    son of Josiah , king of Judah , his father successor , who leave this place : he shall never return ,      but in the place where they exile he , there he shall die ; he shall never see this land again .    Jehoiakim   Woe to he who build his house on wrongdoing ,   his roof - chamber on injustice ; who work his neighbor without pay ,    and give they no wage .    who say , I will build myself a spacious house ,   with airy room , who cut out window for it ,   panel it with cedar ,   and paint it with vermilion .   must you prove your rank among king    by compete with they in cedar ? do not your father eat and drink ,   and act justly and righteously ?   then he prosper .    because he dispense justice to the weak and the poor ,   he prosper . be this not to know me?\xe2\x80\x94   oracle of the   Lord .    but your eye and heart be set on nothing   except your own gain , on shed innocent blood   and practice oppression and extortion .      therefore , thus say the   Lord   concern Jehoiakim , son of Josiah , king of Judah : they shall not lament he ,   Alas ! my brother ; Alas ! sister .   they shall not lament he ,   Alas , Lord ! alas , Majesty !    the burial of a donkey    he shall be give ,   drag forth and cast out   beyond the gate of Jerusalem .     Jeconiah   Climb Lebanon and cry out ,    in Bashan lift up your voice ; cry out from Abarim ,   for all your lover be crush .    I speak to you when you be secure ,   but you answer , I will not listen . this have be your way from your youth ,   not to listen to my voice .   the wind shall shepherd all your shepherd ,   your lover shall go into exile . surely then you shall be ashamed and confound   because of all your wickedness .   you who dwell on Lebanon ,   who nest in the cedar , how you shall groan when pain come upon you ,   like the pang of a woman in childbirth !     as I live\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord \xe2\x80\x94even if you , Coniah ,    son of Jehoiakim , king of Judah , be a signet ring    on my right hand , I would snatch you off .      I will hand you over to those who seek your life , to those you dread : Nebuchadnezzar , king of Babylon , and the Chaldeans .        I will cast you out , you and the mother who bear you ,    into a land different from the land of your birth ; and there you will die ;        neither shall return to the land for which they yearn .      be this man Coniah a thing despise , to be break ,   a vessel that no one want ? why be he and his offspring cast out ?   why throw into a land they do not know ?   o land , land , land ,   hear the word of the   Lord \xe2\x80\x94    thus say the   Lord :    write this man down as childless ,    a man who will never prosper in his life ! nor shall any of his descendant prosper ,   to sit upon the throne of David ,   to rule again over Judah .
