b '   serve Babylon or Perish .     in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah ,    son of Josiah , king of Judah , this word come to Jeremiah from the   Lord :      the   Lord   say to I : make for yourself thong and yoke bar and put they on your shoulder .      send they to the king of Edom , Moab , the Ammonites , Tyre , and Sidon , through the ambassador who have come to Jerusalem to Zedekiah , king of Judah ,        and command they to tell their lord : thus say the   Lord   of host , the God of Israel , thus shall you say to your lord :      it be I who make the earth , human being and beast on the face of the earth , by my great power , with my outstretched arm ; and I can give they to whomever I think fit .        now I have give all these land into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar , king of Babylon , my servant ; even the wild animal I have give he to serve he .        all nation shall serve he and his son and his grandson , until the time come for he and his land ; then many nation and great king will enslave he .        meanwhile , the nation or the kingdom that will not serve he , Nebuchadnezzar , king of Babylon , or bend its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon , I will punish that nation with sword , famine , and pestilence\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord \xe2\x80\x94until I finish they by his hand .      you , however , must not listen to your prophet ,    to your diviner and dreamer , to your soothsayer and sorcerer , who say to you , do not serve the king of Babylon .        for they prophesy lie to you , so as to drive you far from your land , make I banish you so that you perish .        the people that bend the neck to the yoke of the king of Babylon to serve he , I will leave in peace on its own land\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord \xe2\x80\x94to cultivate it and dwell on it .      to Zedekiah , king of Judah , I speak the same word : bend your neck to the yoke of the king of Babylon ; serve he and his people , so that you may live .        why should you and your people die by sword , famine , and pestilence , in accordance with the word the   Lord   have speak to the nation that will not serve the king of Babylon ?        do not listen to the word of the prophet who say to you , do not serve the king of Babylon . they prophesy lie to you !        I do not send them\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord \xe2\x80\x94but they prophesy falsely in my name . as a result I must banish you , and you will perish , you and the prophet who be prophesy to you .       to the priest and to all the people I say : thus say the   Lord : do not listen to the word of your prophet who prophesy to you : the vessel of the house of the   Lord   will soon be bring back from Babylon , for they prophesy lie to you .      do not listen to they ! serve the king of Babylon that you may live . why should this city become rubble ?      if they be prophet , if the word of the   Lord   be with they , then they would intercede with the   Lord   of host , that the vessel remain in the house of the   Lord   and in the house of the king of Judah and in Jerusalem should not also go to Babylon .      for thus say the   Lord   of host concern the pillar , the sea , the stand , and the rest of the vessel remain in this city ,      which Nebuchadnezzar , king of Babylon , do not take when he exile Jeconiah , son of Jehoiakim , king of Judah , from Jerusalem to Babylon , along with all the noble of Judah and Jerusalem\xe2\x80\x94      thus say the   Lord   of host , the God of Israel , concern the vessel remain in the house of the   Lord , in the house of the king of Judah , and in Jerusalem :        to Babylon they shall go , and there they shall remain , until the day I look for them\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord ; then I will bring they back and restore they to this place .
