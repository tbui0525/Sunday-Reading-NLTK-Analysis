b '    every friend declare friendship ,   but there be friend who be friend in name only .    be it not a sorrow unto death   when your other self become your enemy ?   Alas , my companion ! why be you create   to fill the earth with deceit ?   a harmful friend will look to your table ,   but in time of trouble he stand aloof .   a good friend will fight with you against the foe ,   and against your enemy he will hold up your shield .   do not forget your comrade during the battle ,   and do not neglect he when you distribute your spoil .     every counselor point out a way ,   but some counsel way of their own .   watch out when one offer advice ;   find out first of all what he want . for he also may be think of himself\xe2\x80\x94   why should the opportunity fall to he ?   he may tell you how good your way will be ,   and then stand by to see you impoverished .   seek no advice from your father - in - law ,   and from one who be envious of you , keep your intention hide .   seek no advice from a woman about her rival ,   from a coward about war ,   from a merchant about business ,   from a buyer about value ,   from a miser about generosity ,   from a cruel person about well - being ,   from a worthless worker about his work ,   from a seasonal laborer about the harvest ,   from an idle slave about a great task\xe2\x80\x94   pay no attention to any advice they give .     instead , associate with a religious person ,   who you know keep the commandment ; who be like - minded with yourself   and will grieve for you if you fall .   then , too , heed your own heart counsel ;   for there be nothing you can depend on more .   the heart can reveal your situation   well than seven sentinel on a tower .   then with all this , pray to God   to make your step firm in the true path .    Wisdom and Temperance   a word be the source of every deed ;    a thought , of every act .    the root of all conduct be the heart ;    four branch it shoot forth : good and evil , death and life ,   and their absolute mistress be the tongue .    one may be wise and benefit many ,   yet appear foolish to himself .   one may be wise , but if his word be reject ,   he will be deprive of all enjoyment .    when one be wise to his own advantage ,   the fruit of knowledge be see in his own person .   when one be wise to the advantage of people ,   the fruit of knowledge be last .    one wise for himself have full enjoyment ,   and all who see he praise he .   the day of one life be number ,   but the life of Israel , day without number .   one wise among the people win a heritage of glory ,   and his name live on and on .      my son , while you be well , govern your appetite ,    and see that you do not allow it what be bad for you .   for not everything be good for everyone ,   nor be everything suited to every taste .    do not go to excess with any enjoyment ,    neither become a glutton for choice food ;   for sickness come with overeating ,   and gluttony bring on nausea .   through lack of self - control many have die ,   but the abstemious one prolong life .
