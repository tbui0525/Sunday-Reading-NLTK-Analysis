b '   Nathan , David , and Solomon   after he come   Nathan    who serve in Davids presence .    like the choice fat of sacred offering ,   so be   David   in Israel .    he play with lion as though they be young goat ,   and with bear , like lamb of the flock .    as a youth he strike down the giant   and wipe out the people disgrace ; his hand let fly the slingstone   that shatter the pride of Goliath .    for he have call upon the most high God ,   who give strength to his right arm to defeat the skilled warrior   and establish the might of his people .   therefore the woman sing his praise   and honor he for the ten of thousand . when he receive the royal crown , he battle     and subdue the enemy on every side . he campaign against the hostile Philistines   and shatter their power till our own day .    with his every deed he offer thank   to God most High , in word of praise . with his whole heart he love his maker    and daily have his praise sing ;   he add beauty to the feast   and solemnize the season of each year   with string music before the altar ,   provide sweet melody for the psalm    so that when the Holy Name be praise ,   before daybreak the sanctuary would resound .   the   Lord   forgave he his sin   and exalt his strength forever ; he confer on he the right of royalty   and establish his throne in Israel .      because of his merit he have as successor    a wise son , who live in security :    Solomon   reign during an era of peace ,   for God bring rest to all his border . he build a house to the name of God ,   and establish a last sanctuary .    how wise you be when you be young ,   overflow with instruction , like the Nile in flood !    your understanding cover the whole earth ,   and , like a sea , fill it with knowledge .   your fame reach distant coast ,   and you be belove for your peaceful reign .   with song and proverb and riddle ,   and with your answer , you astound the nation .   you be call by that glorious name   which be confer upon Israel .   Gold you gather like so much iron ;   you heap up silver as though it be lead .   but you abandon yourself to woman   and give they dominion over your body .    you bring a stain upon your glory ,   shame upon your marriage bed , Wrath upon your descendant ,   and groan upon your deathbed .   thus two government come into being ,   when in Ephraim kingship be usurp .    but God do not withdraw his mercy ,   nor permit even one of his promise to fail . he do not uproot the posterity of the choose ,   nor destroy the offspring of his friend . so he give to Jacob a remnant ,   to David a root from his own family .     Rehoboam and Jeroboam   Solomon finally sleep with his ancestor ,   and leave behind he one of his son , Broad    in folly , narrow in sense ,   whose policy make the people rebel . then arise the one who should not be remember ,   the sinner who lead Israel into sin ,   who bring ruin to Ephraim    and cause they to be exile from their land .    Elijah and Elisha   their sinfulness grow more and more ,   and they give themselves to every evil              '
