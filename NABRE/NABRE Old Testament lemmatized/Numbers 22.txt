b '    then the Israelites move on and encamp in the plain of Moab    on the other side of the Jordan opposite Jericho .    Balaam summon .     Now Balak , son of Zippor , see all that Israel do to the Amorites ,      and Moab fear the Israelites greatly because they be numerous . Moab be in dread of the Israelites .      so Moab say to the elder of Midian , now this horde will devour everything around we as an ox devour the grass of the field . at that time Balak , son of Zippor , be king of Moab ;      and he send messenger to Balaam , son of Beor , at Pethor on the river , in the land of the Ammonites ,    to summon he with these word , a people have come out of Egypt ! they have cover up the earth and be settle down opposite I !      now come , curse this people for I ,    since they be strong than I be . perhaps I may be able to defeat they and drive they out of the land . for I know that whoever you bless be bless and whoever you curse be curse .      so the elder of Moab and the elder of Midian , themselves expert in divination ,    leave and go to Balaam , to whom they give Balaks message .      he say to they , stay here overnight , and I will give you whatever answer the   Lord   give I . so the prince of Moab lodge with Balaam .     then God come to Balaam and say : who be these man with you ?      Balaam answer God , Balak , son of Zippor , king of Moab , send I the message :      this people that have come out of Egypt have cover up the earth . now come , lie a curse on they for I ; perhaps I may be able to fight they and drive they out .      but God say to Balaam : do not go with they and do not curse this people , for they be bless .      the next morning Balaam arise and tell the prince of Balak , go back to your own country , for the   Lord   have refuse to let I go with you .      so the prince of Moab go back to Balak with the report , Balaam refuse to come with we .    Second Appeal to Balaam .     Balak yet again send prince , who be more numerous and more distinguished than the other .      on come to Balaam they tell he , thus say Balak , son of Zippor : please do not refuse to come to I .      I will reward you very handsomely and will do anything you ask of I . come , lie a curse on this people for I .       but Balaam reply to Balaks servant , even if Balak give I his house full of silver and gold , I could not do anything , small or great , contrary to the command of the   Lord , my God .      but , you too stay here overnight , so that I may learn what else the   Lord   may say to I .      that night God come to Balaam and say to he : if these man have come to summon you , go back with they ; yet only on the condition that you do exactly as I tell you .      so the next morning when Balaam arise , he saddle his donkey ,    and go off with the prince of Moab .    the talk Donkey .     but now Gods anger flare up    at he for go , and the angel of the   Lord   take up a position on the road as his adversary . as Balaam be ride along on his donkey , accompany by two of his servant ,      the donkey see the angel of the   Lord   stand in the road with sword draw . the donkey turn off the road and go into the field , and Balaam beat the donkey to bring she back on the road .      then the angel of the   Lord   stand in a narrow lane between vineyard with a stone wall on each side .      when the donkey see the angel of the   Lord   there , she press against the wall ; and since she squeeze Balaams leg against the wall , he beat she again .      then the angel of the   Lord   again go ahead , and stand next in a passage so narrow that there be no room to move either to the right or to the left .      when the donkey see the angel of the   Lord   there , she lie down under Balaam . Balaams anger flare up and he beat the donkey with his stick .      then the   Lord   open the mouth of the donkey , and she ask Balaam , what have I do to you that you beat I these three time ?      you have act so willfully against I , say Balaam to the donkey , that if I only have a sword at hand , I would kill you here and now .      but the donkey say to Balaam , be I not your donkey , on which you have always ride until now ? have I be in the habit of treat you this way before ? no , he reply .     then the   Lord   open Balaams eye , so that he see the angel of the   Lord   stand on the road with sword draw ; and he kneel and bow down to the ground .      but the angel of the   Lord   say to he : why have you beat your donkey these three time ? I have come as an adversary because this rash journey of yours be against my will .      when the donkey see I , she turn away from I these three time . if she have not turn away from I , you be the one I would have kill , though I would have spare she .      then Balaam say to the angel of the   Lord , I have sin . yet I do not know that you take up a position to oppose my journey . since it have displease you , I will go back home .      but the angel of the   Lord   say to Balaam : go with the man ; but you may say only what I tell you . so Balaam go on with the prince of Balak .     when Balak hear that Balaam be come , he go out to meet he at Ar - Moab on the border form by the Arnon , at its most distant point .      and Balak say to Balaam , do I not send an urgent summon to you ? why do you not come to I ? do you think I could not reward you ?      Balaam answer Balak , well , I have come to you after all . but what power have I to say anything ? I can speak only what God put in my mouth .      then Balaam go with Balak , and they come to Kiriath - huzoth .      here Balak sacrifice oxen and sheep , and send portion to Balaam and to the prince who be with he .    the First Oracle .     the next morning Balak take Balaam up on Bamoth - baal , and from there he could see some of the people .
