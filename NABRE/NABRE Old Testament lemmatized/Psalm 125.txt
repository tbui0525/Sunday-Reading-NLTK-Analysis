b ' Israels Protector   a song of ascent . those trust in the   Lord   be like Mount Zion ,   unshakable , forever endure .    as mountain surround Jerusalem ,   the   Lord   surround his people   both now and forever .      the scepter of the wicked will not prevail   in the land allot to the just ,   lest the just themselves   turn their hand to evil .     do good ,   Lord , to the good ,   to those who be upright of heart .    but those who turn aside to crooked way   may the   Lord   send down with the evildoer .   Peace upon Israel !              '
