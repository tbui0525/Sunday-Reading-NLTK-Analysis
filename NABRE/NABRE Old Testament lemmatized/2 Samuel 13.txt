Davids son Absalom have a beautiful sister name Tamar , and Davids son Amnon love she .        he be in such anguish over his sister Tamar that he become sick ; she be a virgin , and Amnon think it impossible to do anything to she .      now Amnon have a friend name Jonadab , son of Davids brother Shimeah , who be very clever .         he ask he , Prince , why be you so dejected morning after morning ? why not tell I ? so Amnon say to he , I be in love with Tamar , my brother Absaloms sister .      then Jonadab reply , lie down on your bed and pretend to be sick . when your father come to visit you , say to he , please let my sister Tamar come and encourage I to take food . if she prepare something in my presence , for I to see , I will eat it from her hand .      so Amnon lie down and pretend to be sick . when the king come to visit he , Amnon say to the king , please let my sister Tamar come and prepare some fry cake before my eye , that I may take food from her hand .     David then send home a message to Tamar , please go to the house of your brother Amnon and prepare some food for he .      Tamar go to the house of her brother Amnon , who be in bed . take dough and knead it , she twist it into cake before his eye and fry the cake .      then she take the pan and set out the cake before he . but Amnon would not eat ; he say , have everyone leave I . when they have all leave he ,      Amnon say to Tamar , bring the food into the bedroom , that I may have it from your hand . so Tamar pick up the cake she have prepare and bring they to her brother Amnon in the bedroom .      but when she bring they close to he so he could eat , he seize she and say to she , come ! lie with I , my sister !      but she answer he , no , my brother ! do not force I ! this be not do in Israel . do not commit this terrible crime .        where would I take my shame ? and you would be label a fool in Israel .    so please , speak to the king ; he will not keep I from you .        but he would not listen to she ; he be too strong for she : he force she down and rape she .      then Amnon feel intense hatred for she ; the hatred he feel for she far surpass the love he have have for she . Amnon say to she , get up , leave .      she reply , no , brother , because send I away would be far bad than this evil thing you have do to I . he would not listen to she ,      but call the youth who be his attendant and say , send this girl outside , away from I , and bar the door after she .      now she have on a long tunic , for that be how virgin princess dress in olden day . when his attendant put she out and bar the door after she ,      Tamar put ashe on her head and tear the long tunic in which she be clothe . then , put her hand to her head , she go away cry loudly .      her brother Absalom say to she : have your brother Amnon be with you ? keep still now , my sister ; he be your brother . do not take this so to heart . so Tamar remain , devastate , in the house of her brother Absalom .      King David , when he hear of the whole affair , become very angry . he would not , however , antagonize Amnon , his high - spirited son ; he love he , because he be his firstborn .      and Absalom say nothing , good or bad , to Amnon ; but Absalom hate Amnon for having humiliate his sister Tamar .

Absalom then say , if not you , then please let my brother Amnon come with we . the king ask he , why should he go with you ?      but at Absaloms urging , the king send Amnon and with he all his other son . Absalom prepare a banquet fit for a king .       but Absalom have instruct his attendant : now watch ! when Amnon be merry with wine and I say to you , kill Amnon , put he to death . do not be afraid , for it be I who order you to do it . be strong and act like warrior .    death of Amnon .     when the attendant do to Amnon as Absalom have command , all the king other son rise up , mount their mule , and flee .      while they be still on the road , a report reach David : Absalom have kill all the king son and not one of they be leave .      the king stand up , tear his garment , and lie on the ground . all his servant stand by he also tear their garment .        but Jonadab , son of Davids brother Shimeah , speak up : let not my lord think that all the young man , the king son , have be kill ! Amnon alone be dead , for Absalom be set on this ever since Amnon humiliate his sister Tamar .      now let my lord the king not take so to heart that report , all the king son be dead .
