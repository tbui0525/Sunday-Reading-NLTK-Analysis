b ' the Exodus and Conquest , Pledge of Future help   for the leader . a psalm of David ; a song .    I    may God arise ;   may his enemy be scatter ;   may those who hate he flee before he .    as the smoke be disperse , disperse they ;   as wax be melt by fire ,   so may the wicked perish before God .    then the just will be glad ;   they will rejoice before God ;   they will celebrate with great joy .    II   sing to God , praise his name ;   exalt the rider of the cloud .   rejoice before he   whose name be the   Lord .    Father of the fatherless , defender of widow   \xe2\x80\x94   God in his holy abode ,   God give a home to the forsaken ,   who lead prisoner out to prosperity ,   while rebel live in the desert .     III   God , when you go forth before your people ,    when you march through the desert , Selah   the earth quake , the heavens pour ,   before God , the one of Sinai ,   before God , the God of Israel .   you pour abundant rain , God ,   your inheritance be weak and you repair it .   your creature dwelt in it ;   you will establish it in your goodness for the poor , o God .    IV   the Lord announce :   those bring news be a great Army .    the king of the army be in desperate flight .   every household will share the spoil ,    though you lie down among the sheepfold ,    you shall be cover with silver as the wing of a dove ,   her feather bright as fine gold .   when the Almighty rout the king there ,   it will be as when snow fall on Zalmon .     V   you mountain of God , mountain of Bashan ,   you rugged mountain , mountain of Bashan ,   you rugged mountain , why look with envy   at the mountain    where God have choose to dwell ,   where the   Lord   reside forever ?    Gods chariot be myriad , thousand upon thousand ;   from Sinai the Lord enter the holy place .   you go up to its lofty height ;   you take captive , receive slave as tribute ,    even rebel , for the   Lord   God to dwell .    VI   bless be the Lord day by day ,   God , our salvation , who carry we .   Selah   our God be a God who save ;   escape from death be the   Lord   Gods .   God will crush the head of his enemy ,   the hairy scalp of the one who walk in sin .    the Lord have say :   even from Bashan I will fetch they ,   fetch they even from the depth of the sea .    you will wash your foot in your enemys blood ;   the tongue of your dog will lap it up .     VII    your procession come into view , o God ,   your procession into the holy place , my God and king .   the singer go first , the harpist follow ;   in their midst girl sound the timbrel .    in your choir , bless God ;   Lord , Israels fountain .   in the lead be Benjamin , few in number ;   there the prince of Judah , a large throng ,   the prince of Zebulun , the prince of Naphtali , too .     VIII   Summon again , o God , your power ,   the divine power you once show for we ,   from your temple on behalf of Jerusalem ,   that king may bring you tribute .   Roar at the wild beast of the reed ,    the herd of mighty bull , the calf of the people ;   trample those who lust after silver   scatter the people that delight in war .   let bronze be bring from Egypt ,    Ethiopia hurry its hand to God .     IX   you kingdom of the earth , sing to God ;    chant the praise of the Lord , Selah   who ride the height of the ancient heaven ,   who send forth his voice as a mighty voice ?   confess the power of God ,   whose majesty protect Israel ,   whose power be in the sky .   awesome be God in his holy place ,   the God of Israel ,   who give power and strength to his people .   bless be God !
