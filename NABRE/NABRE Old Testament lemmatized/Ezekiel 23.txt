b '   the two Sisters .      the word of the   Lord   come to I :      Son of man , there be two woman , daughter of the same mother .        even as young girl , they be prostitute , serve as prostitute in Egypt . there the Egyptians fondle their breast and caress their virgin nipple .        Oholah be the name of the elder , and the name of her sister be Oholibah .    they become mine and give birth to son and daughter .    as for their name : Samaria be Oholah and Jerusalem , Oholibah .       Oholah become a prostitute while marry to I and lust after her lover , the Assyrians : warrior      dress in purple , governor and officer , all of they handsome young soldier , mount on horse .      she give herself as a prostitute to they , to all the assyrian elite ; with all those for whom she lust , she also defile herself with their idol .      she do not abandon the prostitution she have begin with the Egyptians , who have lie with she when she be young , fondle her virgin breast and pour out their lust upon she .        therefore I hand she over to her lover , to the Assyrians for whom she lust .       they expose her nakedness ; her son and daughter they take away , and she they kill with the sword . she become a byword for woman because of the sentence carry out against she .     although her sister Oholibah see all this , her lust be more depraved than her sister ; she outdo she in prostitution .        she too lust after the Assyrians , governor and officer , warrior impeccably clothe , mount on horse , all of they handsome young soldier .        I see that she have defile herself\xe2\x80\x94now both have go down the same path .      she go far in her prostitution : she see male figure draw on the wall , image of Chaldeans draw with vermilion ,      with sash tie about their waist , flow turban on their head , all look like chariot warrior , image of Babylonians , native of Chaldea .      as soon as she set eye on they she lust for they , and she send messenger to they in Chaldea .        the Babylonians come to she , to her love couch ; they defile she with their impurity . but as soon as they have defile she , she recoil from they .      when her prostitution be discover and her shame reveal , I recoil from she as I have recoil from her sister .      but she increase her prostitution , recall the day of her youth when she have serve as a prostitute in the land of Egypt .      she lust for the lecher of Egypt , whose member be like those of donkey , whose thrust be like those of stallion .     you revert to the depravity of your youth , when Egyptians fondle your breast , caress your young nipple .      therefore , Oholibah , thus say the Lord   God : I will now stir up your lover against you , those from whom you recoil , and I will bring they against you from every side :      the man of Babylon and all of Chaldea , Pekod , Shoa and Koa ,    along with all the Assyrians , handsome young soldier , all of they governor and officer , charioteer and warrior , all of they horseman .      they shall invade you with armor , chariot and wagon , a horde of people ; they will array against you on every side buckler and shield and helmet . I will give they the right of judgment , and they will judge you accord to their standard .        I will direct my jealousy against you , so that they deal with you in fury , cut off your nose and ear ; what be leave of you shall fall by the sword . they shall take away your son and daughter , and what be leave of you shall be devour by fire .      they shall strip off your clothe and seize your splendid jewelry .      I will put an end to your depravity and to your prostitution from the land of Egypt ; you shall no long look to they , nor even remember Egypt again .     for thus say the Lord   God : I be now hand you over to those whom you hate , to those from whom you recoil .      they shall treat you with hatred , seize all that you work for and leave you stark naked , so that your indecent nakedness be expose .    your depravity and prostitution      bring these thing upon you because you serve as a prostitute for the nation , defile yourself with their idol .      because you follow your sister path , I will put her cup into your hand .       thus say the Lord   God :   the cup of your sister you shall drink ,   deep and wide ; it bring ridicule and mockery ,   it hold so much ;   you will be fill with drunkenness and grief\xe2\x80\x94   a cup of horror and devastation ,   the cup of your sister Samaria ;   you shall drink it dry ,   its very sherd you will gnaw ; and you shall tear out your breast ;   for I have spoken\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the Lord   God .     therefore thus say the Lord   God : you have forget I and cast I behind your back ; now suffer for your depravity and prostitution .      then the   Lord   say to I : Son of man , would you judge Oholah and Oholibah ? then make known to they their abomination .        for they commit adultery , and blood cover their hand . they commit adultery with their idol ; even the child they bear for I they burn as food for they .      and they also do this to I : on that day , they defile my sanctuary and desecrate my sabbath .      on the very day they slaughter their child for their idol , they enter my sanctuary to desecrate it . thus they act within my house !        moreover , they send for man who have to come from afar ; when a messenger be send to they , they come . on their account you bathe , paint your eye , and put on jewelry .        you sit on a magnificent couch , set before it a table , on which to lay my incense and oil .      the cry of a mob ! the shout of man come in from the wilderness ! they put bracelet on the women arm and splendid crown on their head .      I say : that wear - out one still have adultery in she ! now they engage she as a prostitute and she\xe2\x80\xa6      and indeed they do come in to she as man come in to a prostitute . thus they come to Oholah and Oholibah , the depraved woman .      the righteous shall certainly punish they with sentence give to adulterer and murderer , for they commit adultery , and blood be on their hand .      indeed , thus say the Lord   God : raise up an army against they and hand they over to terror and plunder .      the army will stone they and hack they to piece with their sword . they will kill their son and daughter and set fire to their house .      thus I will put an end to depravity in the land , and all woman will be warn not to imitate your depravity .      they shall inflict on you the penalty of your depravity , and you shall pay for your sin of idolatry . then you shall know that I be the Lord   God .
