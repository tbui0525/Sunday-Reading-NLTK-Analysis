b ' praise of God the Creator I   bless the   Lord , my soul !   Lord , my God , you be great indeed ! you be clothe with majesty and splendor ,    robe in light as with a cloak . you spread out the heavens like a tent ;     set the beam of your chamber upon the water .   you make the cloud your chariot ;   travel on the wing of the wind .   you make the wind your messenger ;   flame fire , your minister .     II    you fix the earth on its foundation ,   so it can never be shake .   the deep cover it like a garment ;   above the mountain stand the water .   at your rebuke they take flight ;   at the sound of your thunder they flee .    they rush up the mountain , down the valley   to the place you have fix for they .   you set a limit they can not pass ;   never again will they cover the earth .     III   you make spring flow in wadies   that wind among the mountain .   they give drink to every beast of the field ;    here wild ass quench their thirst .   beside they the bird of heaven nest ;   among the branch they sing .   you water the mountain from your chamber ;   from the fruit of your labor the earth abound .   you make the grass grow for the cattle   and plant for people work   to bring forth food from the earth ,   wine to gladden their heart ,   oil to make their face shine ,   and bread to sustain the human heart .    the tree of the   Lord   drink their fill ,   the cedar of Lebanon , which you plant .   there the bird build their nest ;   the stork in the juniper , its home .    the high mountain be for wild goat ;   the rocky cliff , a refuge for badger .    IV   you make the moon to mark the season ,    the sun that know the hour of its setting .   you bring darkness and night fall ,   then all the animal of the forest wander about .   young lion roar for prey ;   they seek their food from God .    when the sun rise , they steal away   and settle down in their dens .   People go out to their work ,   to their labor till evening fall .    v   how varied be your work ,   Lord !   in wisdom you have make they all ;   the earth be full of your creature .    there be the sea , great and wide !   it teem with countless being ,   live thing both large and small .    there ship ply their course   and Leviathan ,    whom you form to play with .     VI   all of these look to you   to give they food in due time .    when you give it to they , they gather ;   when you open your hand , they be well fill .    when you hide your face , they panic .   take away their breath , they perish   and return to the dust .    send forth your spirit , they be create   and you renew the face of the earth .    VII   may the glory of the   Lord   endure forever ;   may the   Lord   be glad in his work !   who look at the earth and it tremble ,   touch the mountain and they smoke !    I will sing to the   Lord   all my life ;   I will sing praise to my God while I live .    may my meditation be pleasing to he ;   I will rejoice in the   Lord .   may sinner vanish from the earth ,   and the wicked be no more . bless the   Lord , my soul ! Hallelujah !              '
