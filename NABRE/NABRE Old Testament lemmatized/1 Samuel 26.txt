Abishai whisper to David : God have deliver your enemy into your hand today . let I nail he to the ground with one thrust of the spear ; I will not need to strike he twice !        but David say to Abishai , do not harm he , for who can lay a hand on the   Lord s anoint and remain innocent ?      as the   Lord   live , David declare , only the   Lord   can strike he : either when the time come for he to die , or when he go out and perishe in battle .         but the   Lord   forbid that I lay a hand on the   Lord s anoint ! now take the spear at his head and the water jug , and let we be on our way .      so David take the spear and the water jug from their place at Sauls head , and they withdraw without anyone see or know or awaken . all remain asleep , because a deep slumber    from the   Lord   have fall upon they .
