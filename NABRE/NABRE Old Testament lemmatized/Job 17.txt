b '    my spirit be break , my day finish ,   my burial at hand .   surely mocker surround I ,   at their provocation , my eye grow dim .   put up a pledge for I with you :    who be there to give surety for I ?   you darken their mind to knowledge ;   therefore you will not exalt they .   for a share of property he inform on friend ,   while the eye of his child grow dim .   I be make a byword of the people ;    I be one at whom people spit .   my eye be blind with anguish ,   and my whole frame be like a shadow .   the upright be astonish at this ,   the innocent arouse against the wicked .   the righteous hold to his way ,   the one with clean hand increase in strength .   but turn now , and come on again ;   I do not find a wise man among you !   my day pass by , my plan be at an end ,   the yearning of my heart .   they would change the night into day ;   where there be darkness they talk of approach light .    if my only hope be dwell in Sheol ,   and spread my couch in darkness ,   if I be to say to the pit , you be my father ,   and to the worm my mother , my sister ,   where then be my hope ,   my happiness , who can see it ?   will they descend with I into Sheol ?   shall we go down together into the dust ?
