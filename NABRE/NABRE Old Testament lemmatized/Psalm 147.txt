b ' Gods Word Restores Jerusalem   Hallelujah ! I how good to sing praise to our God ;   how pleasant to give fitting praise .    the   Lord   rebuild Jerusalem ,   and gather the disperse of Israel ,    heal the brokenhearted ,   and bind up their wound .    he number the star ,   and give to all of they their name .    great be our Lord , vast in power ,   with wisdom beyond measure .    the   Lord   give aid to the poor ,   but cast the wicked to the ground .     II   sing to the   Lord   with thanksgiving ;   with the lyre make music to our God ,     who cover the heaven with cloud ,   provide rain for the earth ,   make grass sprout on the mountain ,    who give animal their food   and young raven what they cry for .     he take no delight in the strength of horse ,   no pleasure in the runner stride .    rather the   Lord   take pleasure in those who fear he ,   those who put their hope in his mercy .    III   glorify the   Lord , Jerusalem ;   Zion , offer praise to your God ,   for he have strengthen the bar of your gate ,   bless your child within you .    he bring peace to your border ,   and satisfy you with fine wheat .     he send his command to earth ;   his word run swiftly !    thus he make the snow like wool ,   and spread the frost like ash ;    he disperse hail like crumb .   who can withstand his cold ?   yet when again he issue his command , it melt they ;   he raise his wind and the water flow .   he proclaim his word to Jacob ,   his statute and law to Israel .    he have not do this for any other nation ;   of such law they know nothing . Hallelujah !             '
