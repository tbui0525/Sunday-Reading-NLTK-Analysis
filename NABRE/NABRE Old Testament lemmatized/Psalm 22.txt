b ' the Prayer of an Innocent Person   for the leader ; accord to the deer of the dawn .    a psalm of David .    I   my God , my God , why have you abandon I ?   why so far from my call for help ,   from my cry of anguish ?    my God , I call by day , but you do not answer ;   by night , but I have no relief .    yet you be enthrone as the Holy one ;   you be the glory of Israel .    in you our father trust ;   they trust and you rescue they .   to you they cry out and they escape ;   in you they trust and be not disappointed .     but I be a worm , not a man ,   scorn by man , despise by the people .    all who see I mock I ;   they curl their lip and je ;   they shake their head at I :    he rely on the   Lord \xe2\x80\x94let he deliver he ;   if he love he , let he rescue he .    for you draw I forth from the womb ,   make I safe at my mother breast .   upon you I be thrust from the womb ;   since my mother bear I you be my God .    do not stay far from I ,   for trouble be near ,   and there be no one to help .     II   many bull    surround I ;   fierce bull of Bashan encircle I .   they open their mouth against I ,   lion that rend and roar .    like water my life drain away ;   all my bone be disjointed . my heart have become like wax ,   it melt away within I .   as dry as a potsherd be my throat ;   my tongue cleave to my palate ;   you lay I in the dust of death .    dog surround I ;   a pack of evildoer close in on I . they have pierce my hand and my foot    I can count all my bone .   they stare at I and gloat ;    they divide my garment among they ;   for my clothing they cast lot .    but you ,   Lord , do not stay far off ;   my strength , come quickly to help I .   deliver my soul from the sword ,   my life from the grip of the dog .   save I from the lion mouth ,   my poor life from the horn of wild bull .     III   then I will proclaim your name to my brother ;   in the assembly I will praise you :     you who fear the   Lord , give praise !   all descendant of Jacob , give honor ;   show reverence , all descendant of Israel !   for he have not spurn or disdain   the misery of this poor wretch , do not turn away    from I ,   but hear I when I cry out .   I will offer praise in the great assembly ;   my vow I will fulfill before those who fear he .   the poor    will eat their fill ;   those who seek the   Lord   will offer praise .   may your heart enjoy life forever !     IV   all the end of the earth   will remember and turn to the   Lord ; all the family of nation   will bow low before he .    for kingship belong to the   Lord ,   the ruler over the nation .     all who sleep in the earth   will bow low before God ; all who have go down into the dust   will kneel in homage .   and I will live for the   Lord ;   my descendant will serve you .   the generation to come will be tell of the Lord ,   that they may proclaim to a people yet unborn   the deliverance you have bring .
