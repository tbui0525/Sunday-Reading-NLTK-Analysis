b '   the anointed Bearer of Glad Tidings    the spirit of the Lord   God   be upon I ,   because the   Lord   have anoint I ; he have send I to bring good news to the afflict ,   to bind up the brokenhearted , to proclaim liberty to the captive ,   release to the prisoner ,    to announce a year of favor from the   Lord   and a day of vindication by our God ; to comfort all who mourn ;     to place on those who mourn in Zion   a diadem instead of ashe , to give they oil of gladness instead of mourn ,   a glorious mantle instead of a faint spirit . restoration and Blessing they will be call oak of justice ,   the planting of the   Lord   to show his glory .   they shall rebuild the ancient ruin ,   the former waste they shall raise up and restore the desolate city ,   devastation of generation upon generation .    stranger shall stand ready to pasture your flock ,   foreigner shall be your farmer and vinedresser .    you yourself shall be call priest of the   Lord ,   Ministers of our God you shall be call . you shall eat the wealth of the nation   and in their rich you will boast .    because their shame be twofold    and disgrace be proclaim their portion , they will possess twofold in their own land ;   everlaste joy shall be theirs .     god Word of promise   for I , the   Lord , love justice ,   I hate robbery and wrongdoing ; I will faithfully give they their recompense ,   an everlasting covenant I will make with they .    their offspring shall be renowne among the nation ,   and their descendant in the midst of the people ; all who see they shall acknowledge they :   they be offspre the   Lord   have bless .    Thanksgiving for Gods Deliverance    I will rejoice heartily in the   Lord ,   my be exult in my God ; for he have clothe I with garment of salvation ,   and wrap I in a robe of justice , like a bridegroom adorn with a diadem ,   as a bride adorn herself with her jewel .    as the earth bring forth its shoot ,   and a garden make its seed spring up , so will the Lord   God   make justice spring up ,   and praise before all the nation .
