b '    the   Lord   then answer Job and say :     will one who argue with the Almighty be correct ?   let he who would instruct God give answer !      then Job answer the   Lord   and say :      look , I be of little account ; what can I answer you ?   I put my hand over my mouth .   I have speak once , I will not reply ;   twice , but I will do so no more .     then the   Lord   answer Job out of the storm and say :     Gird up your loin now , like a man .   I will question you , and you tell I the answer !    would you refuse to acknowledge my right ?   would you condemn I that you may be justify ?   have you an arm like that of God ,   or can you thunder with a voice like his ?   adorn yourself with grandeur and majesty ,   and clothe yourself with glory and splendor .   let loose the fury of your wrath ;   look at everyone who be proud and bring they down .   look at everyone who be proud , and humble they .   tear down the wicked in their place ,    bury they in the dust together ;   in the hide world imprison they .   then will I too praise you ,   for your own right hand can save you .   look at Behemoth ,    whom I make along with you ,   who feed on grass like an ox .   see the strength in his loin ,   the power in the sinew of his belly .   he carry his tail like a cedar ;   the sinew of his thigh be like cable .   his bone be like tube of bronze ;   his limb be like iron rod .   he be the first of Gods way ,   only his maker can approach he with a sword .   for the mountain bring he produce ,   and all wild animal make sport there .   under lotus tree he lie ,   in covert of the reedy swamp .   the lotus tree cover he with their shade ;   all about he be the poplar in the wadi .   if the river grow violent , he be not disturbed ;   he be tranquil though the Jordan surge about his mouth .   who can capture he by his eye ,   or pierce his nose    with a trap ?   can you lead Leviathan    about with a hook ,   or tie down his tongue with a rope ?   can you put a ring into his nose ,   or pierce through his cheek with a gaff ?   will he then plead with you , time after time ,   or address you with tender word ?   will he make a covenant with you   that you may have he as a slave forever ?   can you play with he , as with a bird ?   can you tie he up for your little girl ?   will the trader bargain for he ?   will the merchant    divide he up ?   can you fill his hide with barb ,   or his head with fish spear ?   once you but lie a hand upon he ,   no need to recall any other conflict !
