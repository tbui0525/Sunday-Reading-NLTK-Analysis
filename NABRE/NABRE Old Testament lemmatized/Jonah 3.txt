b '   Jonahs obedience and the Ninevites Repentance .     the word of the   Lord   come to Jonah a second time :      set out for the great city of Nineveh , and announce to it the message that I will tell you .      so Jonah set out for Nineveh , in accord with the word of the   Lord . now Nineveh be an awesomely great city ; it take three day to walk through it .      Jonah begin his journey through the city , and when he have go only a single day walk announce , forty day more and Nineveh shall be overthrow ,      the people of Nineveh believe God ; they proclaim a fast and all of they , great and small ,    put on sackcloth .      when the news reach the king of Nineveh , he rise from his throne , lay aside his robe , cover himself with sackcloth , and sit in ashe .      then he have this proclaim throughout Nineveh :    by decree of the king and his noble , no man or beast , no cattle or sheep , shall taste anything ; they shall not eat , nor shall they drink water .      Man and beast alike must be cover with sackcloth and call loudly to God ; they all must turn from their evil way and from the violence of their hand .       who know ? God may again repent and turn from his blaze wrath , so that we will not perish .        when God see by their action how they turn from their evil way , he repent of the evil he have threaten to do to they ; he do not carry it out .
