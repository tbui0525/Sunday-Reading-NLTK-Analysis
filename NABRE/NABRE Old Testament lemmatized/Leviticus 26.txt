b '   the Reward of obedience .      do not make idol for yourself . you shall not erect a carve image or a sacred stone for yourself , nor shall you set up a carve stone for worship in your land ;    for I , the   Lord , be your God .      keep my sabbath ,    and reverence my sanctuary . I be the   Lord .       if you live in accordance with my statute and be careful to observe my commandment ,      I will give you your rain in due season , so that the land will yield its crop , and the tree their fruit ;        your threshing will last till vintage time , and your vintage till the time for sow , and you will eat your fill of food , and live securely in your land .        I will establish peace in the land , and you will lie down to rest with no one to cause you anxiety . I will rid the country of ravenous beast , and no sword shall sweep across your land .      you will rout your enemy , and they shall fall before your sword .      five of you will put a hundred of your foe to flight , and a hundred of you will put to flight ten thousand , till your enemy fall before your sword .        I will look with favor upon you , and make you fruitful and numerous ,    as I carry out my covenant with you .      you shall eat the old store harvest , and have to discard it to make room for the new .         I will set my tabernacle in your midst , and will not loathe you .      ever present in your midst , I will be your God , and you will be my people ;      I , the   Lord , be your God , who bring you out of the land of Egypt to be their slave no more , break the bar of your yoke and make you walk erect .   the punishment of Disobedience .         but if you do not heed I and do not keep all these commandment ,      if you reject my statute and loathe my decree , refuse to obey all my commandment and break my covenant ,      then I , in turn , will do this to you : I will bring terror upon you\xe2\x80\x94with consumption and fever to dim the eye and sap the life . you will sow your seed in vain , for your enemy will consume the crop .      I will turn against you , and you will be beat down before your enemy    and your foe will lord it over you . you will flee though no one pursue you .     if even after this you do not obey I , I will increase the chastisement for your sin sevenfold ,        to break your proud strength . I will make the sky above you as hard as iron , and your soil as hard as bronze ,      so that your strength will be spend in vain ; your land will bear no crop , and its tree no fruit .     if then you continue hostile , unwilling to obey I , I will multiply my blow sevenfold , as your sin deserve .      I will unleash wild beast against you , to rob you of your child and wipe out your livestock , till your population dwindle away and your road become deserted .     if , with all this , you still do not accept my discipline and continue hostile to I ,       I , too , will continue to be hostile to you and I , for my part , will smite you for your sin sevenfold .      I will bring against you the sword , the avenger of my covenant . though you then huddle together in your city , I will send pestilence among you , till you be deliver to the enemy .      when I break your staff of bread , ten woman will need but one oven for bake your bread , and they shall dole it out to you by weight ;    and though you eat , you shall not be satisfied .     if , despite all this , you disobey and continue hostile to I ,      I will continue in my hostile rage toward you , and I myself will discipline you for your sin sevenfold ,      till you begin to eat the flesh of your own son and daughter .        I will demolish your high place , overthrow your incense stand , and cast your corpse upon the corpse of your idol .    in my loathing of you ,      I will lay waste your city and desolate your sanctuary , refuse your sweet - smell offering .      so devastated will I leave the land that your enemy who come to live there will stand aghast at the sight of it .        and you I will scatter among the nation    at the point of my drawn sword , leave your countryside desolate and your city desert .      then shall the land , during the time it lie waste , make up its lose sabbath , while you be in the land of your enemy ; then shall the land have rest and make up for its sabbath        during all the time that it lie desolate , enjoy the rest that you would not let it have on your sabbath when you live there .     those of you who survive in the land of their enemy , I will make so fainthearted that the sound of a drive leaf will pursue they , and they shall run as if from the sword , and fall though no one pursue they ;      stumble over one another as if to escape a sword , while no one be after them\xe2\x80\x94so helpless will you be to take a stand against your foe !      you shall perish among the nation , swallow up in your enemy country .      those of you who survive will waste away in the land of their enemy , for their own and their ancestor guilt .       they will confess    their iniquity and the iniquity of their ancestor in their treachery against I and in their continue hostility toward I ,      so that I , too , have to be hostile to they and bring they into their enemy land . then , when their uncircumcised heart be humble and they make amend for their iniquity ,      I will remember my covenant with Jacob , and also my covenant with Isaac ; and also my covenant with Abraham I will remember .    the land , too , I will remember .      the land will be forsake by they , that in its desolation without they , it may make up its sabbath , and that they , too , may make good the debt of their guilt for having spurn my decree and loathe my statute .      yet even so , even while they be in their enemy land , I will not reject or loathe they to the point of wipe they out , thus make void my covenant with they ; for I , the   Lord , be their God .      I will remember for they the covenant I make with their forebear , whom I bring out of the land of Egypt before the eye of the nation ,    that I might be their God . I be the   Lord .     these be the statute , decree and law which the   Lord   establish between himself and the Israelites through Moses on Mount Sinai .              '
