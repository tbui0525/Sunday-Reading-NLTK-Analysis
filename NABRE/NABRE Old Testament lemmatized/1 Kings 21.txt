b '   seizure of Naboths Vineyard .      Naboth the Jezreelite have a vineyard in Jezreel next to the palace of Ahab , king of Samaria . some time later ,      Ahab say to Naboth , give I your vineyard to be my vegetable garden , since it be close by , next to my house . I will give you a well vineyard in exchange , or , if you prefer , I will give you its value in money .      Naboth say to Ahab , the   Lord   forbid that I should give you my ancestral heritage .        Ahab go home disturbed and angry at the answer Naboth the Jezreelite have give he : I will not give you my ancestral heritage . lie down on his bed , he turn away and would not eat .      his wife Jezebel come to he and say to he , why be you so sullen that you will not eat ?      he answer she , because I speak to Naboth the Jezreelite and say to he , sell I your vineyard , or , if you prefer , I will give you a vineyard in exchange . but he say , I will not give you my vineyard .      Jezebel his wife say to he , what a king of Israel you be ! get up ! eat and be cheerful . I will give you the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite .     so she write letter in Ahabs name and , having seal they with his seal , send they to the elder and to the noble who live in the same city with Naboth .      this be what she write in the letter : proclaim a fast and set Naboth at the head of the people .      next , set two scoundrel opposite he to accuse he : you have curse God and king . then take he out and stone he to death .     his fellow citizens\xe2\x80\x94the elder and the noble who dwelt in his city\xe2\x80\x94did as Jezebel have order in the letter she send they .      they proclaim a fast and set Naboth at the head of the people .      two scoundrel come in and sit opposite Naboth , and the scoundrel accuse he in the presence of the people , Naboth have curse God and king . and they lead he out of the city and stone he to death .      then they send word to Jezebel : Naboth have be stone to death .     when Jezebel learn that Naboth have be stone to death , she say to Ahab , go , take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite which he refuse to sell you , because Naboth be not alive , but dead .      when Ahab hear that Naboth be dead , he start on his way down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite , to take possession of it .    Prophetic Condemnation .     then the word of the   Lord   come to Elijah the Tishbite :      go down to meet Ahab , king of Israel , who be in Samaria . he will be in the vineyard of Naboth , where he have go to take possession .       tell he : thus say the   Lord : after murder , do you also take possession ? and tell he , thus say the   Lord : in the place where the dog lick up the blood of Naboth , the dog shall lick up your blood , too .      Ahab say to Elijah , have you find I out , my enemy ? he say , I have find you . because you have give yourself up to do evil in the   Lord s sight ,       I be bring evil upon you : I will consume you and will cut off every male belong to Ahab , whether bond or free , in Israel .      I will make your house like that of Jeroboam , son of Nebat , and like the house of Baasha , son of Ahijah , because you have provoke I by lead Israel into sin .     against Jezebel , too , the   Lord   declare : the dog shall devour Jezebel in the confine of Jezreel .     anyone of Ahabs line who die in the city ,   dog will devour ; anyone who die in the field ,   the bird of the sky will devour .     indeed , no one give himself up to the doing of evil in the sight of the   Lord   as do Ahab , urge on by his wife Jezebel .      he become completely abominable by go after idol , just as the Amorites have do , whom the   Lord   drive out of the Israelites way .     when Ahab hear these word , he tear his garment and put on sackcloth over his bare flesh . he fast , sleep in the sackcloth , and go about subdued .      then the word of the   Lord   come to Elijah the Tishbite ,       have you see how Ahab have humble himself before I ? since he have humble himself before I , I will not bring the evil in his time . I will bring the evil upon his house in his son time .             '
