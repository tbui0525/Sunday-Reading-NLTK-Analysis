b ' God the Vindicator   a plaintive song of David , which he sing to the   Lord   concern Cush , the Benjaminite .    I   Lord   my God , in you I trust ;   save I ; rescue I from all who pursue I ,    lest someone maul I like a lion ,   tear my soul apart with no one to deliver .    II   Lord   my God , if I have do this ,    if there be guilt on my hand ,   if I have maltreat someone treat I equitably\xe2\x80\x94   or even despoiled my oppressor without cause\xe2\x80\x94   then let my enemy pursue and overtake my soul ,   trample my life to the ground ,   and lie my honor in the dust .   Selah    III   rise up ,   Lord , in your anger ;   be arouse against the outrage of my oppressor .    stir up the justice , my God , you have command .   have the assembly of the people gather about you ;   and return on high above they ,    the   Lord   will pass judgment on the people . Judge I ,   Lord , accord to my righteousness ,   and my integrity .   let the malice of the wicked end .   uphold the just one ,   o just God ,    who try heart and mind .    IV   God be a shield above I   save the upright of heart .    God be a just judge , powerful and patient ,    not exercise anger every day .   if one do not repent ,   God sharpen his sword ,   string and ready the bow ,    prepare his deadly shaft ,   make arrow blaze thunderbolt .     v   consider how one conceive iniquity ;   be pregnant with mischief ,   and give birth to deception .    he dig a hole and bore it deep ,   but he fall into the pit he have make .    his malice turn back upon his head ;   his violence fall on his own skull .    VI   I will thank the   Lord   in accordance with his justice ;   I will sing the name of the   Lord   most high .              '
