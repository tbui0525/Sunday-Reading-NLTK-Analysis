b ' Confident Prayer for Deliverance   for the director . do not destroy .    a   miktam   of David , when he flee from Saul into a cave .     I   have mercy on I , God ,   have mercy on I .   in you I seek refuge . in the shadow of your wing    I seek refuge   till harm pass by .    I call to God most High ,   to God who provide for I .   may God send help from heaven to save I ,   shame those who trample upon I .   may God send fidelity and mercy . Selah   I must lie down in the midst of lion   hungry for human prey .   their tooth be spear and arrow ;   their tongue , a sharpen sword .    be exalt over the heaven , God ;   may your glory appear above all the earth .     II   they have set a trap for my foot ;   my soul be bow down ; they have dig a pit before I .   may they fall into it themselves !   Selah   my heart be steadfast , God ,   my heart be steadfast .   I will sing and chant praise .    Awake , my soul ;   awake , lyre and harp !   I will wake the dawn .     I will praise you among the people , Lord ;   I will chant your praise among the nation .    for your mercy tower to the heavens ;   your faithfulness reach to the sky .    exalt yourself over the heavens , God ;   may your glory appear above all the earth .
