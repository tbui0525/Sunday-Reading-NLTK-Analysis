b ' the all - know and ever - present God   for the leader . a psalm of David . I Lord , you have probe I , you know I :    you know when I sit and stand ;     you understand my thought from afar .   you sift through my travel and my rest ;   with all my way you be familiar .   even before a word be on my tongue ,   Lord , you know it all .   behind and before you encircle I   and rest your hand upon I .   such knowledge be too wonderful for I ,   far too lofty for I to reach .      where can I go from your spirit ?   from your presence , where can I flee ?   if I ascend to the heaven , you be there ;   if I lie down in Sheol , there you be .    if I take the wing of dawn    and dwell beyond the sea ,   even there your hand guide I ,   your right hand hold I fast .   if I say , surely darkness shall hide I ,   and night shall be my light   \xe2\x80\x94   darkness be not dark for you ,   and night shine as the day .   darkness and light be but one .     II   you form my inmost be ;   you knit I in my mother womb .    I praise you , because I be wonderfully make ;   wonderful be your work !   my very self you know .   my bone be not hide from you , when I be be make in secret ,   fashion in the depth of the earth .    your eye see I unformed ;   in your book all be write down ;    my day be shape , before one come to be .    III   how precious to I be your design , o God ;   how vast the sum of they !   be I to count they , they would outnumber the sand ;   when I complete they , still you be with I .    when you would destroy the wicked , o God ,   the bloodthirsty depart from I !    your foe who conspire a plot against you   be exalt in vain .    IV   do I not hate ,   Lord , those who hate you ?   those who rise against you , do I not loathe ?    with fierce hatred I hate they ,   enemy I count as my own .     probe I , God , know my heart ;   try I , know my thought .    see if there be a wicked path in I ;   lead I along an ancient path .
