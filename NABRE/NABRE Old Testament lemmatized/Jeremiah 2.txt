b '   Infidelity of Israel .      the word of the   Lord   come to I :      go , cry out this message for Jerusalem to hear ! I remember the devotion    of your youth ,   how you love I as a bride , follow I in the wilderness ,   in a land unsown .    Israel be dedicate to the   Lord ,   the first fruit    of his harvest ; all who eat of it be hold guilty ,   evil befall them\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord .    listen to the word of the   Lord , house of Jacob !   all you clan of the house of Israel ,    thus say the   Lord : what fault do your ancestor find in I   that they withdraw from I , go after emptiness ,   and become empty themselves ?    they do not ask , where be the   Lord   who bring we up from the land of Egypt , who lead we through the wilderness ,   through a land of waste and ravine , a land of drought and darkness ,   a land which no one cross ,   where no one dwell ?    I bring you into the garden land   to eat its fine fruit , but you enter and defile my land ,   you turn my heritage into an abomination .    the priest do not ask ,   where be the   Lord ? the expert in the law    do not know I :   the shepherd rebel against I . the prophet prophesy by Baal ,   and go after useless idol .    therefore I will again accuse you\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord \xe2\x80\x94   even your children child I will accuse .    Cross to the coast of Cyprus and see ,   send to Kedar    and carefully inquire :   where have anything like this be do ?   do any other nation change its gods?\xe2\x80\x94   even though they be not god at all ! but my people have change their glory   for useless thing .    be horrified at this , heavens ;   shudder , be appalled\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord .   two evil my people have do :   they have forsake I , the source of living water ; they have dig themselves cistern ,   break cistern that can not hold water .    be Israel a slave , a house - bear servant ?    why then have he become plunder ?   against he lion roar ,   they raise their voice . they have turn his land into a waste ;   his city be charred ruin , without an inhabitant .    yes , the people of Memphis    and Tahpanhes   shave the crown of your head .   have not forsake the   Lord , your God ,   do this to you ?    and now , why go to Egypt ,    to drink the water of the Nile ? why go to Assyria ,   to drink the water of the River ?   your own wickedness chastise you ,   your own infidelity punish you . know then , and see , how evil and bitter   be your forsake the   Lord , your God , and your show no fear of I ,   oracle of the Lord , the   God   of host .    long ago you break your yoke ,    you tear off your bond .   you say , I will not serve . on every high hill , under every green tree ,   you sprawl and serve as a prostitute .    but I have plant you as a choice vine ,   all pedigreed stock ; how could you turn out so obnoxious to I ,   a spurious vine ?    even if you scour it with lye ,   and use much soap , the stain of your guilt be still before I ,   oracle of the Lord   God .    how can you say , I be not defile ,   I have not pursue the baal ? consider your conduct in the Valley ,    recall what you have do : a skittish young camel ,   run back and forth ,    a wild donkey breed in the wilderness , sniff the wind in her desire\xe2\x80\x94   who can restrain her lust ? none seek she need tire themselves ;   in her time they will find she .   stop wear out your foot   and parch your throat ! but you say , no use ! no !   how I love these stranger ,   after they I must go .    as the thief be shame when catch ,   so shall the house of Israel be shame : they , their king , their prince ,   their priest and their prophet ;    they say to a piece of wood , you be my father ,   and to a stone , you give I birth . they turn their back to I , not their face ;   yet in their time of trouble they cry out ,   rise up and save we !   where be the god you make for yourself ?   let they rise up !   will they save you in your time of trouble ? for as numerous as your city   be your god , o Judah ! and as many as the street of Jerusalem   be the altar you have set up for Baal .    why be you argue with I ?   you have all rebel against me\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord .   in vain I strike your child ;   correction they do not take . your sword devour your prophet   like a ravening lion .    you people of this generation ,   consider the word of the Lord : have I become a wilderness to Israel ,   a land of gloom ? why then do my people say , we have move on ,   we will not come to you any more ?   do a young woman forget her jewelry ,   a bride her sash ? yet my people have forget I   day without number .    how well you pick your way   when seek love ! in your wickedness ,   you have go by way unclean !   on your clothing be   the life - blood of the innocent ,   you do not find they commit burglary ;   nonetheless you say , I be innocent ;   at least , his anger be turn away from I . listen ! I will judge you   on that word of your , I have not sin .   how frivolous you have become   in change your course ! by Egypt you will be shame ,   just as you be shame by Assyria .    from there too you will go out ,   your hand upon your head ; for the   Lord   have reject those in whom you trust ,   with they you will have no success .
