b '    as when brushwood be set ablaze ,   or fire make the water boil ! then your name would be make known to your enemy   and the nation would tremble before you ,   while you work awesome deed we could not hope for ,     such as have not be hear of from of old . no ear have ever hear , no eye ever see ,   any God but you   work such deed for those who wait for he .    would that you might meet we do right ,   that we might be mindful of you in our way ! indeed , you be angry ; we have sin ,   we have act wickedly .   we have all become like something unclean ,   all our just deed be like polluted rag ; we have all wither like leave ,   and our crime carry we away like the wind .    there be none who call upon your name ,   none who rouse themselves to take hold of you ; for you have hide your face from we   and have deliver we up to our crime .    a Final Plea    yet ,   Lord , you be our father ;   we be the clay and you our potter :   we be all the work of your hand .   do not be so very angry ,   Lord ,   do not remember our crime forever ;   look upon we , who be all your people !   your holy city have become a wilderness ;   Zion have become wilderness , Jerusalem desolation !    our holy and glorious house   in which our ancestor praise you have be burn with fire ;   all that be dear to we be lay waste .   can you hold back ,   Lord , after all this ?   can you remain silent , and afflict we so severely ?
