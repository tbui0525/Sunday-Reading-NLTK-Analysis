b '       hear , then , what the   Lord   say : Arise , plead your case before the mountain ,   and let the hill hear your voice !    hear , o mountain , the   Lord s case ,   pay attention , o foundation of the earth ! for the   Lord   have a case against his people ;   he enter into trial with Israel .   my people , what have I do to you ?   how have I weary you ? answer I !    I bring you up from the land of Egypt ,   from the place of slavery I ransom you ; and I send before you Moses ,   Aaron , and Miriam .     my people , remember what Moabs King Balak plan ,   and how Balaam , the son of Beor , answer he . recall the passage from Shittim to Gilgal ,   that you may know the just deed of the   Lord .     with what shall I come before the   Lord ,   and bow before God most high ? shall I come before he with burn offering ,   with calf a year old ?    will the   Lord   be pleased with thousand of ram ,   with myriad stream of oil ?    shall I give my firstborn for my crime ,   the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul ?    you have be tell , o mortal , what be good ,   and what the   Lord   require of you : only to do justice and to love goodness ,   and to walk humbly with your God .     the   Lord   cry aloud to the city   ( it be prudent to fear your name ! ):   hear , o tribe and city assembly ,   be I to bear criminal hoarding   and the accursed short ephah ?    shall I acquit crooked scale ,   bag of false weight ?   you whose wealthy be full of violence ,   whose inhabitant speak falsehood   with deceitful tongue in their mouth !   I have begin to strike you   with devastation because of your sin .   you shall eat , without be satisfied ,   food that will leave you empty ; what you acquire , you can not save ;   what you do save , I will deliver up to the sword .    you shall sow , yet not reap ,   tread out the olive , yet pour no oil ,   crush the grape , yet drink no wine .    you have keep the decree of Omri ,   and all the work of the house of Ahab ,   and you have walk in their counsel ; therefore I will deliver you up to ruin ,   and your citizen to derision ;   and you shall bear the reproach of the nation .
