Hezekiah , however , do not respond with like generosity , for he have become arrogant . therefore wrath descend upon he and upon Judah and Jerusalem .       but then Hezekiah humble himself for his pride\xe2\x80\x94both he and the inhabitant of Jerusalem ; and therefore the wrath of the   Lord   do not come upon they during the time of Hezekiah .      Hezekiah possess very great wealth and glory . he make treasury for his silver , gold , precious stone , spice , jewel , and other precious thing of all kind ;      also storehouse for the harvest of grain , for wine and oil , and barn for the various kind of cattle and flock .      he build city for himself , and he acquire sheep and oxen in great number , for God give he very great rich .      this same Hezekiah stop the upper outlet for water from Gihon and redirect it underground westward to the City of David .
