b '   to keep the law be to make many offering ;     whoever observe the commandment sacrifice a peace offering .   by work of charity one offer fine flour ,     and one who give alm present a sacrifice of praise .   to refrain from evil please the Lord ,   and to avoid injustice be atonement .     do not appear before the Lord empty - handed ,    for all that you offer be in fulfillment of the precept .    the offering of the just enrich the altar :   a sweet odor before the most high .   the sacrifice of the just be accept ,   never to be forget .   with a generous spirit pay homage to the Lord ,   and do not spare your freewill gift .    with each contribution show a cheerful countenance ,   and pay your tithe in a spirit of joy .    give to the most high as he have give to you ,   generously , accord to your mean .   for he be a God who always repay   and will give back to you sevenfold .      but offer no bribe ; these he do not accept !    do not trust in sacrifice of the fruit of extortion ,   for he be a God of justice ,   who show no partiality .    he show no partiality to the weak   but hear the grievance of the oppressed .    he do not forsake the cry of the orphan ,    nor the widow when she pour out her complaint .   do not the tear that stream down her cheek    cry out against the one that cause they to fall ?   those who serve God to please he be accept ;   their petition reach the cloud .   the prayer of the lowly pierce the cloud ;   it do not rest till it reach its goal ; nor will it withdraw till the most High respond ,    judge justly and affirm the right .     God indeed will not delay ,   and like a warrior , will not be still   till he break the back of the merciless    and wreak vengeance upon the nation ; till he destroy the scepter of the proud ,   and cut off the staff of the wicked ;   till he requite everyone accord to their deed ,   and repay they accord to their thought ;   till he defend the cause of his people ,   and make they glad by his salvation .   Welcome be his mercy in time of distress   as rain cloud in time of drought .             '
