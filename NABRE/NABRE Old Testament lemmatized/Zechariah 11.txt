b '   the Cry of Trees , Shepherds , and lion   open your door , Lebanon ,   that fire may devour your cedar !   Wail , cypress tree ,   for the cedar be fall ,   the mighty be destroy ! Wail , oak of Bashan ,   for the dense forest be cut down !   listen ! the wailing of shepherd ,   their glory have be destroy . listen ! the roaring of young lion ,   the thicket of the Jordan be destroy . the Shepherd Narrative .         thus say the   Lord , my God : Shepherd the flock to be slaughter .        for they who buy they slay they and be not hold accountable ; while those who sell they say , bless be the   Lord , I have become rich ! even their own shepherd will not pity they .      for I will no long pity the inhabitant of the earth\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord .\xe2\x80\x94Yes , I will deliver they into each other power , or into the power of their king ; they will crush the earth , and I will not deliver it out of their power .     so I shepherd the flock to be slaughter for the merchant of the flock . I take two staff : one I call Delight , and the other Union . thus I shepherd the flock .      in a single month , I do away with the three shepherd , for I weary of they , and they disdain I .      I will not shepherd you , I say . whoever be to die shall die ; whoever be to be do away with shall be do away with ; and those who be leave shall devour one another flesh .     then I take my staff Delight and snap it in two , break my covenant which I have make with all people .      so it be break on that day . the merchant of the flock , who be watch I , understand that this be the word of the   Lord .      then I say to they , if it seem good to you , give I my wage ; but if not , withhold they .    and they count out my wage ,    thirty piece of silver .      then the   Lord   say to I , throw it in the treasury\xe2\x80\x94the handsome price at which they value I . so I take the thirty piece of silver and throw they into the treasury in the house of the   Lord .      then I snap in two my second staff , Union , break the kinship between Judah and Israel .     the   Lord   say to I : this time take the gear of a foolish shepherd .        for I be raise up a shepherd in the land who will take no note of those that disappear , nor seek the stray , nor heal the injure ,    nor feed the exhausted ; but he will eat the flesh of the fat one and tear off their hoof !    Oracle to the worthless Shepherd   Ah ! my worthless shepherd   who forsake the flock !   may the sword fall upon his arm   and upon his right eye ; his arm will surely wither ,   and his right eye surely go blind !
