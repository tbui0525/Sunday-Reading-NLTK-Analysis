b '    then Elihu answer and say :      hear my discourse , you that be wise ;   you that have knowledge , listen to I !   for the ear test word ,   as the palate taste food .    let we choose what be right ;   let we determine among ourselves what be good .   for Job have say , I be innocent ,   but God have take away what be my right .    I declare the judgment on I to be a lie ;   my arrow - wound be incurable , sinless though I be .    what man be like Job ?   he drink in blasphemy like water ,   keep company with evildoer   and go along with the wicked ,   when he say , there be no profit   in pleasing God .    therefore , you that have understanding , hear I :   far be it from God to do wickedness ;   far from the Almighty to do wrong !    rather , he requite mortal for their conduct ,   and bring home to they their way of life .    surely , God can not act wickedly ,   the Almighty can not pervert justice .    who give he charge over the earth ,   or who set all the world in its place ?    if he be to set his mind to it ,   gather to himself his spirit and breath ,   all flesh would perish together ,   and mortal return to dust .    now you   \xe2\x80\x94understand , hear this !   listen to the word I speak !   can an enemy of justice be in control ,   will you condemn the supreme Just one ,   who say to a king , you be worthless !   and to noble , you be wicked !   who neither favor the person of prince ,   nor respect the rich more than the poor ? for they be all the work of his hand ;     in a moment they die , even at midnight .   People be shake , and pass away ,   the powerful be remove without lift a hand ;   for his eye be upon our way ,   and all our step he see .   there be no darkness so dense   that evildoer can hide in it .   for no one have God set a time   to come before he in judgment .   without inquiry he shatter the mighty ,    and appoint other in their place ,   thus he discern their work ;   overnight they be crush .    where the wicked be , he strike they ,   in a place where all can see ,   because they turn away from he   and do not understand his way at all :   and make the cry of the poor reach he ,   so that he hear the cry of the afflict .   if he be silent , who then can condemn ?   if he hide his face , who then can behold he ,   whether nation or individual ?   let an impious man not rule ,   nor those who ensnare their people .   should anyone say to God ,   I accept my punishment ; I will offend no more ;   what I can not see , teach I :   if I have do wrong , I will do so no more ,   would you then say that God must punish ,   when you be disdainful ? it be you who must choose , not I ;   speak , therefore , what you know .   those who understand will say to I ,   all the wise who hear my view :   job speak without knowledge ,   his word make no sense .    let Job be test to the limit ,   since his answer be those of the impious ;   for he be add rebellion to his sin   by brush off our argument   and address many word to God .
