b '   when I would have restore the fortune of my people ,    when I would have heal Israel , the guilt of Ephraim be reveal ,   the wickedness of Samaria :   they practice falsehood . thief break in ,   bandit roam outside .   yet they do not call to mind   that I remember all their wickedness .   now their crime surround they ,   present to my sight .     Israels Domestic Politics    with their wickedness they make the king rejoice ,   the prince too , with their treacherous deed .   they be all adulterer ,    like a blaze oven , which the baker quits stoke ,   after the dough knead until its rise .   on the day of our king ,   they make the prince sick with poison wine ;   he extend his hand to the scoffer .   for they draw near in ambush   with their heart like an oven . all the night their anger sleep ;   in the morning it flare like a blaze fire .   they be all heat like oven ,   and consume their ruler . all their king have fall ;   none of they call upon I .    Israels Foreign Politics   Ephraim be mix with the nation ,    Ephraim be an unturned cake .   stranger have consume his strength ,   but he do not know it ;   Gray hair be strew on his head ,   but he take no notice of it .   the arrogance of Israel bear witness against he ;   yet they do not return to the   Lord , their God ,   nor seek he , despite all this .    Ephraim be like a dove ,   silly and senseless ; they call upon Egypt ,   they go to Assyria .   when they go I will spread my net around they ,   like bird in the air I will bring they down .    I will chastise they when I hear of their assembly .   Woe to they , for they have stray from I !   Ruin to they , for they have rebel against I ! though I wish to redeem they ,   they speak lie against I .   they have not cry to I from their heart   when they wail upon their bed ; for wheat and wine they lacerate themselves ;    they rebel against I .   though I train and strengthen their arm ,   yet they devise evil against I .   they have again become useless ,   they have be like a treacherous bow .   their prince shall fall by the sword   because of the insolence of their tongue ;   thus they shall be mock in the land of Egypt .
