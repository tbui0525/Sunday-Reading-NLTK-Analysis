I myself will turn against and cut off    that individual from among the people ; for in the giving of offspring to Molech , my sanctuary be defile    and my holy name be profane .      if the people of the land condone the giving of offspring to Molech , by fail to put the wrongdoer to death ,      I myself will turn against that individual and his or her family , and I will cut off from their people both the wrongdoer and all who follow this person by prostitute themselves with Molech .     should anyone turn to ghost and spirit and prostitute oneself with they ,    I will turn against that person and cut such a one off from among the people .      sanctify yourself , then , and be holy ; for I , the   Lord , your God ,    be holy .      be careful , therefore , to observe my statute .
