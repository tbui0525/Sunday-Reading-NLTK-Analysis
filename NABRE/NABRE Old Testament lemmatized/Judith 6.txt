b '    when the noise of the crowd surround the council have subside , Holofernes , the rank general of the assyrian force , say to Achior , in the presence of the whole throng of foreigner , of the Moabites , and of the ammonite mercenary :      who be you ,    Achior and the mercenary of Ephraim , to prophesy among we as you have do today , and to tell we not to fight against the people of Israel because their God shield they ? who be God beside Nebuchadnezzar ? he will send his force and destroy they from the face of the earth . their God will not save they ;        but we , the servant of Nebuchadnezzar , will strike they down with one blow , for they will be unable to withstand the force of our cavalry .      we will overwhelm they with it , and their mountain shall be drunk with their blood , and their plain fill with their corpse . not a trace of they shall survive our attack ; they will utterly perish . so say King Nebuchadnezzar , lord of all the earth . for he have speak , and his word will not be in vain .      as for you , Achior , you ammonite mercenary , for say these thing in a moment of perversity , you will not see my face after today , until I have take revenge on this people that come out of Egypt .      then at my return , the sword of my army or the spear of my attendant will pierce your side , and you will fall among their wound .      my servant will now conduct you to the hill country , and leave you at one of the city beside the pass .      you will not die until you be destroy together with they .      if you still harbor the hope that they will not be take , then there be no need for you to be downcast .    I have speak , and not one of my word will fail to be fulfil .     then Holofernes order the servant who be stand by in his tent to seize Achior , conduct he to Bethulia , and hand he over to the Israelites .      so the servant seize he and take he out of the camp into the plain . from the plain they lead he up into the hill country until they reach the spring below Bethulia .     when the man of the city see they , they seize their weapon and run out of the city to the top of the hill , and all the slinger keep they from come up by hurl stone at they .      so , take cover below the hill , they bind Achior and leave he lie at the foot of the hill ; then they return to their lord . Achior in Bethulia .        the Israelites come down from their city and find he , untie he , and bring he into Bethulia . they place he before the ruler of the city ,      who in those day be Uzziah ,    son of Micah of the tribe of Simeon , and Chabris , son of Gothoniel , and Charmis , son of Melchiel .        they then convene all the elder of the city , and all their young man , as well as the woman , gather in haste at the place of assembly . they place Achior in the center of the people , and Uzziah question he about what have happen .      he reply by give they an account of what be say in the council of Holofernes , and of all his own word among the assyrian ruler , and of all the boasting threat of Holofernes against the house of Israel .     at this the people fall prostrate and worship God ,    and they cry out :      Lord , God of heaven , look at their arrogance ! have mercy on our people in their abject state , and look with favor this day on the face of those who be consecrate to you .      then they reassure Achior and praise he highly .      Uzziah bring he from the place of assembly to his home , where he give a banquet for the elder . that whole night they call upon the God of Israel for help .             '
