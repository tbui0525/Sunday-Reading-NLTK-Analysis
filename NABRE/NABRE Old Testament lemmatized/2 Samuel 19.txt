I swear by the   Lord   that if you do not go out , not a single man will remain with you overnight , and this will be a far great disaster for you than any that have come upon you from your youth until now .      so the king get up and sit at the gate . when all the people be tell , the king be sit at the gate , they come into his presence . the Reconciliation .   now the Israelites have flee to their separate tent ,      but throughout the tribe of Israel all the people be argue among themselves , say to one another : the king deliver we from the grasp of our enemy , and it be he who rescue we from the grasp of the Philistines . now , he have flee the country before Absalom ,      but Absalom , whom we anoint over we , have die in battle . why , then , should you remain silent about restore the king to his palace ? when the talk of all Israel reach the king ,      David send word to the priest Zadok and Abiathar : say to the elder of Judah : why should you be last to restore the king to his palace ?      you be my brother , you be my bone and flesh . why should you be last to restore the king ?      also say to Amasa : be you not my bone and flesh ? may God do thus to I , and more , if you do not become commander of my army permanently in place of Joab .        he win the heart of the Judahites all together , and so they send a message to the king : return , with all your servant .

I be now eighty year old . can I distinguish between good and evil ? can your servant taste what he eat and drink , or still hear the voice of man and woman singer ? why should your servant be any further burden to my lord the king ?      in escort the king across the Jordan , your servant be do little enough ! why should the king give I this reward ?      please let your servant go back to die in my own city by the tomb of my father and mother . here be your servant Chimham . let he cross over with my lord the king . do for he whatever seem good to you .      then the king say to he , Chimham shall cross over with I , and for he I will do whatever seem good to you . and anything else you would like I to do for you , I will do .      then all the people cross over the Jordan but the king remain ; he kiss Barzillai and bid he farewell as he return to his own place .      finally the king cross over to Gilgal , accompany by Chimham .
