b '   the Dawning of Divine Glory for Zion    Arise ! Shine , for your light have come ,   the glory of the   Lord   have dawn upon you .    though darkness cover the earth ,   and thick cloud , the people , upon you the   Lord   will dawn ,   and over you his glory will be see .   nation shall walk by your light ,   king by the radiance of your dawning .     the Nations come to Zion   raise your eye and look about ;   they all gather and come to you\xe2\x80\x94 your son from afar ,   your daughter in the arm of their nurse .    then you shall see and be radiant ,   your heart shall throb and overflow . for the rich of the sea shall be pour out before you ,   the wealth of nation shall come to you .   Caravans of camel shall cover you ,   dromedary of Midian and Ephah ; all from Sheba shall come   bear gold and frankincense ,   and herald the praise of the   Lord .   all the flock of Kedar shall be gather for you ,   the ram of Nebaioth shall serve your need ; they will be acceptable offering on my altar ,   and I will glorify my glorious house .   who be these that fly along like a cloud ,   like dove to their cote ?   the vessel of the coastland be gather ,   with the ship of Tarshish in the lead , to bring your child from afar ,   their silver and gold with them\xe2\x80\x94 for the name of the   Lord , your God ,   for the Holy One of Israel who have glorify you .    Honor and Service for Zion    Foreigners shall rebuild your wall ,   their king shall minister to you ; though in my wrath I strike you ,   yet in my good will I have show you mercy .    your gate shall stand open constantly ;   day and night they shall not be close so that they may bring you the wealth of nation ,   with their king in the vanguard .    for the nation or kingdom that will not serve you shall perish ;   such nation shall be utterly destroy !    the glory of Lebanon shall come to you\xe2\x80\x94   the juniper , the fir , and the cypress all together\xe2\x80\x94 to bring beauty to my sanctuary ,   and glory to the place where I stand .    the child of your oppressor shall come ,   bow before you ; all those who despise you ,   shall bow low at your foot . they shall call you City of the   Lord ,   Zion of the Holy One of Israel .   no long forsake and hate ,   with no one pass through , now I will make you the pride of the age ,   a joy from generation to generation .   you shall suck the milk of nation ,   and be nurse at royal breast ; and you shall know that I , the   Lord , be your savior ,   your redeemer , the Mighty One of Jacob .   instead of bronze I will bring gold ,   instead of iron I will bring silver ; instead of wood , bronze ;   instead of stone , iron . I will appoint peace your governor ,   and justice your ruler .    no long shall violence be hear of in your land ,   or plunder and ruin within your border . you shall call your wall Salvation   and your gate praise .    Eternal Light for Zion    no long shall the sun   be your light by day , nor shall the brightness of the moon   give you light by night ; rather , the   Lord   will be your light forever ,   your God will be your glory .    no long will your sun set ,   or your moon wane ; for the   Lord   will be your light forever ,   and the day of your grieving will be over .   your people will all be just ;   for all time they will possess the land ; they be the shoot that I plant ,   the work of my hand , that I might be glorify .    the least one shall become a clan ,   the small , a mighty nation ; I , the   Lord , will swiftly accomplish   these thing when the time come .
