b '    when Sanballat , Tobiah , the Arabs , the Ammonites , and the Ashdodites hear that the restoration of the wall of Jerusalem be progressing\xe2\x80\x94for the gap be begin to be close up\xe2\x80\x94they become extremely angry .      they all plot together to come and fight against Jerusalem and to throw we into confusion .      we pray to our God and post a watch against they day and night for fear of what they might do .      meanwhile the Judahites be say : Slackened be the bearer strength ,   there be no end to the rubbish ; never will we be able   to rebuild the wall .     our enemy think , before they be aware of it or see we , we will come into their midst , kill they , and put an end to the work .     when the Jews who live near they have come to we from one place after another , and have tell we ten time over that they be about to attack we ,      I station guard down below , behind the wall , near the exposed point , assign they by family group with their sword , spear , and bow .      I make an inspection , then address these word to the noble , the magistrate , and the rest of the people : do not fear they ! keep in mind the   Lord , who be great and to be fear , and fight for your kindred , your son and daughter , your wife and your home .      when our enemy realize that we have be warn and that God have upset their plan , we all go back , each to our own task at the wall .      from that time on , however , only half my work force take a hand in the work , while the other half , arm with spear , buckler , bow , and breastplate , stand guard behind the whole house of Judah      as they rebuild the wall . the load carrier , too , be armed ; each work with one hand and hold a weapon with the other .      every builder , while work , have a sword tie at his side . a trumpeter stand beside I ,      for I have say to the noble , the magistrate , and the rest of the people : our work be scatter and extensive , and we be widely separate from one another along the wall ;      wherever you hear the trumpet sound , join we there ; our God will fight with we .      thus we go on with the work , half with spear in hand , from daybreak till the star come out .     at the same time I tell the people to spend the night inside Jerusalem , each with an attendant , so that they might serve as a guard by night and a work force by day .      neither I , nor my kindred , nor any of my attendant , nor any of the bodyguard that accompany I take off our clothe ; everyone keep a weapon at hand .
