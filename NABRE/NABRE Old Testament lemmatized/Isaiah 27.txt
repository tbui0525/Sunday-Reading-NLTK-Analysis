b '   the Judgment and Deliverance of Israel    on that day , the   Lord   will punish with his sword   that be cruel , great , and strong , Leviathan the flee serpent ,   Leviathan the coiled serpent ;   he will slay the dragon    in the sea .        on that day\xe2\x80\x94 the pleasant vineyard , sing about it !     I , the   Lord , be its keeper ,   I water it every moment ; lest anyone harm it ,   night and day I guard it .    I be not angry .   but if I be to find brier and thorn , in battle I would march against it ;   I would burn it all .    but if it hold fast to my refuge ,   it shall have peace with I ;    it shall have peace with I .     in day to come Jacob shall take root ,   Israel shall sprout and blossom ,   cover all the world with fruit .     be he smitten as his smiter be smite ?   be he slay as his slayer be slay ?   drive out and expel , he struggle against it ,   carry it off with his cruel wind on a day of storm .    this , then , shall be the expiation of Jacobs guilt ,   this the result of remove his sin : he shall pulverize all the stone of the altar   like piece of chalk ;   no asherahs or incense altar shall stand .   for the fortified city shall be desolate ,   an abandon pasture , a forsaken wilderness ; there calf shall graze , there they shall lie down ,   and consume its branch .   when its bough wither , they shall be break off ;   and woman shall come to kindle fire with they . for this be not an understand people ;   therefore their maker shall not spare they ;   their creator shall not be gracious to they .     on that day , the   Lord   shall beat out grain   from the channel of the Euphrates to the Wadi of Egypt ,   and you shall be glean    one by one , child of Israel .    on that day ,   a great trumpet shall blow ,   and the lose in the land of Assyria   and the outcast in the land of Egypt shall come and worship the   Lord   on the holy mountain , in Jerusalem .
