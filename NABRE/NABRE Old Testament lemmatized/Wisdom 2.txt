b '     for , not think rightly , they say among themselves :   brief and troubled be our lifetime ;    there be no remedy for our dying ,   nor be anyone know to have come back from Hades .   for by mere chance be we bear ,   and hereafter we shall be as though we have not be ; because the breath in our nostril be smoke ,   and reason a spark from the beating of our heart ,   and when this be quench , our body will be ashe   and our spirit will be pour abroad like empty air .    even our name will be forget in time ,   and no one will recall our deed . so our life will pass away like the trace of a cloud ,   and will be disperse like a mist pursue by the sun ray   and overpower by its heat .   for our lifetime be the passing of a shadow ;   and our dying can not be defer   because it be fix with a seal ; and no one return .    come , therefore , let we enjoy the good thing that be here ,   and make use of creation with youthful zest .    let we have our fill of costly wine and perfume ,   and let no springtime blossom pass we by ;    let we crown ourselves with rosebuds before they wither .   let no meadow be free from our wantonness ;   everywhere let we leave token of our merriment ,   for this be our portion , and this our lot .    let we oppress the righteous poor ;   let we neither spare the widow   nor revere the aged for hair grow white with time .    but let our strength be our norm of righteousness ;   for weakness prove itself useless .      let we lie in wait for the righteous one , because he be annoying to we ;   he oppose our action , Reproaches we for transgression of the law    and charge we with violation of our training .    he profess to have knowledge of God   and style himself a child of the   Lord .    to we he be the censure of our thought ;   merely to see he be a hardship for we ,    because his life be not like that of other ,   and different be his way .   he judge we debase ;   he hold aloof from our path as from thing impure . he call bl the destiny of the righteous   and boast that God be his Father .      let we see whether his word be true ;   let we find out what will happen to he in the end .    for if the righteous one be the son of God , God will help he   and deliver he from the hand of his foe .    with violence and torture let we put he to the test   that we may have proof of his gentleness   and try his patience .   let we condemn he to a shameful death ;   for accord to his own word , God will take care of he .      these be their thought , but they err ;   for their wickedness blind they ,     and they do not know the hidden counsel of God ;   neither do they count on a recompense for holiness   nor discern the innocent soul reward .    for God form we to be imperishable ;   the image of his own nature he make we .    but by the envy    of the devil , death enter the world ,   and they who be ally with he experience it .
