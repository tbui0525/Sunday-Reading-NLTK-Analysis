b '    Woe be I ! I be like the one who gather summer fruit ,   when the vine have be glean ; there be no cluster to eat ,   no early fig that I crave .   the faithful have vanish from the earth ,   no mortal be just ! they all lie in wait to shed blood ,   each one ensnare the other .    their hand succeed at evil ;   the prince make demand , the judge be buy for a price ,   the powerful speak as they please .    the good of they be like a bri ,   the most honest like a thorn hedge . the day announce by your sentinel !   your punishment have come ;   now be the time of your confusion .   put no faith in a friend ,   do not trust a companion ; with she who lie in your embrace   watch what you say .    for the son belittle his father ,   the daughter rise up against her mother , the daughter - in - law against her mother - in - law ,   and your enemy be member of your household .     IV . confidence in Gods Future   but as for I , I will look to the   Lord ,   I will wait for God my savior ;   my God will hear I !     do not rejoice over I , my enemy !    though I have fall , I will arise ;   though I sit in darkness , the   Lord   be my light .   I will endure the wrath of the   Lord   because I have sin against he , until he plead my case ,   and establish my right . he will bring I forth to the light ;   I will see his righteousness .   when my enemy see this ,   shame shall cover she : she who say to I ,   where be the   Lord , your God ? my eye shall see her downfall ;   now she will be trample    underfoot ,   like mud in the street .    it be the day for build your wall ;   on that day your boundary shall be enlarge .   it be the day when those from Assyria to Egypt   shall come to you , and from Tyre even to the River ,   from sea to sea , and from mountain to mountain ;    and the earth shall be a waste   because of its inhabitant ,   as a result of their deed .      Shepherd your people with your staff ,   the flock of your heritage , that live apart    in a woodland ,   in the midst of an orchard . let they feed in Bashan and Gilead ,   as in the day of old ;   as in the day when you come from the land of Egypt ,   show we wonderful sign .   the nation will see and will be put to shame ,   in spite of all their strength ; they will put their hand over their mouth ;   their ear will become deaf .   they will lick the dust like a snake ,   like crawl thing on the ground ; they will come quake from their stronghold ;   they will tremble in fear of you , the   Lord , our God .    who be a God like you , who remove guilt   and pardon sin for the remnant of his inheritance ; who do not persist in anger forever ,   but instead delight in mercy ,    and will again have compassion on we ,   tread underfoot our iniquity ? you will cast into the depth of the sea all our sin ;   you will show faithfulness to Jacob ,   and loyalty to Abraham , as you have swear to our ancestor   from day of old .
