b ' trust in God    of David . a   the   Lord   be my light and my salvation ;   whom should   fear ? the   Lord   be my lifes refuge ;   of whom should   be afraid ?   when evildoer come at I   to devour my flesh ,    these my enemy and foe   themselves stumble and fall .   though an army encamp against I ,   my heart do not fear ; though war be wage against I ,   even then do   trust .      one thing   ask of the   Lord ;   this   seek : to dwell in the   Lord s house   all the day of my life , to gaze on the   Lord s beauty ,   to visit his temple .    for God will hide I in his shelter   in time of trouble ,   he will conceal I in the cover of his tent ;   and set I high upon a rock .   even now my head be hold high   above my enemy on every side !   will offer in his tent   sacrifice with shout of joy ;    will sing and chant praise to the   Lord .    b    hear my voice ,   Lord , when   call ;   have mercy on I and answer I .   come , say my heart , seek his face ;    your face ,   Lord , do   seek !    do not hide your face from I ;   do not repel your servant in anger . you be my salvation ; do not cast I off ;   do not forsake I , God my savior !   even if my father and mother forsake I ,   the   Lord   will take I in .       Lord , show I your way ;   lead I on a level path   because of my enemy .    do not abandon I to the desire of my foe ;   malicious and lie witness have rise against I .    believe   shall see the   Lord s goodness   in the land of the living .     wait for the   Lord , take courage ;   be stouthearte , wait for the   Lord !
