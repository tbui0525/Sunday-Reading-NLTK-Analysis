b '    from Alexander to Antiochus .      after Alexander the Macedonian , Philips son , who come from the land of Kittim ,    have defeat Darius , king of the Persians and Medes , he become king in his place , having first rule in Greece .      he fight many battle , capture fortress , and put the king of the earth to death .      he advance to the end of the earth , gather plunder from many nation ; the earth fall silent before he , and his heart become proud and arrogant .      he collect a very strong army and win dominion over province , nation , and ruler , and they pay he tribute .     but after all this he take to his bed , realize that he be go to die .      so he summon his noble officer , who have be bring up with he from his youth , and divide his kingdom among they while he be still alive .      Alexander have reign twelve year    when he die .     so his officer take over his kingdom , each in his own territory ,      and after his death they all put on diadem ,    and so do their son after they for many year , multiply evil on the earth .     there spring from these a sinful offshoot , Antiochus Epiphanes , son of King Antiochus , once a hostage at Rome . he become king in the one hundred and thirty - seventh year    of the kingdom of the Greeks .    Lawless Jews .      in those day there appear in Israel transgressor of the law who seduce many , say : let we go and make a covenant with the Gentiles all around we ; since we separate from they , many evil have come upon we .      the proposal be agreeable ;      some from among the people promptly go to the king , and he authorize they to introduce the ordinance of the Gentiles .      thereupon they build a gymnasium    in Jerusalem accord to the gentile custom .      they disguise their circumcision and abandon the holy covenant ; they ally themselves with the Gentiles and sell themselves to wrongdoing .    Antiochus in Egypt .      when his kingdom seem secure , Antiochus undertake to become king of the land of Egypt and to rule over both kingdom .      he invade Egypt with a strong force , with chariot , elephant    and cavalry , and with a large fleet ,      to make war on Ptolemy ,    king of Egypt . Ptolemy be frightened at his presence and flee , and many be wound and fall dead .      the fortified city in the land of Egypt be capture , and Antiochus plunder the land of Egypt .    Robbery of the Temple .      after Antiochus have defeat Egypt in the one hundred and forty - third year ,    he return and go up against Israel and against Jerusalem with a strong force .      he insolently enter the sanctuary    and take away the golden altar , the lampstand for the light with all its utensil ,      the offering table , the cup and bowl , the golden censer , and the curtain . the cornice and the golden ornament on the facade of the temple\xe2\x80\x94he strip it all off .      and he take away the silver and gold and the precious vessel ; he also take all the hide treasure he could find .      take all this , he go back to his own country . he shed much blood and speak with great arrogance .     and there be great mourning throughout all Israel ,    and the ruler and the elder groan . young woman and man languish ,   and the beauty of the woman fade .   every bridegroom take up lamentation ,   while the bride sit in her chamber mourn ,   and the land quake on account of its inhabitant ,   and all the house of Jacob be clothe with shame .    Attack and Occupation .      two year later , the king send the Mysian commander    to the city of Judah , and he come to Jerusalem with a strong force .      he speak to they deceitfully in peaceful term , and they believe he . then he attack the city suddenly , in a great onslaught , and destroy many of the people in Israel .      he plunder the city and set fire to it , demolish its house and its surround wall .      and they take captive the woman and child , and seize the animal .      then they build up the City of David with a high , strong wall and strong tower , and it become their citadel .        there they instal a sinful race , transgressor of the law , who fortify themselves inside it .      they store up weapon and provision , deposit there the plunder they have collect from Jerusalem , and they become a great snare .     the citadel become an ambush against the sanctuary ,   and a wicked adversary to Israel at all time .   they shed innocent blood around the sanctuary ;   they defile the sanctuary .   because of they the inhabitant of Jerusalem flee away ,   she become the abode of stranger . she become a stranger to her own offspring ,   and her child forsook she .    her sanctuary become desolate as a wilderness ;   her feast be turn into mourning , her sabbath to shame ,   her honor to contempt .   as her glory have be , so great be her dishonor :   her exaltation be turn into mourning .    Religious Persecution .      then the king write to his whole kingdom that all should be one people ,      and abandon their particular custom . all the Gentiles conform to the command of the king ,      and many Israelites delight in his religion ; they sacrifice to idol and profane the sabbath .     the king send letter by messenger to Jerusalem and to the city of Judah , order they to follow custom foreign to their land ;      to prohibit burn offering , sacrifice , and libation in the sanctuary , to profane the sabbath and feast day ,      to desecrate the sanctuary and the sacred minister ,      to build pagan altar and temple and shrine , to sacrifice swine and unclean animal ,      to leave their son uncircumcised , and to defile themselves with every kind of impurity and abomination ;      so that they might forget the law and change all its ordinance .      whoever refuse to act accord to the command of the king be to be put to death .      in word such as these he write to his whole kingdom . he appoint inspector over all the people , and he order the city of Judah to offer sacrifice , each city in turn .      many of the people , those who abandon the law , join they and commit evil in the land .      they drive Israel into hiding , wherever place of refuge could be find .     on the fifteenth day of the month Kislev , in the year one hundred and forty - five ,    the king erect the desolating abomination upon the altar of burn offering , and in the surround city of Judah they build pagan altar .        they also burn incense at the door of house and in the street .      any scroll of the law    that they find they tear up and burn .      whoever be find with a scroll of the covenant , and whoever observe the law , be condemn to death by royal decree .      so they use their power against Israel , against those who be catch , each month , in the city .      on the twenty - fifth day of each month they sacrifice on the pagan altar that be over the altar of burn offering .      in keep with the decree , they put to death woman who have their child circumcise ,      and they hang their baby from their neck ; their family also and those who have circumcise they be kill .     but many in Israel be determine and resolve in their heart not to eat anything unclean ;      they prefer to die rather than to be defile with food or to profane the holy covenant ; and they do die .      and very great wrath come upon Israel .
