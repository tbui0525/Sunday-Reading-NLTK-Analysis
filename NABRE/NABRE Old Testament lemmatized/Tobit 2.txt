b '    thus under King Esarhaddon I return to my home , and my wife Anna and my son Tobiah be restore to I . then on our festival of Pentecost , the holy feast of Weeks ,    a fine dinner be prepared for I , and I recline to eat .        the table be set for I , and the dish place before I be many . so I say to my son Tobiah : Son , go out and bring in whatever poor person you find among our kindred exile here in Nineveh who may be a sincere worshiper of God to share this meal with I . indeed , son , I shall wait for you to come back .      Tobiah go out to look for some poor person among our kindred , but he come back and cry , Father ! I say to he , here I be , son . he answer , Father , one of our people have be murder ! he have be throw out into the market place , and there he lie strangle .      I spring to my foot , leave the dinner untouched , carry the dead man from the square , and put he in one of the room until sundown , so that I might bury he .      I return and wash    and in sorrow eat my food .        I remember the oracle pronounce by the prophet Amos against Bethel :   I will turn your feast into mourning ,   and all your song into dirge .     then I weep . at sunset I go out , dig a grave , and bury he .     my neighbor mock I , say : do he have no fear ? once before he be hunt , to be execute for this sort of deed , and he run away ; yet here he be again bury the dead !    Tobits Blindness .     that same night I wash and go into my courtyard , where I lie down to sleep beside the wall . because of the heat I leave my face uncover .      I do not know that sparrow be perch on the wall above I ; their warm dropping settle in my eye , cause white scale    on they . I go to doctor for a cure , but the more they apply ointment , the more my vision be obscure by the white scale , until I be totally blind . for four year I be unable to see , and all my kindred be distressed at my condition . ahiqar , however , take care of I for two year , until he leave for Elam .     at that time my wife Anna work for hire at weaving cloth , do the kind of work woman do .      when she deliver the material to her employer , they would pay she a wage . on the seventh day of the month of Dystrus ,    she finish the woven cloth and deliver it to her employer . they pay she the full salary and also give she a young goat for a meal .      on enter my house , the goat begin to bleat . so I call to my wife and say : where do this goat come from ? it be not steal , be it ? give it back to its owner ; we have no right to eat anything steal !       but she say to I , it be give to I as a bonus over and above my wage . yet I would not believe she and tell she to give it back to its owner . I flush with anger at she over this . so she retort : where be your charitable deed now ? where be your righteous act ? look ! all that have happen to you be well know !              '
