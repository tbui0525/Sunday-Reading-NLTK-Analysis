b ' A prayer for the King   of Solomon .    I   o God , give your judgment to the king ;   your justice to the king son ;    that he may govern your people with justice ,   your oppress with right judgment ,    that the mountain may yield their bounty for the people ,   and the hill great abundance ,    that he may defend the oppressed among the people ,   save the child of the poor and crush the oppressor .    II   may they fear you with the sun ,   and before the moon , through all generation .    may he be like rain come down upon the field ,   like shower water the earth ,    that abundance may flourish in his day ,   great bounty , till the moon be no more .    III    may he rule from sea to sea ,   from the river to the end of the earth .    may his foe kneel before he ,   his enemy lick the dust .    may the king of Tarshish and the island    bring tribute ,   the king of Sheba and Seba offer gift .    may all king bow before he ,   all nation serve he .    for he rescue the poor when they cry out ,   the oppressed who have no one to help .   he show pity to the needy and the poor    and save the life of the poor .   from extortion and violence he redeem they ,   for precious be their blood    in his sight .    IV   Long may he live , receive gold from Sheba ,   pray for without cease , bless day by day .    May wheat abound in the land ,   flourish even on the mountain height . may his fruit be like that of Lebanon ,   and flourish in the city like the grass of the land .    may his name be forever ;   as long as the sun , may his name endure .   may the tribe of the earth give blessing with his name ;    may all the nation regard he as favor .     bless be the   Lord   God , the God of Israel ,   who alone do wonderful deed .    bless be his glorious name forever ;   may he fill all the earth with his glory .   amen and amen .     the end of the psalm of David , son of Jesse .
