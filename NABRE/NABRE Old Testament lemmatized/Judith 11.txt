I will say nothing false to my lord    this night .      if you follow the word of your maidservant , God will successfully perform a deed through you , and my lord will not fail to achieve his design .        I swear by the life of Nebuchadnezzar , king of all the earth , and by the power of he who have send you to guide all live thing , that not only do human being serve he through you ; but even the wild animal , and the cattle , and the bird of the air , because of your strength , will live for Nebuchadnezzar and his whole house .        indeed , we have hear of your wisdom and cleverness .    the whole earth be aware that you above all other in the kingdom be able , rich in experience , and distinguish in military strategy .      as for Achiors speech in your council , we have hear it . when the man of Bethulia rescue he , he tell they all he have say to you .      so then , my lord and master , do not disregard his word , but bear it in mind , for it be true . indeed our people be not punish , nor do the sword prevail against they , except when they sin against their God .        but now their sin    have catch up with they , by which they will bring the wrath of their God upon they when they do wrong ; so that my lord will not be repulse and fail , but death will overtake they .      because their food have give out and all their water be run low , they have decide to kill their animal , and be determined to consume all the thing which God in his law have forbid they to eat .      they have decide that they would use the first fruit of grain and the tithe of wine and oil , which they have consecrate and reserve for the priest who minister in the presence of our God in jerusalem\xe2\x80\x94thing which the people should not so much as touch with their hand .        they have send messenger to Jerusalem to bring back permission from the senate , for even there people have do these thing .        on the very day when the response reach they and they act upon it , they will be hand over to you for destruction .     as soon as I , your servant , learn all this , I flee from they . God have send I to perform with you such deed as will astonish people throughout the whole earth who hear of they .      your servant be , indeed , a God - fear woman , serve the God of heaven night and day . now I will remain with you , my lord ; but each night your servant will go out into the valley and pray to God . he will tell I when they have commit their offense .      then I will come and let you know , so that you may march out with all your force , and not one of they will be able to withstand you .
