b '     then the   Lord    answer Job out of the storm and say :     who be this who darken counsel   with word of ignorance ?   Gird up your loin    now , like a man ;   I will question you , and you tell I the answer !    where be you when I found the earth ?   tell I , if you have understanding .   who determine its size ? surely you know ?   who stretch out the measure line for it ?   into what be its pedestal sink ,   and who lay its cornerstone ,   while the morning star sing together   and all the son of God    shout for joy ?   who shut within door the sea ,   when it burst forth from the womb ,    when I make the cloud its garment   and thick darkness its swaddle band ?   when I set limit for it   and fasten the bar of its door ,   and say : thus far shall you come but no far ,   and here shall your proud wave stop ?   have you ever in your lifetime command the morning   and show the dawn its place   for take hold of the end of the earth ,   till the wicked be shake from it ?   the earth be change as clay by the seal ,   and dye like a garment ;   but from the wicked their light be withhold ,   and the arm of pride be shatter .   have you enter into the source of the sea ,   or walk about on the bottom of the deep ?   have the gate of death be show to you ,   or have you see the gate of darkness ?   have you comprehend the breadth of the earth ?   tell I , if you know it all .   what be the way to the dwelling of light ,   and darkness\xe2\x80\x94where be its place ?   that you may take it to its territory   and know the path to its home ?   you know , because you be bear then ,   and the number of your day be great !    have you enter the storehouse of the snow ,   and see the storehouse of the hail   which I have reserve for time of distress ,   for a day of war and battle ?    what be the way to the parting of the wind ,   where the east wind spread over the earth ?   who have lay out a channel for the downpour   and a path for the thunderstorm   to bring rain to uninhabited land ,   the unpeopled wilderness ;   to drench the desolate wasteland   till the desert bloom with verdure ?   have the rain a father ?   who have beget the drop of dew ?   out of whose womb come the ice ,   and who give the hoarfrost its birth in the sky ,   when the water lie cover as though with stone   that hold captive the surface of the deep ?   have you tie cord to the Pleiades ,    or loosen the bond of Orion ?   can you bring forth the Mazzaroth in their season ,   or guide the Bear with her child ?   do you know the ordinance of the heaven ;   can you put into effect their plan on the earth ?   can you raise your voice to the cloud ,   for they to cover you with a deluge of water ?   can you send forth the lightning on their way ,   so that they say to you , here we be ?   who give wisdom to the ibis ,   and give the rooster    understanding ?   who count the cloud with wisdom ?   who tilt the water jar of heaven   so that the dust of earth be fuse into a mass   and its clod stick together ?   do you hunt the prey for the lion   or appease the hunger of young lion ,   while they crouch in their dens ,   or lie in ambush in the thicket ?   who provide nourishment for the raven   when its young cry out to God ,    wander about without food ?
