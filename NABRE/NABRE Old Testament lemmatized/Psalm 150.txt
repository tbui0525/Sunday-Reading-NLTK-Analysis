b ' Final Doxology   Hallelujah ! praise God in his holy sanctuary ;     give praise in the mighty dome of heaven .   give praise for his mighty deed ,    praise he for his great majesty .   give praise with blast upon the horn ,    praise he with harp and lyre .   give praise with tambourine and dance ,   praise he with string and pipe .    give praise with crash cymbal ,   praise he with sound cymbal .   let everything that have breath   give praise to the   Lord !   Hallelujah !             '
