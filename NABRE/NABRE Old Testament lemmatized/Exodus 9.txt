b '   fifth plague : the Pestilence .     then the   Lord   say to Moses : go to Pharaoh and tell he : thus say the   Lord , the God of the Hebrews : let my people go to serve I .      for if you refuse to let they go and persist in hold they ,      the hand of the   Lord   will strike your livestock in the field\xe2\x80\x94your horse , donkey , camel , herd and flocks\xe2\x80\x94with a very severe pestilence .      but the   Lord   will distinguish between the livestock of Israel and that of Egypt , so that nothing belong to the Israelites will die .      and the   Lord   set a definite time , say : tomorrow the   Lord   will do this in the land .      and on the next day the   Lord   do it . all the livestock of the Egyptians die ,    but not one animal belong to the Israelites die .      but although Pharaoh find upon inquiry that not even so much as one of the livestock of the Israelites have die , he remain obstinate and would not let the people go .    sixth plague : The Boils .     so the   Lord   say to Moses and Aaron : each of you take handfuls of soot from a kiln , and in the presence of Pharaoh let Moses scatter it toward the sky .      it will turn into fine dust over the whole land of Egypt and cause fester boil    on human being and beast alike throughout the land of Egypt .     so they take the soot from a kiln and appear before Pharaoh . when Moses scatter it toward the sky , it cause fester boil on human being and beast alike .      because of the boil the magician could not stand in Moses presence , for there be boil on the magician as well as on the rest of the Egyptians .      but the   Lord   harden Pharaohs heart , and he would not listen to they , just as the   Lord   have say to Moses .    seventh plague : the hail .     then the   Lord   speak to Moses : early tomorrow morning present yourself to Pharaoh and say to he : thus say the   Lord , the God of the Hebrews : let my people go to serve I ,      for this time I will unleash all my blow upon you and your servant and your people , so that you may know that there be none like I anywhere on earth .      for by now I should have stretch out my hand and strike you and your people with such pestilence that you would have vanish from the earth .      but this be why I have let you survive : to show you    my power and to make my name resound throughout the earth !        will you continue to exalt yourself over my people and not let they go ?      at this time tomorrow , therefore , I be go to rain down such fierce hail as there have never be in Egypt from the day it be found up to the present .      therefore , order your livestock and whatever else you have in the open field to be bring to a place of safety . whatever human being or animal be find in the field and be not bring to shelter will die when the hail come down upon they .      those of Pharaohs servant who fear the word of the   Lord   hurry their servant and their livestock off to shelter .      but those who do not pay attention to the word of the   Lord   leave their servant and their livestock in the field .     the   Lord   then say to Moses : stretch out your hand toward the sky , that hail may fall upon the entire land of Egypt , on human being and beast alike and all the vegetation of the field in the land of Egypt .      so Moses stretch out his staff toward the sky , and the   Lord   send forth peal of thunder and hail .    Lightning flash toward the earth , and the   Lord   rain down hail upon the land of Egypt .      there be hail and lightning flash here and there through the hail , and the hail be so fierce that nothing like it have be see in Egypt since it become a nation .      throughout the land of Egypt the hail strike down everything in the field , human being and beast alike ; it strike down all the vegetation of the field and splinter every tree in the field .      only in the land of Goshen , where the Israelites be , be there no hail .     then Pharaoh send for Moses and Aaron and say to they , I have sin this time ! the   Lord   be the just one , and I and my people be the one at fault .      pray to the   Lord ! enough of the thunder    and hail ! I will let you go ; you need stay no long .      Moses reply to he , as soon as I leave the city I will extend my hand to the   Lord ; the thunder will cease , and there will be no more hail so that you may know that the earth belong to the   Lord .      but as for you and your servant , I know that you do not yet fear the   Lord   God .     now the flax and the barley be ruin , because the barley be in ear and the flax in bud .      but the wheat and the spelt be not ruin , for they grow later .     when Moses have leave Pharaoh and go out of the city , he extend his hand to the   Lord . the thunder and the hail cease , and the rain no long pour down upon the earth .      but Pharaoh , see that the rain and the hail and the thunder have cease , sin again and become obstinate , both he and his servant .      in the hardness of his heart , Pharaoh would not let the Israelites go , just as the   Lord   have say through Moses .
