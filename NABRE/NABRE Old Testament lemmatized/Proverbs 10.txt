b '    the proverb of Solomon : a wise son give his father joy ,   but a foolish son be a grief to his mother .     Ill - get treasure profit nothing ,   but justice save from death .     the   Lord   do not let the just go hungry ,   but the craving of the wicked he thwart .    the slack hand impoverishe ,   but the busy hand bring rich .    a son who gather in summer be a credit ;   a son who slumber during harvest , a disgrace .   blessing be for the head of the just ;   but the mouth of the wicked conceal violence .    the memory of the just serve as blessing ,   but the name of the wicked will rot .    a wise heart accept command ,   but a babble fool will be overthrow .    whoever walk honestly walk securely ,   but one whose way be crooked will fare badly .   one who wink at a fault cause trouble ,   but one who frankly reprove promote peace .   the mouth of the just be a fountain of life ,   but the mouth of the wicked conceal violence .   Hatred stir up dispute ,     but love cover all offense .    on the lip of the intelligent be find wisdom ,   but a rod for the back of one without sense .    the wise store up knowledge ,   but the mouth of a fool be imminent ruin .   the wealth of the rich be their strong city ;   the ruin of the poor be their poverty .    the labor of the just lead to life ,   the gain of the wicked , to futility .     whoever follow instruction be in the path to life ,   but whoever disregard reproof go astray .    whoever conceal hatred have lie lip ,   and whoever spread slander be a fool .   where word be many , sin be not want ;   but those who restrain their lip do well .    choice silver be the tongue of the just ;   the heart of the wicked be of little worth .   the lip of the just nourish many ,   but fool die for want of sense .    it be the   Lord s blessing that bring wealth ,    and no effort can substitute for it .    crime be the entertainment of the fool ;   but wisdom be for the person of understanding .   what the wicked fear will befall they ,   but the desire of the just will be grant .   when the tempest pass , the wicked be no more ;   but the just be establish forever .   as vinegar to the tooth , and smoke to the eye ,   be sluggard to those who send they .   fear of the   Lord   prolong life ,   but the year of the wicked be cut short .    the hope of the just bring joy ,   but the expectation of the wicked perishe .    the   Lord   be a stronghold to those who walk honestly ,   downfall for evildoer .   the just will never be disturb ,   but the wicked will not abide in the land .   the mouth of the just yield wisdom ,   but the perverse tongue will be cut off .   the lip of the just know favor ,   but the mouth of the wicked , perversion .
