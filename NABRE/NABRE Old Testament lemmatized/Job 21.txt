b '   Jobs Sixth Reply .     then Job answer and say :     at least listen to my word ,    and let that be the consolation you offer .   Bear with I while I speak ;   and after I have speak , you can mock !   be my complaint toward any human being ?   why should I not be impatient ?   look at I and be appal ,   put your hand over your mouth .   when I think of it , I be dismayed ,   and shudder seize my flesh .    why do the wicked keep on living ,   grow old , become mighty in power ?    their progeny be secure in their sight ;   their offspring be before their eye .   their home be safe , without fear ,   and the rod of God be not upon they .   their bull breed without fail ;   their cow calve and do not miscarry .   they let their young run free like sheep ,   their child skip about .   they sing along with drum and lyre ,   and make merry to the sound of the pipe .   they live out their day in prosperity ,   and tranquilly go down to Sheol .    yet they say to God , Depart from we ,    for we have no desire to know your way !   what be the Almighty that we should serve he ?   and what do we gain by pray to he ?    their happiness be not in their own hand .   the design of the wicked be far from I !    how often be the lamp of the wicked put out ?   how often do destruction come upon they ,   the portion God allot in his anger ?   let they be like straw before the wind ,   like chaff the storm carry away !   God be store up the mans misery for his children?\xe2\x80\x94   let he requite the man himself so that he know it !   let his own eye behold his calamity ,   and the wrath of the Almighty let he drink !   for what interest have he in his family after he ,   when the number of his month be finish ?   can anyone teach God knowledge ,   see that he judge those on high ?    one die in his full vigor ,   wholly at ease and content ;   his figure be full and nourished ,   his bone be moist with marrow .   another die with a bitter spirit ,   never having taste happiness .   alike they lie down in the dust ,   and worm cover they both .   see , I know your thought ,   and the argument you plot against I .   for you say , where be the house of the great ,   and where the dwelling place of the wicked ?   have you not ask the wayfarer   and do you not acknowledge the witness they give ?   on the day of calamity the evil man be spare ,   on the day that wrath be release .   who will charge he to his face about his conduct ,   and for what he have do who will repay he ?   he be carry to the grave   and at his tomb they keep watch .   Sweet to he be the clod of the valley .   all humankind will follow after he ,   and countless other before he .   how empty the consolation you offer I !   your argument remain a fraud .
