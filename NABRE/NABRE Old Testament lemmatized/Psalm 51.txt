b ' the Miserere : prayer of Repentance   for the leader . a psalm of David ,      when Nathan the prophet come to he after he have go in to Bathsheba .     I   have mercy on I , God , in accord with your merciful love ;   in your abundant compassion blot out my transgression .   thoroughly wash away my guilt ;   and from my sin cleanse I .   for I know my transgression ;   my sin be always before I .    against you , you alone have I sin ;   I have do what be evil in your eye so that you be just in your word ,   and without reproach in your judgment .    behold , I be bear in guilt ,   in sin my mother conceive I .     behold , you desire true sincerity ;   and secretly you teach I wisdom .   cleanse I with hyssop ,    that I may be pure ;   wash I , and I will be white than snow .    you will let I hear gladness and joy ;   the bone you have crush will rejoice .    II   turn away your face from my sin ;   blot out all my iniquity .   a clean heart create for I , God ;   renew within I a steadfast spirit .    do not drive I from before your face ,   nor take from I your holy spirit .    restore to I the gladness of your salvation ;   uphold I with a willing spirit .   I will teach the wicked your way ,   that sinner may return to you .   Rescue I from violent bloodshed , God , my save God ,   and my tongue will sing joyfully of your justice .    Lord , you will open my lip ;   and my mouth will proclaim your praise .   for you do not desire sacrifice    or I would give it ;   a burn offering you would not accept .    my sacrifice , o God , be a contrite spirit ;   a contrite , humbled heart , o God , you will not scorn .    III    Treat Zion kindly accord to your good will ;   build up the wall of Jerusalem .    then you will desire the sacrifice of the just ,   burn offering and whole offering ;   then they will offer up young bull on your altar .
