b '   danger from sin    my child , if you have sin , do so no more ,   and for your past sin pray to be forgive .   Flee from sin as from a serpent   that will bite you if you go near it ; its tooth , lion tooth ,   destroy human life .   all lawlessness be like a two - edge sword ;   when it cut , there be no healing .    panic and pride wipe out wealth ;   so too the house of the proud be uproot .   prayer from the lip of the poor be hear at once ,   and justice be quickly grant they .   whoever hate correction walk the sinner path ,    but whoever fear the Lord repent in his heart .   Glib speaker be widely know ,   but when they slip the sensible perceive it .   those who build their house with someone else money   be like those who collect stone for their funeral mound .   a band of criminal be like a bundle of tow ;   they will end in a flame fire .    the path of sinner be smooth stone ,   but its end be the pit of Sheol .     the Wise and Foolish : a Contrast    those who keep the Law control their thought ;   perfect fear of the Lord be wisdom .   one who be not clever can never be teach ,   but there be a cleverness fill with bitterness .     the knowledge of the wise well up like a flood ,   and their counsel like a living spring .    a fool mind be like a broken jar :   it can not hold any knowledge at all .     when the intelligent hear a wise saying ,   they praise it and add to it . the wanton hear it with distaste   and cast it behind their back .     a fool chatter be like a load on a journey ,   but delight be to be find on the lip of the intelligent .   the view of the prudent be seek in an assembly ,   and their word be take to heart .     like a house in ruin be wisdom to a fool ;   to the stupid , knowledge be incomprehensible chatter .   to the senseless , education be fetter on the foot ,   like manacle on the right hand .   fool raise their voice in laughter ,   but the prudent at most smile quietly .    like a gold ornament be education to the wise ,   like a bracelet on the right arm .     a fool step boldly into a house ,   while the well - breed be slow to make an entrance .    a boor peep through the doorway of a house ,   but the educated stay outside .   it be rude for one to listen at a door ;   the discreet person would be overwhelm by the disgrace .     the lip of the arrogant talk of what be not their concern ,   but the discreet carefully weigh their word .   the mind of fool be in their mouth ,   but the mouth of the wise be in their mind .    when the godless curse their adversary ,    they really curse themselves .   slanderer sully themselves ,   and be hate by their neighbor .
