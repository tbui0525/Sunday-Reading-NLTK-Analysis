b '    once Samson go to Gaza , where he see a prostitute and visit she .      the people of Gaza be tell , Samson have come here , and they surround he with an ambush at the city gate all night long . and all the night they wait , say , at morning light we will kill he .      Samson lie there until midnight . then he rise at midnight , seize the door of the city gate and the two gatepost , and tear they loose , bar and all . he hoist they on his shoulder and carry they to the top of the ridge opposite Hebron .

Delilah say to Samson , you have mock I and tell I lie . now tell I how you may be bind .      if they bind I tight with new rope , with which no work have be do , he answer she , I shall grow weak and be like anyone else .      so Delilah take new rope and bind he with they . then she say to he , the Philistines be upon you , Samson ! for there be man lie in wait in the room . but he snap the rope off his arm like thread .     Delilah say to Samson again , up to now you have mock I and tell I lie . tell I how you may be bind . he say to she , if you weave the seven lock of my hair into the web and fasten they with the pin , I shall grow weak and be like anyone else .      so when he go to bed , Delilah take the seven lock of his hair and wove they into the web , and fasten they with the pin . then she say , the Philistines be upon you , Samson ! awaken from his sleep , he pull out both the loom and the web .      then she say to he , how can you say I love you when your heart be not mine ? three time already you have mock I , and not tell I where you get your great strength !       she press he continually and pester he till he be deathly weary of it .      so he tell she all that be in his heart and say , no razor have touch my head , for I have be a nazirite for God from my mother womb .    if I be shave , my strength will leave I , and I shall grow weak and be like anyone else .      when Delilah realize that he have tell she all that be in his heart , she summon the lord of the Philistines , say , come up this time , for he have tell I all that be in his heart . so the lord of the Philistines come to she and bring the money with they .        she put he to sleep on her lap , and call for a man who shave off the seven lock of his hair . he immediately become helpless , for his strength have leave he .        when she say the Philistines be upon you , Samson ! he wake from his sleep and think , I will go out as I have do time and again and shake myself free . he do not realize that the   Lord   have leave he .      but the Philistines seize he and gouge out his eye . then they bring he down to Gaza and bind he with bronze fetter , and he be put to grind grain in the prison .      but the hair of his head begin to grow as soon as it be shave .    the Death of Samson .      the lord of the Philistines assemble to offer a great sacrifice to their god Dagon    and to celebrate . they say , our god have deliver Samson our enemy into our power .      when the people see he , they praise their god . for they say , our god have deliver into our power   our enemy , the ravager of our land ,   the one who have multiply our slay .     when their spirit be high , they say , Call Samson that he may amuse we . so they call Samson from the prison , and he provide amusement for they . they make he stand between the column ,      and Samson say to the attendant who be hold his hand , put I where I may touch the column that support the temple , so that I may lean against they .      the temple be full of man and woman : all the lord of the Philistines be there , and from the roof about three thousand man and woman look on as Samson provide amusement .      Samson cry out to the   Lord   and say , Lord   God , remember I ! strengthen I only this once that I may avenge myself on the Philistines at one blow for my two eye .      Samson grasp the two middle column on which the temple rest and brace himself against they , one at his right , the other at his left .      then say , let I die with the Philistines ! Samson push hard , and the temple fall upon the lord and all the people who be in it . those he kill by his dying be more than those he have kill during his lifetime .     his kinsman and all his father house go down and bear he up for burial in the grave of Manoah his father between Zorah and Eshtaol . he have judge Israel for twenty year .
