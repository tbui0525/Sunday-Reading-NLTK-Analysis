b ' praise of Gods Care for the Poor   Hallelujah ! I praise , you servant of the   Lord ,   praise the name of the   Lord .    bless be the name of the   Lord   both now and forever .   from the rise of the sun to its setting    let the name of the   Lord   be praise .    II   high above all nation be the   Lord ;   above the heaven his glory .    who be like the   Lord   our God ,   enthrone on high ,     look down on heaven and earth ?   he raise the needy from the dust ,   lift the poor from the ash heap ,    seat they with prince ,   the prince of the people ,   give the childless wife a home ,   the joyful mother of child .   Hallelujah !             '
