b '   punishment and death of Antiochus IV .       about that time Antiochus retreat in disgrace from the region of Persia .      he have enter the city call Persepolis and attempt to rob the temple and gain control of the city . thereupon the people have swift recourse to arm , and Antiochus force be route , so that in the end Antiochus be put to flight by the people of that region and force to beat a shameful retreat .      on his arrival in Ecbatana , he learn what have happen to Nicanor and to Timothys force .      overcome with anger , he plan to make the Jews suffer for the injury do by those who have put he to flight . therefore he order his charioteer to drive without stop until he finish the journey . yet the condemnation of Heaven ride with he , because he say in his arrogance , I will make Jerusalem the common graveyard of Jews as soon as I arrive there .     so the all - see Lord , the God of Israel , strike he down with an incurable and invisible blow ; for scarcely have he utter those word when he be seize with excruciating pain in his bowel and sharp internal torment ,        a fit punishment for he who have torture the bowel of other with many barbarous torment .      far from give up his insolence , he be all the more fill with arrogance . breathe fire in his rage against the Jews , he give order to drive even fast . as a result he hurtle from the speed chariot , and every part of his body be rack by the violent fall .      thus he who previously , in his superhuman presumption , think he could command the wave of the sea , and imagine he could weigh the mountaintop in his scale , be now throw to the ground and have to be carry on a litter , clearly manifest to all the power of God .        the body of this impious man swarm with worm , and while he be still alive in hideous torment , his flesh rot off , so that the entire army be sicken by the stench of his corruption .        shortly before , he have think that he could reach the star of heaven , and now , no one could endure to transport the man because of this intolerable stench .     at last , break in spirit , he begin to give up his excessive arrogance , and to gain some understanding , under the scourge of God , for he be rack with pain unceasingly .      when he could no long bear his own stench , he say , it be right to be subject to God , and not to think one mortal self equal to God .        then this vile man vow to he who would never again show he mercy , the Sovereign Lord ,      that the holy city , toward which he have be hurry with the intention of level it to the ground and make it a common graveyard , he would now set free ;      that the Jews , whom he have judge not even worthy of burial , but fit only to be throw out with their child to be eat by vulture and wild animals\xe2\x80\x94all of they he would make equal to the Athenians ;      that he would adorn with the fine offering the holy temple which he have previously despoiled , restore all the sacred vessel many time over , and provide from his own revenue the expense require for the sacrifice .      besides all this , he would become a Jew himself and visit every inhabit place to proclaim there the power of God .      but since his suffering be not lessen , for god just judgment have come upon he , he lose hope for himself and write the follow letter to the Jews in the form of a supplication . it read thus :      to the worthy jewish citizen , Antiochus , king and general , send hearty greeting and best wish for their health and prosperity .      if you and your child be well and your affair be go as you wish , I thank God very much , for my hope be in heaven .      now that I be ill , I recall with affection your esteem and goodwill . on return from the region of Persia , I fall victim to a troublesome illness ; so I think it necessary to form plan for the general security of all .      I do not despair about my health , since I have much hope of recover from my illness .      nevertheless , I know that my father , whenever he go on campaign in the hinterland , would name his successor ,      so that , if anything unexpected happen or any unwelcome news come , the people throughout the realm would know to whom the government have be entrust , and so not be disturb .      I be also bear in mind that the neighboring ruler , especially those on the border of our kingdom , be on the watch for opportunity and wait to see what will happen . I have therefore appoint as king my son Antiochus , whom I have often before entrust and commend to most of you , when I make hurried visit to the outlying province . I have write to he what be write here .      therefore I beg and entreat each of you to remember the general and individual benefit you have receive , and to continue to show goodwill toward I and my son .      I be confident that , follow my policy , he will treat you with equity and kindness in his relation with you .     so this murderer and blasphemer , after extreme suffering , such as he have inflict on other , die a miserable death in the mountain of a foreign land .      his foster brother    Philip bring the body home ; but fear Antiochus son , he later withdraw into Egypt , to Ptolemy Philometor .
