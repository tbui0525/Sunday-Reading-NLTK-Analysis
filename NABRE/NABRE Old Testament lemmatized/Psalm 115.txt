b ' the Greatness of the true God I   not to we ,   Lord , not to we   but to your name give glory   because of your mercy and faithfulness .    why should the nation say ,   where be their God ?     our God be in heaven   and do whatever he will .     II   their idol be silver and gold ,    the work of human hand .    they have mouth but do not speak ,   eye but do not see .   they have ear but do not hear ,   nose but do not smell .   they have hand but do not feel ,   foot but do not walk ;   they produce no sound from their throat .   their maker will be like they ,   and anyone who trust in they .    III    the house of Israel trust in the   Lord ,    who be their help and shield .    the house of Aaron trust in the   Lord ,   who be their help and shield .   those who fear the   Lord   trust in the   Lord ,   who be their help and shield .   the   Lord   remember we and will bless we ,   will bless the house of Israel ,   will bless the house of Aaron ,   will bless those who fear the   Lord ,   small and great alike .   may the   Lord   increase your number ,   your and your descendant .   may you be bless by the   Lord ,   maker of heaven and earth .    the heaven belong to the   Lord ,   but he have give the earth to the child of Adam .     the dead do not praise the   Lord ,   not all those go down into silence .    it be we who bless the   Lord ,   both now and forever . Hallelujah !             '
