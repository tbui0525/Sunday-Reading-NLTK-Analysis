b '   the death of Ephraim   when Ephraim speak there be terror ;   he be exalt in Israel ;    but he become guilty through Baal and die .     now they continue to sin ,   make for themselves molten image , silver idol accord to their skill ,    all of they the work of artisan . to these , offer sacrifice , they say .   People kiss calf !     therefore , they will be like a morning cloud   or like the dew that vanish with the dawn , like chaff storm - drive from the threshing floor    or like smoke out of the window .     I , the   Lord , be your God ,   since the land of Egypt ;    god apart from I you do not know ;   there be no savior but I .    I feed you in the wilderness ,   in the parched land .   when I feed they , they be satisfied ;   when satisfied , they become proud ,   therefore they forget I .   so , I will be like a lion to they ,   like a leopard by the road I will keep watch .    I will attack they like a bear rob of its young ,   and tear their heart from their breast ; I will devour they on the spot like a lion ,   as a wild animal would rip they open .      I destroy you , Israel !   who be there to help you ?   where now be your king ,   that he may rescue you ? and all your prince ,   that they may defend you ? of whom you say ,   give I a king and prince ?    I give you a king in my anger ,   and I take he away in my wrath .      the guilt of Ephraim be wrap up ,   his sin be store away .    the birth pang will come for he ,    but this be an unwise child , who , when it be time , do not present himself   at the mouth of the womb .     shall I deliver they from the power of Sheol ?   shall I redeem they from death ? where be your plague , o death !   where be your sting , Sheol !    Compassion be hide from my eye .     though Ephraim    may flourish among his brother ,   an east wind    will come , a wind from the   Lord ,   rise from the wilderness , that will dry up his spring ,   and leave his fountain dry . it will loot his treasury   of every precious thing .
