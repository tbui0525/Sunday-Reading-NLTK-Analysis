b ' Petition and Thanksgiving   of David . I to you ,   Lord , I call ;   my Rock , do not be deaf to I ,   do not be silent toward I ,   so that I join those who go down to the pit .    hear the sound of my pleading when I cry to you for help   when I lift up my hand toward your holy place .     do not drag I off with the wicked ,   with those who do wrong ,   who speak peace to their neighbor   though evil be in their heart .    repay they for their deed ,   for the evil that they do . for the work of their hand repay they ;   give they what they deserve .    because they do not understand the   Lord s work ,   the work of his hand ,   he will tear they down ,   never to rebuild they .    II    bless be the   Lord ,   who have hear the sound of my pleading .   the   Lord   be my strength and my shield ,   in whom my heart trust . I be help , so my heart rejoice ;   with my song I praise he .    III    Lord , you be a strength for your people ,   the save refuge of your anoint .   save your people , bless your inheritance ;   pasture and carry they forever !             '
