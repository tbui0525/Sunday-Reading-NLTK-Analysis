b ' prayer in Time of Distress   a prayer of David . I incline your ear ,   Lord , and answer I ,   for I be poor and oppressed .   preserve my life , for I be devote ;   save your servant who trust in you . you be my God ;      be gracious to I , Lord ;   to you I call all the day .   Gladden the soul of your servant ;   to you , Lord , I lift up my soul .    Lord , you be good and forgiving ,   most merciful to all who call on you .    Lord , hear my prayer ;   listen to my cry for help .    on the day of my distress I call to you ,   for you will answer I .    II   none among the god can equal you , o Lord ;   nor can their deed compare to yours .    all the nation you have make shall come   to bow before you , Lord ,   and give honor to your name .    for you be great and do wondrous deed ;   and you alone be God .    III   teach I ,   Lord , your way   that I may walk in your truth ,    single - hearted and revere your name .   I will praise you with all my heart ,   glorify your name forever , Lord my God .   your mercy to I be great ;   you have rescue I from the depth of Sheol .    o God , the arrogant have rise against I ;   a ruthless band have seek my life ;   to you they pay no heed .   but you , Lord , be a compassionate and gracious God ,   slow to anger , abound in mercy and truth .    turn to I , be gracious to I ;   give your strength to your servant ;   save the son of your handmaid .    give I a sign of your favor :   make my enemy see , to their confusion ,   that you ,   Lord , help and comfort I .
