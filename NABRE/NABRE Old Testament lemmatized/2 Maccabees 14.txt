Judas brother Simon have engage Nicanor , but he suffer a slight setback because of the sudden appearance of the enemy .     however , when Nicanor hear of the valor of Judas and his companion , and the great courage with which they fight for their country , he shrink from decide the issue by bloodshed .      so he send Posidonius , Theodotus and Mattathias to exchange pledge of friendship .      after a long discussion of the term , each leader communicate they to his troop ; and when general agreement be express , they assent to the treaty .      a day be set on which the leader would meet by themselves . from each side a chariot come forward , and throne be set in place .      Judas have post armed man in readiness at strategic point for fear that the enemy might suddenly commit some treachery . but the conference be hold in the proper way .     Nicanor stay on in Jerusalem , where he do nothing out of place . he disband the throng of people who gather around he ;      and he always keep Judas in his company , for he feel affection    for the man .      he urge he to marry and have child ; so Judas marry and settle into an ordinary life .    nicanor threat against Judas .     when Alcimus see their mutual goodwill , he take the treaty that have be make , go to Demetrius , and say that Nicanor be plot against the government , for he have appoint Judas , that conspirator against the kingdom , as his successor .      stir up by the villain slander , the king become enraged . he write to Nicanor , state that he be displeased with the treaty , and order he to send Maccabeus at once as a prisoner to Antioch .      when this message reach Nicanor he be dismay and trouble at the thought of annul his agreement with a man who have do no wrong .      however , there be no way of oppose the king , so he watch for an opportunity to carry out this order by a stratagem .      but Maccabeus , notice that Nicanor be more harsh in his dealing with he , and act with unaccustomed rudeness when they meet , conclude that this harshness be not a good sign . so he gather together not a few of his man , and go into hiding from Nicanor .      when Nicanor realize that he have be cleverly outwit by the man , he go to the great and holy temple , at a time when the priest be offer the customary sacrifice , and order they to surrender Judas .      as they declare under oath that they do not know where the man they seek be ,      he stretch out his right arm toward the temple and swear this oath : if you do not hand Judas over to I as prisoner , I will level this shrine of God to the ground ; I will tear down the altar , and erect here a splendid temple to Dionysus .     with these word he go away . the priest stretch out their hand toward heaven , call upon the unfailing defender of our nation in these word :      Lord of all , though you be in need of nothing , you be pleased to have a temple for your dwelling place among we .      therefore , Holy One , Lord of all holiness , preserve forever undefiled this house , which have be so recently purify .   Martyrdom of Razis .        a certain Razis , one of the elder of Jerusalem , be denounce to Nicanor as a patriot . a man highly regard , he be call a father of the Jews because of his goodwill toward they .      in the day before the revolt , he have be convict of be a Jew , and have risk body and soul in his ardent zeal for Judaism .      Nicanor , to show his disdain for the Jews , send more than five hundred soldier to arrest he .      he think that by arrest that man he would deal the Jews a hard blow .     but when the troop , on the point of capture the tower , be force the outer gate and call for fire to set the door ablaze , Razis , now catch on all side , turn his sword against himself ,      prefer to die nobly    rather than fall into the hand of vile man and suffer outrage unworthy of his noble birth .      in the excitement of the struggle he fail to strike exactly . so while the troop rush in through the door , he gallantly run up to the top of the wall and courageously throw himself down into the crowd .      but as they quickly draw back and leave an opening , he fall into the middle of the empty space .      still breathe , and inflame with anger , he get up and run through the crowd , with blood gush from his frightful wound . then , stand on a steep rock ,      as he lose the last of his blood , he tear out his entrail and fling they with both hand into the crowd , call upon the Lord of life and of spirit to give these back to he again . such be the manner of his death .
