b '   the Prince of Tyre .      the word of the   Lord   come to I :      Son of man , say to the prince of Tyre : thus say the Lord   God : because you be haughty of heart ,   you say , I be a god ! I sit on a god throne   in the heart of the sea ! but you be a man , not a god ;   yet you pretend   you be a god at heart !   oh yes , you be wise than Daniel ,    nothing secret be too obscure for you !    by your wisdom and intelligence   you make yourself rich ,   fill your treasury with gold and silver .   through your great wisdom in trading   you heap up rich for yourself\xe2\x80\x94   your heart be haughty because of your rich .    therefore thus say the Lord   God : because you pretend you be a god at heart ,   therefore , I will bring against you   stranger , the most bloodthirsty of nation . they shall draw their sword   against your splendid wisdom ,   and violate your radiance .    they shall thrust you down into the pit :   you shall die a violent death   in the heart of the sea .   then , face to face with your killer ,   will you still say , I be a god ? no , you be a man , not a god ,   hand over to those who slay you .   you shall die the death of the uncircumcised   hand over to stranger ,   for I have spoken\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the Lord   God .      the word of the   Lord   come to I :      Son of man , raise a lament over the king of Tyre , and say to he : thus say the Lord   God :    you be a seal of perfection ,   full of wisdom , perfect in beauty .    in Eden , the garden of God , you live ;   precious stone of every kind be your covering : Carnelian , topaz , and beryl ,   chrysolite , onyx , and jasper ,   sapphire , garnet , and emerald . their mount and setting   be work in gold ,   fashion for you the day you be create .    with a cherub I place you ;   I put you on the holy mountain of God ,    where you walk among fiery stone .   blameless be you in your way   from the day you be create , until evil be find in you .    your commerce be full of lawlessness , and you sin . therefore I banish you from the mountain of God ;   the cherub drive you out   from among the fiery stone .    your heart have grow haughty   because of your beauty ; you corrupt your wisdom   because of your splendor . I cast you to the ground ,   I make you a spectacle   in the sight of king .    because of the enormity of your guilt ,   and the perversity of your trade ,   you defile your sanctuary . I bring fire out of you ;   it devour you ; I make you ashe on the ground   in the eye of all who see you .    all the nation who know you   be appal on account of you ; you have become a horror ,   never to be again .     against Sidon .     the word of the   Lord   come to I :      Son of man , turn your face toward Sidon and prophesy against it .      thus say the Lord   God : watch out ! I be against you , Sidon ;   I will win glory for myself in your midst . they shall know that I be the   Lord ,   when I deliver judgment upon it   and manifest my holiness in it .   I will send disease into it ;   blood will fill its street , within it shall fall   those slay by the sword   raise against it on every side . then they shall know that I be the   Lord .   no long will there be a thorn that tear   or a bri that scratch for the house of Israel from the surround neighbor   who despise they ;   thus they shall know that I be the   Lord .      thus say the Lord   God : when I gather the house of Israel from the people among whom they be scatter , and I manifest my holiness through they in the sight of the nation , then they shall live on the land I give my servant Jacob .        they shall dwell on it securely , build house and plant vineyard . they shall dwell securely while I execute judgment on all their neighbor who treat they with contempt ; then they shall know that I , the   Lord , be their God .
