b ' praise of God , Israels Deliverer   for the leader . a song ; a psalm .    I   shout joyfully to God , all the earth ;   sing of his glorious name ;   give he glorious praise .    say to God : how awesome your deed !   before your great strength your enemy cringe .   all the earth fall in worship before you ;    they sing of you , sing of your name ! Selah    II    come and see the work of God ,   awesome in deed before the child of Adam .   he change the sea to dry land ;   through the river they pass on foot .   there we rejoice in he ,    who rule by his might forever , his eye be fix upon the nation .   let no rebel rise to challenge ! Selah   bless our God , you people ;   loudly sound his praise ,   who have keep we alive   and not allow our foot to slip .    you test we , o God ,   try we as silver try by fire .    you lead we into a snare ;   you bind we at the waist as captive .    you let captor set foot on our neck ;   we go through fire and water ;   then you lead we out to freedom .     III   I will bring burn offering    to your house ;   to you I will fulfill my vow ,   which my lip pronounce   and my mouth speak in my distress .   burn offering of fatling I will offer you   and sacrificial smoke of ram ;   I will sacrifice oxen and goat . Selah   come and hear , all you who fear God ,   while I recount what have be do for I .   I call to he with my mouth ;   praise be upon my tongue .   have I cherish evil in my heart ,   the Lord would not have hear .   but God do hear   and listen to my voice in prayer .   bless be God , who do not reject my prayer   and refuse his mercy .
