b '   a just Shepherd .       Woe to the shepherd who destroy and scatter the flock of my pasture\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord .      therefore , thus say the   Lord , the God of Israel , against the shepherd who shepherd my people : you have scatter my sheep and drive they away . you have not care for they , but I will take care to punish your evil deed .        I myself will gather the remnant of my flock from all the land to which I have banish they and bring they back to their fold ; there they shall be fruitful and multiply .        I will raise up shepherd for they who will shepherd they so that they need no long fear or be terrify ; none shall be missing\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord .      see , day be coming\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord \xe2\x80\x94   when I will raise up a righteous branch for David ; as king he shall reign and govern wisely ,   he shall do what be just and right in the land .    in his day Judah shall be save ,   Israel shall dwell in security . this be the name to be give he :   the   Lord   our justice .       therefore , the day be coming\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord \xe2\x80\x94when they shall no long say , as the   Lord   live , who bring the Israelites out of the land of Egypt ;      but rather , as the   Lord   live , who bring the descendant of the house of Israel up from the land of the north\xe2\x80\x94and from all the land to which I banish they ; they shall again live on their own soil .    the false prophet    concern the prophet : my heart be break within I ,   all my bone tremble ; I be like a drunk ,   like one overcome by wine , because of the   Lord ,   because of his holy word .   the land be fill with adulterer ;   because of the curse the land mourn ,   the pasture of the wilderness be wither .   Theirs be an evil course ,   theirs be unjust power .   both prophet and priest be godless !   in my very house I find their wickedness\xe2\x80\x94   oracle of the   Lord .    hence their way shall become for they   slippery ground . into the darkness they shall be drive ,   and fall headlong ; for I will bring disaster upon they ,   the year of their punishment\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord .    among Samarias prophet   I see something unseemly : they prophesy by Baal   and lead my people Israel astray .    but among jerusalem prophet   I see something more shocking : Adultery , walk in deception ,    strengthen the power of the wicked ,   so that no one turn from evil ; to I they be all like Sodom ,   its inhabitant like Gomorrah .      therefore , thus say the   Lord   of host against the prophet : look , I will give they wormwood to eat ,   and poison water to drink ; for from Jerusalems prophet   ungodliness have go forth into the whole land .     thus say the   Lord   of host : do not listen to the word of your prophet ,   who fill you with emptiness ; they speak vision from their own fancy ,   not from the mouth of the   Lord .    they say to those who despise the word of the   Lord ,    Peace shall be yours ; and to everyone who walk in hardness of heart ,   no evil shall overtake you .    now , who have stand in the council of the   Lord ,   to see he and to hear his word ?   who have heed his word so as to announce it ?    see , the storm of the   Lord !   his wrath break forth in a whirling storm   that burst upon the head of the wicked .    the anger of the   Lord   shall not abate   until he have carry out completely   the decision of his heart . in day to come   you will understand fully .   I do not send these prophet ,   yet they run ; I do not speak to they ,   yet they prophesy .    have they stand in my council ,   they would have proclaim my word to my people , they would have bring they back from their evil way   and from their wicked deed .   be I a God near at hand only\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord \xe2\x80\x94    and not a God far off ?    can anyone hide in secret   without my see them?\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord . do I not fill   heaven and earth?\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord .     I have hear the prophet who prophesy lie in my name say , I have a dream ! I have a dream !      how long ? will the heart of the prophet who prophesy lie and their own deceitful fancy ever turn back ?      by the dream they tell each other , they plan to make my people forget my name , just as their ancestor forget my name for Baal .        let the prophet who have dream tell their dream ; let those who have my word speak my word truthfully ! what have straw to do with wheat ?    \xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord .    be not my word like fire\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord \xe2\x80\x94   like a hammer shatter rock ?     therefore I be against the prophets\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord \xe2\x80\x94those who steal my word from each other .        yes , I be against the prophets\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord \xe2\x80\x94those who compose their own speech and call they oracle .      yes , I be against the prophet who tell lie dreams\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord \xe2\x80\x94those who lead my people astray by recount their reckless lie . it be not I who send they or command they ; they do this people no good at all\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord .       and when this people or a prophet or a priest ask you , what be the burden of the   Lord ? you shall answer , you be the burden , and I cast you off\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord .      if a prophet or a priest or anyone else mention the burden of the   Lord , I will punish that man and his household .      thus you shall ask , when speak to one another , what answer do the   Lord   give ? or what do the   Lord   say ?      but the burden of the   Lord   you shall mention no more . for each of you , your own word become the burden so that you pervert the word of the live God , the   Lord   of host , our God .      thus shall you ask the prophet , what answer do the   Lord   give ? or what do the   Lord   say ?      but if you ask about the burden of the   Lord , then thus say the   Lord : because you use this phrase , the burden of the   Lord , though I forbid you to use it ,      therefore I will lift you on high and cast you from my presence , you and the city which I give to you and your ancestor .      and I will bring upon you eternal reproach , eternal shame , never to be forget .
