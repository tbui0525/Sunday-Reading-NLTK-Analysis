b ' God , the Rescuer of the People   a song of ascent . of David . have not the   Lord   be with we ,   let Israel say ,    have not the   Lord   be with we ,   when people rise against we ,   then they would have swallow we alive ,    for their fury blaze against we .   then the water would have engulf we ,   the torrent overwhelm we ;     then seething water would have drown we .   bless be the   Lord , who do not leave we   to be tear by their tooth .   we escape with our life like a bird   from the fowler snare ;   the snare be break ,   and we escape .    our help be in the name of the   Lord ,   the maker of heaven and earth .
