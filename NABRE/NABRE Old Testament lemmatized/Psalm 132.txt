b ' the Covenant between David and God   a song of ascent . I remember , O   Lord , for David   all his hardship ;   how he swear an oath to the   Lord ,   vow to the Mighty One of Jacob :    I will not enter the house where I live ,    nor lie on the couch where I sleep ;   I will give my eye no sleep ,   my eyelid no rest ,   till I find a place for the   Lord ,   a dwelling for the Mighty One of Jacob .   we have hear of it in Ephrathah ;    we have find it in the field of Jaar .   let we enter his dwelling ;   let we worship at his footstool .    Arise ,   Lord , come to your rest place ,    you and your mighty ark .   your priest will be clothe with justice ;   your devout will shout for joy .   for the sake of David your servant ,   do not reject your anoint .    II   the   Lord   swear an oath to David in truth ,   he will never turn back from it :   your own offspring    I will set upon your throne .   if your son observe my covenant ,   and my decree I shall teach they , their son , in turn ,   shall sit forever on your throne .   yes , the   Lord   have choose Zion ,   desire it for a dwelling :   this be my rest place forever ;   here I will dwell , for I desire it .   I will bless Zion with provision ;   its poor I will fill with bread .   I will clothe its priest with salvation ;   its devout shall shout for joy .    there I will make a horn sprout for David ;     I will set a lamp for my anoint .   his foe I will clothe with shame ,   but on he his crown shall shine .
