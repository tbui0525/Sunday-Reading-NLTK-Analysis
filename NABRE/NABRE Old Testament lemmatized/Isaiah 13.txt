b ' chapter 13 Babylon .      an oracle    concern Babylon ; a vision of Isaiah , son of Amoz .     upon the bare mountain set up a signal ;   cry out to they ,   Beckon for they to enter   the gate of the noble .    I have command my consecrated one ,    I have summon my warrior ,   eager and bold to carry out my anger .    listen ! the rumble on the mountain :   that of an immense throng ! listen ! the noise of kingdom , nation assemble ! the   Lord   of host be muster   an army for battle .    they come from a far - off country ,   and from the end of the heaven , the   Lord   and the instrument of his wrath ,   to destroy all the land .   Howl , for the day of the   Lord    be near ;   as destruction from the Almighty it come .    therefore all hand fall helpless ,    every human heart melt ,    and they be terrified , Pangs and sorrow take hold of they ,   like a woman in labor they writhe ; they look aghast at each other ,   their face aflame .    indeed , the day of the   Lord   come ,   cruel , with wrath and burning anger ; to lay waste the land   and destroy the sinner within it !    the star of the heaven and their constellation   will send forth no light ; the sun will be dark at its rise ,   and the moon will not give its light .    thus I will punish the world for its evil   and the wicked for their guilt . I will put an end to the pride of the arrogant ,   the insolence of tyrant I will humble .    I will make mortal more rare than pure gold ,   human being , than the gold of Ophir .     for this I will make the heavens tremble   and the earth shall be shake from its place , at the wrath of the   Lord   of host   on the day of his burn anger .    like a hunted gazelle ,   or a flock that no one gather , they shall turn each to their own people   and flee each to their own land .    everyone who be take shall be run through ;   and everyone who be catch shall fall by the sword .   their infant shall be dash to piece in their sight ;   their house shall be plunder   and their wife ravish .    I be stir up against they the Medes ,   who think nothing of silver   and take no delight in gold .    with their bow they shall shatter the young man , and the fruit of the womb they shall not spare ,   nor shall their eye take pity on child .   and Babylon , the jewel of kingdom ,   the glory and pride of the Chaldeans , shall become like Sodom and Gomorrah ,   overthrow by God .    it shall never be inhabit ,   nor dwelt in , from age to age ; Arabians shall not pitch their tent there ,   nor shepherd rest their flock there .    but desert demon shall rest there   and owl shall fill the house ; there ostrich shall dwell ,   and satyrs    shall dance .    wild dog shall dwell in its castle ,   and jackal in its luxurious palace . its time be near at hand   and its day shall not be prolong .
