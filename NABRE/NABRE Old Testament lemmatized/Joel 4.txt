b '   the Lords Case against the nation   for see , in those day and at that time ,    when I restore the fortune   of Judah and Jerusalem ,   I will gather all the nation   and bring they down to the Valley of Jehoshaphat .   there I will enter into judgment with they   on behalf of my people , my heritage , Israel ; because they scatter they among the nation ,   they divide up my land .    for my people they cast lot ,   trade a young boy for the price of a prostitute ,   exchange a young girl for the wine they drink .       moreover , what be you do to I , Tyre and Sidon , and all the region of Philistia ? be you pay I back for something ? if you be , I will very quickly turn your deed back upon your own head .        you take my silver and my gold and bring my priceless treasure into your temple !      you sell the people of Judah and Jerusalem to the Greeks , take they far from their own country !      look ! I be rouse they from the place to which you sell they , and I will turn your deed back upon your own head .      I will sell your son and daughter to the Judahites who will sell they to the Sabeans ,    a distant nation . the   Lord   have speak !    the Nations destroyed   announce this to the nation :   proclaim a holy war !   alert the warrior ! let all the soldier   report and march !     beat your plowshare into sword ,   and your pruning knife into spear ;   let the weakling boast , I be a warrior !      hurry and come , all you neighbor people ,   assemble there ! bring down ,   Lord , your warrior !   let the nation rouse themselves and come up   to the Valley of Jehoshaphat ; for there I will sit in judgment   upon all the neighboring nation .     Wield the sickle ,    for the harvest be ripe ; come and tread ,   for the wine press be full ; the vat overflow ,   for their crime be numerous .    crowd upon crowd   in the Valley of decision ; for near be the day of the   Lord   in the Valley of Decision .    Sun and moon be darken ,   and the star withhold their brightness ,    the   Lord   roar from Zion ,   and from Jerusalem raise his voice ,   the heaven and the earth quake ,   but the   Lord   will be a shelter for his people ,   a fortress for the people of Israel .    a secure future for Judah   then you will know    that I the   Lord   be your God ,    dwell on Zion , my holy mountain ; Jerusalem will be holy ,   and stranger will never again travel through she .    on that day   the mountain will drip new wine ,   and the hill flow with milk , all the stream of Judah   will flow with water . a spring will rise from the house of the   Lord ,   water the Valley of Shittim .    Egypt will be a waste ,   Edom a desolate wilderness , because of violence do to the Judahites ,   because they shed innocent blood in their land .    but Judah will be inhabit forever ,   and Jerusalem for all generation .   I will avenge their blood ,   and I will not acquit the guilt .   the   Lord   dwell in Zion .             '
