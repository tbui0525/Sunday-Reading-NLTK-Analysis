b '     a mild answer turn back wrath ,    but a harsh word stir up anger .    the tongue of the wise pour out knowledge ,   but the mouth of fool spews folly .   the eye of the   Lord   be in every place ,   keep watch on the evil and the good .   a soothing tongue be a tree of life ,   but a perverse one break the spirit .   the fool spurn a father instruction ,   but whoever heed reproof be prudent .     in the house of the just there be ample resource ,   but the harvest of the wicked be in peril .   the lip of the wise spread knowledge ,   but the heart of fool be not steadfast .    the sacrifice of the wicked be an abomination to the   Lord ,    but the prayer of the upright be his delight .   the way of the wicked be an abomination to the   Lord ,   but he love one who pursue justice .    Discipline seem bad to those go astray ;   one who hate reproof will die .    Sheol and Abaddon    lie open before the   Lord ;   how much more the heart of mortal !   Scoffers do not love reproof ;   to the wise they will not go .   a glad heart light up the face ,   but an anguished heart break the spirit .    the discerning heart seek knowledge ,   but the mouth of fool feed on folly .    all the day of the poor be evil ,   but a good heart be a continual feast .     well a little with fear of the   Lord   than a great fortune with anxiety .   well a dish of herb where love be   than a fat ox and hatred with it .   the ill - temper stir up strife ,    but the patient settle dispute .   the way of the sluggard be like a thorn hedge ,   but the path of the diligent be a highway .   a wise son give his father joy ,   but a fool despise his mother .    Folly be joy    to the senseless ,   but the person of understanding go the straight way .   plan fail when there be no counsel ,   but they succeed when adviser be many .     one have joy from an apt response ;   a word in season , how good it be !     the path of life lead upward for the prudent ,   turn they from Sheol below .    the   Lord   pull down the house of the proud ,   but preserve intact the widow landmark .   the scheme of the wicked be an abomination to the   Lord ,    but gracious word be pure .    the greedy tear down their own house ,   but those who hate bribe will live .    the heart of the just ponder a response ,   but the mouth of the wicked spews evil .   the   Lord   be far from the wicked ,   but hear the prayer of the just .   a cheerful glance bring joy to the heart ;   good news invigorate the bone .   the ear that listen to salutary reproof    be at home among the wise .    those who disregard discipline hate themselves ,   but those who heed reproof acquire understanding .   the fear of the   Lord   be train for wisdom ,   and humility go before honor .
