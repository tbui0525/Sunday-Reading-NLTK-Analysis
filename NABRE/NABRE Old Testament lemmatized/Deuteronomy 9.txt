b '   Unmerited Success .     hear , o Israel ! you be now about to cross the Jordan to enter in and dispossess nation great and strong than yourself , have large city fortify to the heavens ,        the Anakim , a people great and tall .    you yourselves know of they and have hear it say of they , who can stand up against the Anakim ?      know , then , today that it be the   Lord , your God , who will cross over before you as a consume fire ; he it be who will destroy they and subdue they before you , so that you can dispossess and remove they quickly , as the   Lord   promise you .        after the   Lord , your God , have drive they out of your way , do not say in your heart , it be because of my justice the   Lord   have bring I in to possess this land ,    and because of the wickedness of these nation the   Lord   be dispossess they before I .        no , it be not because of your justice or the integrity of your heart that you be go in to take possession of their land ; but it be because of their wickedness that the   Lord , your God , be dispossess these nation before you and in order to fulfill the promise he make on oath to your ancestor , Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob .        know this , therefore : it be not because of your justice that the   Lord , your God , be give you this good land to possess , for you be a stiff - necked people .     the Golden Calf .     remember and do not forget how you anger the   Lord , your God , in the wilderness . from the day you leave the land of Egypt until you come to this place , you have be rebellious toward the   Lord .         at Horeb you so provoke the   Lord   that he be angry enough to destroy you ,        when I have go up the mountain to receive the stone tablet of the covenant which the   Lord   make with you .    meanwhile I stay on the mountain forty day and forty night ; I eat no food and drink no water .      the   Lord   give I the two stone tablet inscribe , by Gods own finger ,    with a copy of all the word that the   Lord   speak to you on the mountain from the midst of the fire on the day of the assembly .      then , at the end of the forty day and forty night , when the   Lord   have give I the two stone tablet , the tablet of the covenant ,       the   Lord   say to I , go down from here now , quickly , for your people whom you have bring out of Egypt be act corruptly ; they have already turn aside from the way I command they and have make for themselves a molten idol .      I have see now how stiff - neck this people be , the   Lord   say to I .      let I be , that I may destroy they and blot out their name from under the heaven . I will then make of you a nation mightier and great than they .     when I have come down again from the blazing , fiery mountain , with the two tablet of the covenant in both my hand ,        I see how you have sin against the   Lord , your God , by make for yourself a molten calf . you have already turn aside from the way which the   Lord   have command you .        I take hold of the two tablet and with both hand cast they from I and break they before your eye .        then , as before , I lay prostrate before the   Lord   for forty day and forty night ; I eat no food , I drink no water , because of all the sin you have commit in the sight of the   Lord , do wrong and provoke he .        for I dread the fierce anger of the   Lord   against you : his wrath would destroy you .    yet once again the   Lord   listen to I .      with Aaron , too , the   Lord   be deeply angry , and would have destroy he ; but I pray for Aaron also at that time .        then , take the calf , the sinful object you have make , I burn it and grind it down to powder as fine as dust , which I throw into the wadi that go down the mountainside .      at Taberah , at Massah , and at Kibroth - hattaavah likewise , you enrage the   Lord .        and when the   Lord   send you up from Kadesh - barnea say , go up and take possession of the land I have give you , you rebel against this command of the   Lord , your God , and would not believe he or listen to his voice .        you have be rebel against the   Lord   from the day I first know you .      those forty day , then , and forty night , I lay prostrate before the   Lord , because he have threaten to destroy you .      and I pray to the Lord and say : o Lord   God , do not destroy your people , the heritage you redeem in your greatness and have bring out of Egypt with your strong hand .        remember your servant , Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob . do not look upon the stubbornness of this people nor upon their wickedness and sin ,        lest the land from which you have bring we say , the   Lord   be not able to bring they into the land he promise they , and out of hatred for they , he bring they out to let they die in the wilderness .        they be your people and your heritage , whom you have bring out by your great power and with your outstretched arm .
