b '   the Divine Power and Mercy    He who lives forever create the whole universe ;    the   Lord   alone be just .    to whom have he give power to describe his work ,   and who can search out his mighty deed ?   who can measure his majestic power ,   or fully recount his mercy ?   no one can lessen , increase ,   or fathom the wonder of the Lord .   when mortal finish , they be only begin ,   and when they stop they be still bewildered .   what be mortal ? what be they worth ?   what be good in they , and what be evil ?   the number of their day seem great   if it reach a hundred year .    like a drop of water from the sea and a grain of sand ,   so be these few year among the day of eternity .   that be why the Lord be patient with they   and pour out his mercy on they .   he see and understand that their death be wretched ,   and so he forgive they all the more .   their compassion be for their neighbor ,   but the Lords compassion reach all flesh , Reproving , admonish , teaching ,   and turn they back , as a shepherd his flock .    he have compassion on those who accept his discipline ,   who be eager for his precept .    the need for Prudence   my child , add no reproach to your charity ,    or spoil any gift by harsh word .   do not the dew give relief from the scorch heat ?   so a word can be well than a gift .   indeed do not a word count more than a good gift ?   but both be offer by a kind person .   the fool be ungracious and abusive ,   and a grudging gift make the eye smart .      before you speak , learn ;   before you get sick , prepare the cure .   before you be judge , examine yourself ,   and at the time of scrutiny you will have forgiveness .   before you fall ill , humble yourself ;   and when you have sin , show repentance .   do not delay forsake your sin ;   do not neglect to do so until you be in distress .     let nothing prevent the prompt payment of your vow ;   do not wait until death to fulfill they .    before make a vow prepare yourself ;   do not be like one who put the Lord to the test .   think of wrath on the day of death ,   the time of vengeance when he will hide his face .    think of the time of hunger in the time of plenty ,   poverty and need in the day of wealth .    between morning and evening there be a change of time ;   before the Lord all thing be fleeting .     the wise be discreet in all thing ;   where sin be rife they keep themselves from wrongdoing .   every wise person teach wisdom ,    and those who know she declare her praise ;   those skilled in word become wise themselves ,   and pour forth apt proverb .    Self - Control    do not let your passion be your guide ,    but keep your desire in check .   if you allow yourself to satisfy your passion ,   they will make you the laughingstock of your enemy .   take no pleasure in too much luxury   which bring on poverty redouble .   do not become a glutton and a drunkard   with nothing in your purse .
