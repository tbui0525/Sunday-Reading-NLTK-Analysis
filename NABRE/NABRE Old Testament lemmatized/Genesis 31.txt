b '   Flight from Laban .      Jacob hear that Labans son be say , Jacob have take everything that belong to our father , and he have produce all this wealth from our father property .      Jacob perceive , too , that Labans attitude toward he be not what it have previously be .      then the   Lord   say to Jacob : return to the land of your ancestor , where you be bear , and I will be with you .      so Jacob send for Rachel and Leah to meet he in the field where his flock be .      there he say to they : I have notice that your father attitude toward I be not as it be in the past ; but the God of my father have be with I .      you know well that with all my strength I serve your father ;      yet your father cheat I and change my wage ten time . God , however , do not let he do I any harm .        whenever your father say , the speckled animal will be your wage , the entire flock would bear speckle young ; whenever he say , the streaked animal will be your wage , the entire flock would bear streak young .      so God take away your father livestock and give it to I .      once , during the flock mate season , I have a dream in which I see he - goat mating that be streaked , speckled and mottled .      in the dream Gods angel say to I , Jacob ! and I reply , here I be !      then he say : look up and see . all the he - goat that be mate be streaked , speckled and mottled , for I have see all the thing that Laban have be do to you .      I be the God of Bethel , where you anoint a sacred pillar and make a vow to I . get up now ! leave this land and return to the land of your birth .      Rachel and Leah answer he : do we still have an heirs portion in our father house ?      be we not regard by he as outsider ?    he not only sell we ; he have even use up the money that he get for we !      all the wealth that God take away from our father really belong to we and our child . so do whatever God have tell you .        Jacob proceed to put his child and wife on camel ,      and he drive off all his livestock and all the property he have acquire in Paddan - aram , to go to his father Isaac in the land of Canaan .     now Laban be away shear his sheep , and Rachel have steal her father household image .         Jacob have hoodwink    Laban the Aramean by not tell he that he be go to flee .      thus he flee with all that he have . once he be across the Euphrates , he head for the hill country of Gilead .     on the third day , word come to Laban that Jacob have flee .      take his kinsman with he , he pursue he for seven day    until he catch up with he in the hill country of Gilead .      but that night God appear to Laban the Aramean in a dream and say to he : take care not to say anything to Jacob .     Jacob and Laban in Gilead .     when Laban overtake Jacob , Jacobs tent be pitch in the hill country ; Laban also pitch his tent in the hill country of Gilead .      Laban say to Jacob , how could you hoodwink I and carry off my daughter like prisoner of war ?        why do you dupe I by steal away secretly ? you do not tell I ! I would have send you off with joyful singing to the sound of tambourine and harp .      you do not even allow I a parting kiss to my daughter and grandchild ! now what you have do make no sense .      I have it in my power to harm all of you ; but last night the God of your father say to I , take care not to say anything to Jacob !      grant that you have to leave because you be long for your father house , why do you steal my god ?      Jacob reply to Laban , I be frightened at the thought that you might take your daughter away from I by force .      as for your god , the one you find they with shall not remain alive ! if , with our kinsman look on , you identify anything here as belong to you , take it . Jacob have no idea that Rachel have steal the household image .     Laban then go in and search Jacobs tent and Leahs tent , as well as the tent of the two maidservant ; but he do not find they . leave Leahs tent , he go into Rachels .       meanwhile Rachel have take the household image , put they inside the camel saddlebag , and seat herself upon they . when Laban have rummage through her whole tent without find they ,        she say to her father , do not let my lord be angry that I can not rise in your presence ; I be have my period . so , despite his search , he do not find the household image .     Jacob , now anger , confront Laban and demand , what crime or offense have I commit that you should hound I ?      now that you have rummage through all my thing , what have you find from your household belonging ? produce it here before your kinsman and mine , and let they decide between the two of we .     in the twenty year that I be under you , no ewe or she - goat of yours ever miscarry , and I have never eat ram of your flock .       I never bring you an animal tear by wild beast ; I make good the loss myself . you hold I responsible for anything steal by day or night .        often the scorch heat devour I by day , and the frost by night , while sleep flee from my eye !      of the twenty year that I have now spend in your household , I serve you fourteen year for your two daughter and six year for your flock , while you change my wage ten time .      if the God of my father , the God of Abraham and the Fear of Isaac , have not be on my side , you would now have send I away empty - handed . but God see my plight and the fruit of my toil , and last night he reproach you .       Laban reply to Jacob : the daughter be mine , their child be mine , and the flock be mine ; everything you see belong to I . what can I do now for my own daughter and for the child they have bear ?       come , now , let we make a covenant , you and I ; and it will be a treaty between you and I .     then Jacob take a stone and set it up as a sacred pillar .        Jacob say to his kinsman , Gather stone . so they get stone and make a mound ; and they eat there at the mound .      Laban call it Jegar - sahadutha ,    but Jacob call it Galeed .      Laban say , this mound will be a witness from now on between you and I . that be why it be name Galeed\xe2\x80\x94      and also Mizpah ,    for he say : may the   Lord   keep watch between you and I when we be out of each other sight .      if you mistreat my daughter , or take other wife besides my daughter , know that even though no one else be there , God will be a witness between you and I .     Laban say far to Jacob : here be this mound , and here be the sacred pillar that I have set up between you and I .      this mound will be a witness , and this sacred pillar will be a witness , that , with hostile intent , I may not pass beyond this mound into your territory , nor may you pass beyond it into mine .      may the God of Abraham and the God of Nahor , the God of their father , judge between we ! Jacob take the oath by the Fear of his father Isaac .        he then offer a sacrifice on the mountain and invite his kinsman to share in the meal . when they have eat , they pass the night on the mountain .
