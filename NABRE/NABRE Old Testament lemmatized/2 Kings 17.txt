b '   reign of Hoshea of Israel .     in the twelfth year of Ahaz , king of Judah , Hoshea , son of Elah , become king in Samaria over Israel for nine year .     he do what be evil in the   Lord s sight , yet not to the extent of the king of Israel before he .      Shalmaneser ,    king of Assyria , advance against he , and Hoshea become his vassal and pay he tribute .        but the king of Assyria find Hoshea guilty of conspiracy for send messenger to the king of Egypt at Sais , and for failure to pay the annual tribute to the king of Assyria . so the king of Assyria arrest and imprison he .      then the king of Assyria    occupy the whole land and attack Samaria , which he besiege for three year .    Israelites deport .     in Hosheas ninth year , the king of Assyria take Samaria , deport the Israelites to Assyria , and settle they in Halah , and at the Habor , a river of Gozan , and in the city of the Medes .        this come about because the Israelites sin against the   Lord , their God , who have bring they up from the land of Egypt , from under the hand of Pharaoh , king of Egypt . they venerate other god ,       they follow the rite of the nation whom the   Lord   have dispossess before the Israelites and those that the king of Israel have practice .      they adopt unlawful practice toward the   Lord , their God . they build high place in all their city , from guard post to garrisoned town .      they set up pillar and asherah    for themselves on every high hill and under every green tree .      they burn incense there , on all the high place , like the nation whom the   Lord   have send into exile at their coming . they do evil thing that provoke the   Lord ,      and serve idol , although the   Lord   have tell they : you must not do this .      the   Lord   warn Israel and Judah by every prophet and seer : give up your evil way and keep my commandment and statute , in accordance with the entire law which I enjoin on your ancestor and which I send you by my servant the prophet .      but they do not listen . they grow as stiff - necked as their ancestor , who have not believe in the   Lord , their God .        they reject his statute , the covenant he have make with their ancestor , and the warning he have give they . they follow emptiness and become empty ; they follow the surround nation whom the   Lord   have command they not to imitate .        they abandon all the commandment of the   Lord , their God : they make for themselves two molten calf ; they make an asherah ; they bow down to all the host of heaven ; they serve Baal .         they immolate their son and daughter by fire . they practice augury and divination . they surrender themselves to do what be evil in the   Lord s sight , and provoke he .      the   Lord   become enraged , and remove they from his presence . only the tribe of Judah be leave .      even the people of Judah do not keep the commandment of the   Lord , their God , but follow the rite practice by Israel .      so the   Lord   reject the entire people of Israel : he afflict they and deliver they over to plunderer , finally cast they from his presence .        when he tear Israel away from the house of David , they make Jeroboam , son of Nebat , king ; but Jeroboam lure the Israelites away from the   Lord , cause they to commit a great sin .        the Israelites imitate Jeroboam in all the sin he commit ; they would not depart from they .     finally , the   Lord   remove Israel from his presence , just as he have declare through all his servant , the prophet . thus Israel go into exile from their native soil to Assyria until this very day .    foreigner deport to Israel .     the king of Assyria bring people from Babylon , Cuthah , Avva , Hamath , and Sepharvaim , and settle they in the city of Samaria in place of the Israelites . they take possession of Samaria and dwelt in its city .      when they first settle there , they do not venerate the   Lord , so he send lion among they that kill some of they .      a report reach the king of Assyria : the nation you deport and settle in the city of Samaria do not know the proper worship of the god of the land , so he have send lion among they that be kill they , since they do not know the law of the god of the land .      the king of Assyria give the order , send back some of the priest you deport , to go there and settle , to teach they the proper worship of the god of the land .      so one of the priest who have be deport from Samaria return and settle in Bethel , and begin to teach they how to venerate the   Lord .     thus each of these nation continue to make its own god , set they up in the shrine of the high place the Samarians have make : each nation in the city in which they dwelt .      the Babylonians make Sukkot - Benot ;    the people of Cuth make Nergal ; those from Hamath make Ashima ;      those from Avva make Nibhaz and Tartak ; and those from Sepharvaim immolate their child by fire to their city god , King Hadad and King Anu .      at the same time , they be venerate the   Lord , appoint from their own number priest for the high place to officiate for they in the shrine on the high place .      they be both venerate the   Lord   and serve their own god . they follow the custom of the nation from among whom they have be deport .     to this very day they continue to act accord to their former custom , not venerate the   Lord   nor observe the statute and regulation , the law and commandment , that the   Lord   enjoin on the descendant of Jacob , whom he have name Israel .        when the   Lord   make a covenant with they , he command they : you must not venerate other god , nor bow down to they , nor serve they , nor offer sacrifice to they ,        but only to the   Lord , who bring you up from the land of Egypt with great power and outstretched arm . he shall you venerate , to he shall you bow down , and to he shall you offer sacrifice .      you must be careful always to observe the statute and ordinance , the law and commandment , which he write for you ; you must not venerate other god .      the covenant I make with you , you must not forget ; you must not venerate other god .      you must venerate only the   Lord , your God ; it be he who will deliver you from the power of all your enemy .      but they do not listen ; they continue to act accord to their former custom .     but these nation be both venerate the   Lord   and serve their own idol . their child and children child be still act like their ancestor , to this very day .
