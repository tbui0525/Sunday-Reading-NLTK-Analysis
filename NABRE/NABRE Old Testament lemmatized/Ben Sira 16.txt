b '   Gods punishment of sinner    do not yearn for worthless child ,   or rejoice in wicked offspring .   even if they be many , do not rejoice in they   if they do not have fear of the   Lord .   do not count on long life for they ,    or have any hope for their future . for one can be well than a thousand ;   rather die childless than have impious child !   through one wise person a city can be people ;   but through a clan of rebel it become desolate .     many such thing my eye have see ,   and even more than these my ear have hear .   against a sinful band fire be kindle ,    upon a godless people wrath blaze .    he do not forgive the prince of old    who rebel long ago in their might .    he do not spare the neighbor of Lot ,     abominable in their pride .   he do not spare the doomed people ,    dispossess because of their sin ;   nor the six hundred thousand foot soldier ,     send to their grave for the arrogance of their heart .   have there be but one stiff - necked    person ,   it would be a wonder have he go unpunished . for mercy and anger alike be with he ;   he remit and forgive , but also pour out wrath .   great as his mercy be his punishment ;   he judge people , each accord to their deed .   criminal do not escape with their plunder ;   the hope of the righteous , God never leave unfulfilled .   whoever do good have a reward ;   each receive accord to their deed .      do not say : I be hide from God ;   and on high who remember I ? among so many people I be unknown ;   what be I in the world of spirit ?   look , the heaven and the high heaven ,   the abyss and the earth tremble at his visitation .   the root of the mountain and the earth foundations\xe2\x80\x94   at his mere glance they quiver and quake .   of I , therefore , he will take no notice ;   with my way who will be concern ?   if I sin , no eye will see I ;   if all in secret I act deceitfully , who be to know ?    who tell he about just deed ?   what can I expect for do my duty ?   such the thought of the senseless ;   only the foolish entertain they .    Divine wisdom see in Creation    listen to I , my son , and take my advice ,   and apply your mind to my word ,   while I pour out my spirit by measure   and impart knowledge with care .   when at the first God create his work   and , as he make they , assign their task ,    he arrange for all time what they be to do ,   their domain from generation to generation . they be not to go hungry or grow weary ,   or ever cease from their task .   never do a single one crowd its neighbor ,   or do any ever disobey his word .   then the Lord look upon the earth ,   and fill it with his blessing .    its surface he cover with every kind of live creature   which must return into it again .
