b '   David and Jonathan .     by the time David finish speak with Saul , Jonathans life became bind up with Davids life ; he love he as his very self .        Saul retain David on that day and do not allow he to return to his father house .        Jonathan and David make a covenant , because Jonathan love he as his very self .      Jonathan take off    the cloak he be wear and hand it over to David , along with his military dress , even his sword , bow , and belt .        David then carry out successfully every mission on which Saul send he . so Saul put he in charge of his soldier ; this meet with the approval of the whole army , even Sauls officer .    Sauls Jealousy .     at the approach of Saul and David , on Davids return after strike down the Philistine , woman come out from all the city of Israel to meet Saul the king , singe and dancing , with tambourine , joyful song , and stringed instrument .         the woman play and sing : Saul have slay his thousand ,   David his ten of thousand .      Saul be very angry and resentful of the song , for he think : they give David ten of thousand , but only thousand to I . all that remain for he be the kingship .      from that day on , Saul keep a jealous eye on David .      the next day an evil spirit from God rush upon Saul , and he rage in his house . David be in attendance , play the harp as at other time , while Saul be hold his spear .      Saul poise the spear , think , I will nail David to the wall ! but twice David escape he .      Saul then begin to fear David because the   Lord   be with he but have turn away from Saul .      Saul send he out of his presence and appoint he a field officer . so David lead the people on their military expedition      and prosper in all his way , for the   Lord   be with he .      see how he prosper , Saul fear David .      but all Israel and Judah love David , since he lead they on their expedition .      Saul plot against David .     Saul say to David , look , I will give you my old daughter , Merob , in marriage if you become my warrior and fight the battle of the   Lord . Saul think , I will not lay a hand on he . let the hand of the Philistines strike he .        but David answer Saul : who be I ? and who be my kindred or my father clan in Israel that I should become the king son - in - law ?      but when the time come for Sauls daughter Merob to be give to David , she be give as wife to Adriel the Meholathite instead .      now Sauls daughter Michal love David . when this be report to Saul , he be pleased .        he think , I will offer she to he as a trap , so that the hand of the Philistines may strike he . so for the second time Saul say to David , you shall become my son - in - law today .      Saul then order his servant , speak to David privately and say : the king favor you , and all his officer love you . you should become son - in - law to the king .      but when Sauls servant mention this to David , he say : be become the king son - in - law a trivial matter in your eye ? I be poor and insignificant .      when his servant report Davids answer to he ,      Saul command they , say this to David : the king desire no other price for the bride than the foreskin of one hundred Philistines , that he may thus take vengeance on his enemy . Saul intend to have David fall into the hand of the Philistines .        when the servant report this offer to David , he be pleased with the prospect of become the king son - in - law . before the year be up ,      David arise and go with his man and slew two hundred Philistines . he bring back their foreskin and count they out before the king that he might become the king son - in - law . so Saul give he his daughter Michal as wife .      then Saul realize that the   Lord   be with David and that his own daughter Michal love David .      so Saul fear David all the more and be his enemy ever after .     the philistine chief continue to make foray , but each time they take the field , David be more successful against they than any of Sauls other officer , and his name be hold in great esteem .
