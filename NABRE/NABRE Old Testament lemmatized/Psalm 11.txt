b ' confidence in the Presence of God   for the leader . of David . I in the   Lord   I take refuge ;   how can you say to I ,   Flee like a bird to the mountain !    see how the wicked string their bow ,   fit their arrow to the string   to shoot from the shadow at the upright of heart .     if foundation be destroy ,   what can the just one do ?    II   the   Lord   be in his holy temple ;   the   Lord s throne be in heaven .   god eye keep careful watch ;   they test the child of Adam .   the   Lord   test the righteous and the wicked ,   hate those who love violence ,   and rain upon the wicked   fiery coal and brimstone ,   a scorching wind their allot cup .     the   Lord   be just and love just deed ;   the upright will see his face .
