b '   parable of the Shepherds .     the word of the   Lord   come to I :      Son of man , prophesy against the shepherd    of Israel . Prophesy and say to they : to the shepherd , thus say the Lord   God : woe to the shepherd of Israel who have be pasture themselves !    should not shepherd pasture the flock ?      you consume milk , wear wool , and slaughter fatling , but the flock you do not pasture .        you do not strengthen the weak nor heal the sick nor bind up the injure . you do not bring back the stray or seek the lose but rule they harshly and brutally .        so they be scatter for lack of a shepherd , and become food for all the wild beast . they be scatter        and wander over all the mountain and high hill ; over the entire surface of the earth my sheep be scatter . no one look after they or search for they .     therefore , shepherd , hear the word of the   Lord :      as I live\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the Lord   God \xe2\x80\x94because my sheep become plunder , because my sheep become food for wild beast , for lack of a shepherd , because my shepherd do not look after my sheep , but pasture themselves and do not pasture my sheep ,        therefore , shepherd , hear the word of the   Lord :      thus say the Lord   God : look ! I be come against these shepherd . I will take my sheep out of their hand and put a stop to their shepherd my flock , so that these shepherd will no long pasture they . I will deliver my flock from their mouth so it will not become their food .      for thus say the Lord   God : look ! I myself will search for my sheep and examine they .      as a shepherd examine his flock while he himself be among his scatter sheep , so will I examine my sheep . I will deliver they from every place where they be scatter on the day of dark cloud .        I will lead they out from among the people and gather they from the land ; I will bring they back to their own country and pasture they upon the mountain of Israel , in the ravine and every inhabit place in the land .        in good pasture I will pasture they ; on the mountain height of Israel will be their grazing land . there they will lie down on good grazing ground ; in rich pasture they will be pasture on the mountain of Israel .        I myself will pasture my sheep ; I myself will give they rest\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the Lord   God .      the lost I will search out , the stray I will bring back , the injured I will bind up , and the sick I will heal ; but the sleek and the strong I will destroy . I will shepherd they in judgment .    separation of the Sheep .     as for you , my flock , thus say the Lord   God : I will judge between one sheep and another , between ram and goat .        be it not enough for you to graze on the good pasture , that you have to trample the rest of your pasture with your hoof ? or to drink the clear water , that you have to pollute the rest with your hoof ?      thus my flock have to graze on what your hoof have trample and drink what your hoof have pollute .      therefore thus say the Lord   God : now I will judge between the fat and the lean .      because you push with flank and shoulder , and butt all the weak sheep with your horn until you drive they off ,      I will save my flock so they can no long be plunder ; I will judge between one sheep and another .       I will appoint one shepherd    over they to pasture they , my servant David ; he shall pasture they and be their shepherd .      I , the   Lord , will be their God , and my servant David will be prince in their midst . I , the   Lord , have speak .      I will make a covenant of peace with they and rid the country of wild beast so they will dwell securely in the wilderness and sleep in the forest .        I will settle they around my hill and send rain in its season , the blessing of abundant rain .      the tree of the field shall bear their fruit , and the land its crop , and they shall dwell securely on their own soil . they shall know that I be the   Lord   when I break the bar of their yoke and deliver they from the power of those who enslave they .        they shall no long be plunder by the nation nor will wild beast devour they , but they shall dwell securely , with no one to frighten they .        I will prepare for they peaceful field for plant so they be never again sweep away by famine in the land or bear taunt from the nation .      thus they shall know that I , the   Lord , their God , be with they , and that they be my people , the house of Israel\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the Lord   God .        yes , you be my flock : you people be the flock of my pasture , and I be your god\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the Lord   God .
