b ' ii . Israels Guilt , punishment , and Restoration   Indictment of Israel    hear the word of the   Lord , Israelites ,   for the   Lord   have a dispute   with the inhabitant of the land :   there be no fidelity , no loyalty ,   no knowledge of God in the land .   swear , lying , murder ,   stealing and adultery break out ;    bloodshed follow bloodshed .    therefore the land dry up ,   and everything that dwell in it languish : the beast of the field ,   the bird of the air ,   and even the fish of the sea perish .     guilt of Priest and of People   but let no one accuse , let no one rebuke ;   with you be my dispute , priest !    you will stumble in the day ,   and the prophet will stumble with you at night ;   I will make an end of your mother .    my people be ruin for lack of knowledge !   since you have reject knowledge ,   I will reject you from serve as my priest ; since you have forget the law of your God ,   I will also forget your child .     the more they multiply , the more they sin against I ,   I will change their glory    into shame .    they feed on the sin of my people ,   and be greedy for their iniquity .    like people , like priest :    I will punish they for their way ,   and repay they for their deed .   they will eat but not be satisfied ,    they will promote prostitution    but not increase , because they have abandon the   Lord ,   devote themselves    to prostitution . aged wine and new wine   take away understanding .    my people consult their piece of wood ,    and their wand make pronouncement for they , for the spirit of prostitution have lead they astray ;   they prostitute themselves , forsake their God .   on the mountaintop they offer sacrifice   and on the hill they burn incense , beneath oak and poplar and terebinth ,   because of their pleasant shade .   therefore your daughter prostitute themselves ,   and your daughter - in - law commit adultery .   I will not punish your daughter for their prostitution ,   nor your daughter - in - law for their adultery , because the man themselves consort with prostitute ,   and with temple woman    they offer sacrifice ! thus a people without understanding come to ruin .     though you prostitute yourself , Israel ,   do not let Judah become guilty ! do not come to Gilgal ,    do not go up to Beth - aven ,    do not swear , as the Lord live !    for like a stubborn cow ,   Israel be stubborn ; will the   Lord   now pasture they ,   like lamb in a broad meadow ?   Ephraim    be bind to idol ,   let he alone !    when their drinking be over ,   they give themselves to prostitution ;    they love shame more than their honor .   a wind    have bind they up in its wing ;    they shall be ashamed because of their altar .
