b '   the blessing of Wisdom    my son , if you receive my word   and treasure my command ,   turn your ear to wisdom ,    incline your heart to understanding ;   yes , if you call for intelligence ,   and to understanding raise your voice ;   if you seek she like silver ,   and like hidden treasure search she out ,   then will you understand the fear of the   Lord ;   the knowledge of God you will find ;   for the   Lord   give wisdom ,   from his mouth come knowledge and understanding ;    he have success in store for the upright ,   be the shield of those who walk honestly ,   guard the path of justice ,   protect the way of his faithful one ,   then you will understand what be right and just ,   what be fair , every good path ;   for wisdom will enter your heart ,   knowledge will be at home in your soul ,   Discretion will watch over you ,   understanding will guard you ;    save you from the way of the wicked ,   from those whose speech be perverse .   from those who have leave the straight path   to walk in the way of darkness ,   who delight in do evil   and celebrate perversity ;   whose way be crooked ,   whose path be devious ;    save you from a stranger ,   from a foreign woman with her smooth word ,    one who forsake the companion of her youth   and forget the covenant of her God ;   for her path sink down to death ,   and her footstep lead to the shade .     none who enter there come back ,   or gain the path of life .   thus you may walk in the way of the good ,   and keep to the path of the just .    for the upright will dwell in the land ,    people of integrity will remain in it ;   but the wicked will be cut off from the land ,   the faithless will be root out of it .
