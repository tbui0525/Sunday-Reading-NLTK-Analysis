b '   Israels Deliverance    the wilderness and the parched land will exult ;   the Arabah will rejoice and bloom ;    like the crocus it shall bloom abundantly ,   and rejoice with joyful song . the glory of Lebanon will be give to it ,   the splendor of Carmel and Sharon ; they will see the glory of the   Lord ,   the splendor of our God .    strengthen hand that be feeble ,   make firm knee that be weak ,    say to the fearful of heart :   be strong , do not fear ! here be your God ,   he come with vindication ; with divine recompense   he come to save you .    then the eye of the blind shall see ,   and the ear of the deaf be open ;    then the lame shall leap like a stag ,   and the mute tongue sing for joy . for water will burst forth in the wilderness ,   and stream in the Arabah .    the burn sand will become pool ,   and the thirsty ground , spring of water ; the abode where jackal crouch   will be a marsh for the reed and papyrus .   a highway will be there ,   call the holy way ; no one unclean may pass over it ,   but it will be for his people ;   no traveler , not even fool , shall go astray on it .    no lion shall be there ,   nor any beast of prey approach ,   nor be find .   but there the redeemed shall walk ,    and the ransom of the   Lord   shall return ,   and enter Zion singing ,   crown with everlasting joy ; they meet with joy and gladness ,   sorrow and mourning flee away .
