b '   the second Oracle against Babylon    thus say the   Lord : see ! I rouse against Babylon ,   and the inhabitant of Chaldea ,   a destroyer wind .    to Babylon I will send winnower   to winnow and lie waste the land ; they shall besiege it on every side   on the day of affliction .    how can the archer draw back their bow ,   lift their armor ? do not spare her young man ,   put the entire army under the ban .    the slain shall fall in the land of Chaldea ,   the wound , in its street ;    for Israel and Judah be not leave widow   by their God , the   Lord   of host , even though the land be full of guilt   against the Holy One of Israel .   Flee from Babylon ;   each of you save your own life ,   do not perish because of her guilt ; this be a time of retribution from the   Lord ,    who pay out her due .   Babylon be a golden cup in the hand of the   Lord   make the whole earth drunk ; the nation drink its wine ,   thus they have go mad .    Babylon suddenly fall and be break :   wail over she ! bring balm for her wound ,   in case she can be heal .    we have try to heal Babylon ,   but she can not be heal .   leave she , each of we must go to our own land . the judgment against her reach the heaven ,   it touch the cloud .    the   Lord   have bring forth our vindication ;   come , let we tell in Zion   what the   Lord , our God , have do .    sharpen the arrow ,   fill the quiver ; the   Lord   have stir up the spirit of the king of the Medes ,    for his resolve be babylon destruction . yes , it be retribution from the   Lord ,   retribution for his temple .    over the wall of Babylon raise a signal ,   reinforce the watch ; Post sentry ,   arrange ambush ! for the   Lord   have both plan and carry out   what he speak against the inhabitant of Babylon .   you who dwell by mighty water ,   rich in treasure , your end have come ,   the time at which you shall be cut off !    the   Lord   of host have swear by himself :   I will fill you with people as numerous as locust ,   who shall raise over you a joyous shout !   he make the earth by his power ,   establish the world by wisdom ,   and by his skill stretch out the heavens .    when he thunder , the water in the heavens roar ,   he summon cloud from the end of the earth , make lightning flash in the rain ,   and bring out wind from their storehouse .   every man be stupid , ignorant ;   every artisan be put to shame by his idol : he mold a fraud ,   without life - breath .   they be nothing , a ridiculous work ,   that will perish at the time of punishment .   Jacobs portion be nothing like they :   he be the creator of all thing . Israel be his very own tribe ;   Lord   of host be his name .   you be my hammer ,   a weapon for war ; with you I shatter nation ,   with you I destroy kingdom .   with you I shatter horse and rider ,   with you I shatter chariot and driver .    with you I shatter man and woman ,   with you I shatter old and young ,   with you I shatter the young man and young woman .    with you I shatter shepherd and flock ,   with you I shatter farmer and team ,   with you I shatter governor and officer .   thus I will repay Babylon ,   all the inhabitant of Chaldea , for all the evil they commit against Zion ,   before your very eyes\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord .    Beware ! I be against you ,   destroy mountain\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord \xe2\x80\x94   destroyer of the entire earth , I will stretch forth my hand against you ,   roll you down over the cliff ,   and make you a burn mountain :    they will not take from you a cornerstone ,   or a foundation stone ; you shall remain ruin forever\xe2\x80\x94   oracle of the   Lord .    raise a signal in the land ,   sound the trumpet among the nation ; dedicate nation for war against she ,   summon against she the kingdom :   Ararat , Minni , and Ashkenaz ;   appoint a recruit officer against she ,   dispatch horse like bristle locust .    dedicate nation for war against she :   the king of the Medes , its governor and all its officer ,   every land in its domain .   the earth quake and writhe ,   the   Lord s plan against Babylon be carry out , turn the land of Babylon   into a wasteland without inhabitant .   babylon warrior have cease to fight ,   they remain in their stronghold ; dry up be their strength ,   they have become woman . burn down be their home ,   break their gate .   one runner meet another ,   herald meet herald , tell the king of Babylon   that his entire city have be take .    the ford have be seize ,   marsh set on fire ,   warrior panic .     for thus say the   Lord   of host , the God of Israel : Daughter Babylon be like a threshing floor   at the time of treading ; yet a little while ,   and the harvest time will come for she .    he consume I , defeat I ,   Nebuchadnezzar , king of Babylon ;   he leave I like an empty vessel , swallow I like a sea monster ,   fill his belly with my delicacy and cast I out .   let my torn flesh be visit upon Babylon ,   say enthrone Zion ; my blood upon the inhabitant of Chaldea ,   say Jerusalem .   but now , thus say the   Lord : I will certainly defend your cause ,   I will certainly avenge you ; I will dry up her sea ,   and drain her fountain .   Babylon shall become a heap of ruin ,   a haunt of jackal ; a place of horror and hiss ,   without inhabitant .    they roar like lion ,   growl like lion cub .    when they be parch , I will set drink before they   to make they drunk , that they may be overcome   with everlasting sleep , never to awaken\xe2\x80\x94   oracle of the   Lord .   I will bring they down like lamb to slaughter ,   like ram and goat .   how she have be seize , take captive ,   the glory of the whole world ! what a horror Babylon have become among the nation :     against Babylon the sea rise ,   she be overwhelmed by roar wave !   her city have become wasteland ,   a parched and arid land where no one live ,   no one pass through .   I will punish Bel in Babylon ,   and make he vomit up what he swallow ;   nation shall no long stream to he . even the wall of Babylon fall !    leave she , my people ; each of you save your own life   from the burn wrath of the   Lord .     do not be discourage when rumor spread through the land ; this year one rumor come , next year another : violence in the land ! or ruler against ruler !        realize that the day be come when I will punish the idol of Babylon ; the whole land shall be put to shame , all her slain shall fall in her midst .      then heaven and earth and everything in they shall shout over Babylon with joy , when the destroyer come against she from the north\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord .        Babylon , too , must fall , you slay of Israel , because by the hand of Babylon the slain of all the earth have fall .     you who have escape the sword ,   go , do not stand idle ; remember the   Lord   from far away ,   let Jerusalem come to mind .   we be ashamed because we have hear taunt ,   disgrace cover our face ;   stranger have enter sanctuary in the   Lord s house .    therefore see , the day be coming\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord \xe2\x80\x94   when I will punish her idol ,   and throughout the land the wound will groan .   though Babylon scale the heavens ,   and make her strong height inaccessible ,   my destroyer shall reach her\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord .    a sound of cry from Babylon ,   great destruction from the land of the Chaldeans ;   for the   Lord   lay Babylon waste ,   silence her loud cry , wave roar like mighty water ,   a clamor resounding .   for the destroyer come upon she , upon Babylon ;   warrior be capture , their bow break ; the   Lord   be a God of recompense ,   he will surely repay .      I will make her prince and sage drunk , with her governor , officer , and warrior , so that they sleep an everlasting sleep , never to awaken\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the King , whose name be   Lord   of host .      thus say the   Lord   of host : the wall of spacious Babylon shall be level to the ground ,   its lofty gate destroy by fire . the toil of the people be for nothing ;   the nation weary themselves for what the flame consume .     the Prophecy send to Babylon .     the mission Jeremiah the prophet give to Seraiah ,    son of Neriah , son of Mahseiah , when he go to Babylon with King Zedekiah , king of Judah , in the fourth year of his reign ; Seraiah be chief quartermaster .      Jeremiah write down on one scroll the disaster that would befall Babylon ;    all these word be write against Babylon .      and Jeremiah say to Seraiah : when you reach Babylon , see that you read all these word aloud ,        and then say :   Lord , you yourself speak against this place in order to cut it down so that nothing , human being or beast , could live in it , because it be to remain a wasteland forever .      when you have finish read this scroll , tie a stone to it and throw it into the Euphrates ,        and say : thus Babylon shall sink . it will never rise , because of the disaster I be bring upon it . thus far the word of Jeremiah .
