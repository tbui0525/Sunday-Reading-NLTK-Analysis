I have deliver the king of Ai into your power , with his people , city , and land .      do to Ai and its king what you do to Jericho and its king\xe2\x80\x94except that you may take its spoil and livestock as plunder .    set an ambush behind the city .      so Joshua and all the soldier prepare to attack Ai . pick out thirty thousand warrior ,    Joshua send they off by night      with these order : see that you ambush the city from the rear . do not be very far from the city . all of you must be ready .      the rest of the people and I will come up to the city , and when they make a sortie against we as they do the last time , we will flee from they .      they will keep come out after we until we have draw they away from the city , for they will think , they be flee from we as they do the last time . when we flee ,      then you rise from ambush and take possession of the city , which the   Lord , your God , will deliver into your power .      when you have take the city , set it on fire in obedience to the   Lord s command . these be my order to you .        then Joshua send they away . they go to the place of ambush , take up their position to the west of Ai , toward Bethel . Joshua , however , spend that night with the army .     early the next morning Joshua muster the army and go up to Ai at its head , with the elder of Israel .      when all the troop he lead be draw up in position before the city , they pitch camp north of Ai , on the other side of the ravine .      he take about five thousand warrior and set they in ambush between Bethel and Ai , west of the city .      thus the people take up their station , with the main body north of the city and the ambush west of it , and Joshua wait overnight in the valley .      the king of Ai see this , and he and all his army come out very early in the morning to engage Israel in battle at the place in front of the Arabah , not know that there be an ambush behind the city .      Joshua and the main body of the Israelites flee toward the wilderness , pretend defeat ,      until the last of the soldier in the city have be call out to pursue they . since they be draw away from the city , with everyone pursue Joshua ,      not a soldier remain in Ai or Bethel . they abandon the city , leave it open , as they pursue Israel .     then the   Lord   direct Joshua : stretch out the javelin in your hand toward Ai , for I will deliver it into your power . Joshua stretch out the javelin in his hand toward the city ,      and as soon as he do so , the man in ambush rise from their post , rush in , capture the city , and immediately set it on fire .      by the time the army of Ai look back , the smoke from the city be go up to the heaven . escape in any direction be impossible , because the Israelites retreat toward the wilderness now turn on their pursuer ;      for when Joshua and the main body of Israelites see that the city have be take by ambush and be go up in smoke , they strike back at the force of Ai .      since those in the city come out to intercept they , Ais army be hem in by Israelites on both side , who cut they down without any fugitive or survivor        except the king , whom they take alive and bring to Joshua .     when Israel finish kill all the inhabitant of Ai in the open , who have pursue they into the wilderness , and all of they to the last man fall by the sword , then all Israel return and put to the sword those inside the city .      there fall that day a total of twelve thousand man and woman , the entire population of Ai .       Joshua keep the javelin in his hand stretch out until he have carry out the ban on all the inhabitant of Ai .      however , the Israelites take for themselves as plunder the livestock and the spoil of that city , accord to the command of the   Lord   issue to Joshua .      then Joshua destroy Ai by fire , reduce it to an everlasting mound of ruin , as it remain today .        he have the king of Ai hang on a tree until evening ;    then at sunset Joshua order the body remove from the tree and cast at the entrance of the city gate , where a great heap of stone be pile up over it , which remain to the present day .    Altar on Mount Ebal .       later , on Mount Ebal , Joshua build to the   Lord , the God of Israel , an altar      of unhewn stone on which no iron tool have be use ,    just as Moses , the servant of the   Lord , have command the Israelites , as record in the book of the law . on this altar they sacrifice burn offering to the   Lord   and make communion sacrifice .      there , in the presence of the Israelites , Joshua inscribe upon the stone a copy of the law write by Moses .      and all Israel , resident alien and native alike , with their elder , officer , and judge , stand on either side of the ark face the levitical priest who be carry the ark of the covenant of the   Lord .    half of they be face Mount Gerizim and half Mount Ebal , just as Moses , the servant of the   Lord , have first command for the blessing of the people of Israel .       then be read aloud all the word of the law , the blessing and the curse , exactly as write in the book of the law .       every single word that Moses have command , Joshua read aloud to the entire assembly , include the woman and child , and the resident alien among they .
