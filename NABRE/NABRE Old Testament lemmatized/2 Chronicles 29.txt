b '   Hezekiahs Reforms .      Hezekiah be twenty - five year old when he become king , and he reign twenty - nine year in Jerusalem . his mother name be Abijah , daughter of Zechariah .      he do what be right in the   Lord s sight , just as David his father have do .      in the first month of the first year of his reign , he open the door of the   Lord s house and repair they .        he summon the priest and levite , gather they in the open space to the east ,      and say to they : listen to I , you Levites ! sanctify yourself now and sanctify the house of the   Lord , the God of your ancestor , and clean out the filth from the sanctuary .      our ancestor act treacherously and do what be evil in the eye of the   Lord , our God . they abandon he , turn away their face from the   Lord s dwelling , and turn their back on he .      they also close the door of the vestibule , extinguish the lamp , and fail to burn incense and sacrifice burn offering in the sanctuary to the God of Israel .         therefore the anger of the   Lord   have come upon Judah and Jerusalem ; he have make they an object of terror , horror , and hiss , as you see with your own eye .      for our ancestor fall by the sword , and our son , our daughter , and our wife have be take captive because of this .      now , I intend to make a covenant with the   Lord , the God of Israel , that his burn anger may turn away from we .      my son , do not be negligent any long , for it be you whom the   Lord   have choose to stand before he , to minister to he , to be his minister and to offer incense .     then the Levites arise : Mahath , son of Amasai , and Joel , son of Azariah , of the Kohathites ; of the descendant of Merari : Kish , son of Abdi , and Azariah , son of Jehallel ; of the Gershonites : Joah , son of Zimmah , and Eden , son of Joah ;      of the son of Elizaphan : Shimri and Jeuel ; of the son of Asaph : Zechariah and Mattaniah ;      of the son of Heman : Jehuel and Shimei ; of the son of Jeduthun : Shemiah and Uzziel .      they gather their kinfolk together and sanctify themselves ; then they come as the king have order , in keep with the word of the   Lord , to cleanse the   Lord s house .     the priest enter the interior of the   Lord s house to cleanse it . whatever they find in the   Lord s temple that be unclean they bring out to the court of the   Lord s house , where the Levites take it from they and carry it out to the Wadi Kidron .      they begin the work of consecration on the first day of the first month , and on the eighth day of the month they reach the vestibule of the   Lord ; they consecrate the   Lord s house over an eight - day period , and on the sixteenth day of the first month , they have finish .     then they go inside to King Hezekiah and say : we have cleanse the entire house of the   Lord , the altar for burn offering with all its utensil , and the table for the showbread with all its utensil .      we have restore and consecrate all the article which King Ahaz have throw away during his reign because of his treachery ; they be now before the   Lord s altar .    the Rite of Expiation .     then King Hezekiah hasten to convoke the prince of the city and go up to the   Lord s house .      seven bull , seven ram , seven lamb , and seven he - goat be present as a purification offering for the kingdom , for the sanctuary , and for Judah . Hezekiah order the son of Aaron , the priest , to offer they on the altar of the   Lord .      they slaughter the bull , and the priest collect the blood and splash it on the altar . then they slaughter the ram and splash the blood on the altar ; then they slaughter the lamb and splash the blood on the altar .      then the he - goat for the purification offering be lead before the king and the assembly , who lay their hand upon they .      the priest then slaughter they and offer their blood on the altar to atone for the sin of all Israel . for the king have say , the burn offering and the purification offering be for all Israel .     he station the Levites in the   Lord s house with cymbal , harp , and lyre , accord to the command of David , of Gad the king seer , and of Nathan the prophet ; for this command be from the   Lord   through his prophet .      the Levites be station with the instrument of David , and the priest with the trumpet .      then Hezekiah order the burn offering to be sacrifice on the altar . at the very moment the burn offering begin , they also begin the song of the   Lord , to the accompaniment of the trumpet and the instrument of David , king of Israel .      the entire assembly bow down , and the song be sing and the trumpet sound until the burn offering have be complete .      once the burn offering be complete , the king and all who be with he kneel and worship .      King Hezekiah and the prince then tell the Levites to sing the praise of the   Lord   in the word of David and of Asaph the seer . they sing praise till their joy be full , then fall down and worship .     Hezekiah then say : you have dedicate yourself to the   Lord . approach , and bring forward the sacrifice and thank offering for the house of the   Lord . then the assembly bring forward the sacrifice and thank offering and all their voluntary burn offering .      the number of burn offering that the assembly bring forward be seventy oxen , one hundred ram , and two hundred lamb : all of these as a burn offering to the   Lord .      as consecrate gift there be six hundred oxen and three thousand sheep .      since there be too few priest to skin all the victim for the burn offering , their fellow Levites assist they until the task be complete and the priest have sanctify themselves . the Levites , in fact , be more careful than the priest to sanctify themselves .        the burn offering be indeed many , along with the fat of the communion offering and the libation for the burn offering . thus the service of the house of the   Lord   be re - establish .      Hezekiah and all the people rejoice over what God have re - establish for the people , and at how suddenly this have be do .         '
