b '    therefore you rebuke offender little by little ,   warn they , and remind they of the sin they be commit ,   that they may abandon their wickedness and believe in you , Lord !     for truly , the ancient inhabitant of your holy land ,     whom you hate for deed most odious\xe2\x80\x94   work of sorcery and impious sacrifice ;   these merciless murderer of child ,   devourer of human flesh ,    and initiate engage in a blood ritual ,    and parent who take with their own hand defenseless life ,   you willed to destroy by the hand of our ancestor ,    that the land that be dear of all to you   might receive a worthy colony of Gods servant .    but even these you spare , since they be but mortal   and send wasp as forerunner of your army   that they might exterminate they by degree .      not that you be without power to have the wicked vanquished in battle by the righteous ,   or wipe out at once by terrible beast or by one decisive word ;    but condemn they by degree , you give they space for repentance . you be not unaware that their origin be wicked   and their malice ingrain ,   and that their disposition would never change ;    for they be a people accurse from the beginning . neither out of fear for anyone   do you grant release from their sin .    for who can say to you , what have you do ?   or who can oppose your decree ? or when people perish , who can challenge you , their maker ;   or who can come into your presence to vindicate the unrighteous ?    for neither be there any god besides you who have the care of all ,   that you need show you have not unjustly condemn ;    nor can any king or prince confront you on behalf of those you have punish .      but as you be righteous , you govern all thing righteously ;   you regard it as unworthy of your power   to punish one who have incur no blame .    for your might be the source of righteousness ;   your mastery over all thing make you lenient to all .    for you show your might when the perfection of your power be disbelieve ;   and in those who know you , you rebuke insolence .     but though you be master of might , you judge with clemency ,   and with much lenience you govern we ;   for power , whenever you will , attend you .     you teach your people , by these deed ,    that those who be righteous must be kind ; and you give your child reason to hope   that you would allow they to repent for their sin .   for these be enemy of your servant , doom to death ;   yet , while you punish they with such solicitude and indulgence ,   grant time and opportunity to abandon wickedness ,   with what exactitude you judge your child ,   to whose ancestor you give the swear covenant of goodly promise !    therefore to give we a lesson you punish our enemy with measure deliberation   so that we may think earnestly of your goodness when we judge ,   and , when be judge , we may look for mercy .    Second Example resume   hence those unrighteous who live a life of folly ,   you torment through their own abomination .    for they go far astray in the path of error ,   take for god the worthless and disgusting among beast ,   be deceive like senseless infant .    therefore as though upon unreasone child ,   you send your judgment on they as a mockery ;    but they who take no heed of a punishment which be but child play   be to experience a condemnation worthy of God .   for by the thing through which they suffer distress ,   be torture by the very thing they deem god , they see and recognize the true God whom formerly they have refuse to know ;   with this , their final condemnation    come upon they .
