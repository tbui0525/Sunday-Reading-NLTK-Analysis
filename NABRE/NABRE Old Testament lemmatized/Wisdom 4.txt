b '    well be childlessness with virtue ;   for immortal be the memory of virtue ,   acknowledge both by God and human being .    when it be present people imitate it ,   and they long for it when it be go ; forever it marche crown in triumph ,   victorious in unsullied deed of valor .   but the numerous progeny of the wicked shall be of no avail ;   their spurious offshoot shall not strike deep root   nor take firm hold .    for even though their branch flourish for a time ,   they be unsteady and shall be rock by the wind   and , by the violence of the wind , uproot ;    their twig shall be break off untimely ,   their fruit useless , unripe for eat ,   fit for nothing .   for child bear of lawless union   give evidence of the wickedness of their parent , when they be examine .    C. on Early death    but the righteous one , though he die early , shall be at rest .    for the age that be honorable come not with the passing of time ,    nor can it be measure in term of year .   rather , understanding pass for gray hair ,   and an unsullied life be the attainment of old age .    the one who please God be love ,    live among sinner , be transported\xe2\x80\x94   snatch away , lest wickedness pervert his mind   or deceit beguile his soul ;    for the witchery of paltry thing obscure what be right   and the whirl of desire transform the innocent mind .    having become perfect in a short while ,   he reach the fullness of a long career ;    for his soul be pleasing to the   Lord ,   therefore he speed he out of the midst of wickedness .   but the people see and do not understand ,   nor do they take that consideration into account .      yes , the righteous one who have die will condemn   the sinful who live ; and youth , swiftly complete , will condemn   the many year of the unrighteous who have grow old .    for they will see the death of the wise one   and will not understand what the   Lord   intend ,   or why he keep he safe .   they will see , and hold he in contempt ;   but the   Lord   will laugh they to scorn .    and they shall afterward become dishonored corpse    and an unceasing mockery among the dead . for he shall strike they down speechless and prostrate    and rock they to their foundation ; they shall be utterly lay waste   and shall be in grief   and their memory shall perish .    the judgment of the Wicked   Fearful shall they come , at the counting up of their sin ,   and their lawless deed shall convict they to their face .
