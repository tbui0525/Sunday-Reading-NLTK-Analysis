b ' Gods Past favor and Israels Present need   for the leader . a   maskil   of the Korahites .    I   o God , we have hear with our own ear ;   our ancestor have tell we   the deed you do in their day ,   with your own hand in day of old :   you root out nation to plant they ,    crush people and expel they .   not with their own sword do they conquer the land ,    nor do their own arm bring victory ; it be your right hand , your own arm ,   the light of your face for you favor they .    you be my king and my God ,    who bestow victory on Jacob .   through you we batter our foe ;   through your name we trample our adversary .   not in my bow do I trust ,   nor do my sword bring I victory .   you have bring we victory over our enemy ,   shame those who hate we .   in God we have boast all the day long ;   your name we will praise forever . Selah    II    but now you have reject and disgrace we ;   you do not march out with our army .    you make we retreat    before the foe ;   those who hate we plunder we at will .    you hand we over like sheep to be slaughter ,   scatter we among the nation .    you sell your people for nothing ;   you make no profit from their sale .    you make we the reproach of our neighbor ,    the mockery and scorn of those around we .   you make we a byword among the nation ;   the people shake their head at we .   all day long my disgrace be before I ;   shame have cover my face   at the sound of those who taunt and revile ,   at the sight of the enemy and avenger .    III   all this have come upon we ,   though we have not forget you ,   nor be disloyal to your covenant .    our heart have not turn back ,   nor have our step stray from your path .   yet you have leave we crush ,   desolate in a place of jackal ;     you have cover we with a shadow of death .   if we have forget the name of our God ,   stretch out our hand to another god ,   would not God have discover this ,   God who know the secret of the heart ?   for you we be slay all the day long ,   consider only as sheep to be slaughter .     IV   Awake ! why do you sleep , o Lord ?   rise up ! do not reject we forever !    why do you hide your face ;    why forget our pain and misery ?   for our soul have be humiliate in the dust ;    our belly be press to the earth .   rise up , help we !   redeem we in your mercy .
