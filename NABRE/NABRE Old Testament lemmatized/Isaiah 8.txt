b '   a Son of Isaiah .     the   Lord   say to I : take a large tablet , and inscribe on it with an ordinary stylus ,    belong to Maher - shalal - hash - baz ,        and call reliable witness    for I , Uriah the priest , and Zechariah , son of Jeberechiah .     then I go to the prophetess and she conceive and bear a son . the   Lord   say to I : name he Maher - shalal - hash - baz ,      for before the child learn to say , my father , my mother , the wealth of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria shall be carry off by the king of Assyria .    the Choice : the Lord or Assyria .     again the   Lord   speak to I :     because this people    have reject   the water of Shiloah that flow gently , and melt with fear at the display of Rezin and Remaliahs son ,   therefore the Lord be bring up against they   the water of the River , great and mighty ,   the king of Assyria and all his glory . it shall rise above all its channel ,   and overflow all its bank .   it shall roll on into Judah ,   it shall rage and pass on\xe2\x80\x94   up to the neck it shall reach .   but his outspread wing will fill   the width of your land , Emmanuel !   Band together , o people , but be shatter !   give ear , all you distant land !   arm yourself , but be shatter ! arm yourself , but be shatter !   form a plan , it shall be thwart ;   make a resolve , it shall not be carry out ,   for with we be God !      disciple of Isaiah .     for thus say the   Lord \xe2\x80\x94his hand strong upon me\xe2\x80\x94warne I not to walk in the way of this people :      do not call conspiracy what this people call conspiracy ,   nor fear what they fear , nor feel dread .   but conspire with the   Lord   of host ;   he shall be your fear , he shall be your dread .    he shall be a snare ,   a stone for injury , a rock for stumble   to both the house of Israel , a trap and a snare   to those who dwell in Jerusalem ;    and many among they shall stumble ;   fall and broken ;   snare and capture .      bind up my testimony , seal the instruction with my disciple .        I will trust in the   Lord , who be hide his face from the house of Jacob ; yes , I will wait for he .      here be I and the child whom the   Lord   have give I : we be sign    and portent in Israel from the   Lord   of host , who dwell on Mount Zion .      and when they say to you , inquire of ghost and soothsayer who chirp and mutter ;     should not a people inquire of their god , consult the dead on behalf of the living ,      for instruction and testimony ? surely , those who speak like this be the one for whom there be no dawn .      he will pass through it hard - press and hungry ,   and when hungry , shall become enraged ,   and curse king and god . he will look upward ,    and will gaze at the earth , but will see only distress and darkness ,   oppressive gloom ,   murky , without light .   the Promise of Salvation under a new davidic King .        there be no gloom where there have be distress . where once he degrade the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali , now he have glorify the way of the Sea , the land across the Jordan , Galilee of the Nations .
