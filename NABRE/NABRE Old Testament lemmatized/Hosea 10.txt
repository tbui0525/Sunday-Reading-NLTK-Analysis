b '   destruction of Idolatrous cultic object    Israel be a luxuriant vine   whose fruit match its growth . the more abundant his fruit ,   the more altar he build ; the more productive his land ,   the more sacred pillar    he set up .   their heart be false !   now they will pay for their guilt : God will break down their altar   and destroy their sacred pillar .   for now they will say ,   we have no king !   since we do not fear the   Lord ,   the king\xe2\x80\x94what could he do for we ?   they make promise ,   swear false oath , and make covenant , while lawsuit sprout   like poisonous weed    in the furrow of a field !     the inhabitant of Samaria be afraid   for the calf of Beth - aven ;   its people mourn for it   and its idolatrous priest wail over it ,   \xe2\x80\x94over its glory which have depart from it .    it too will be carry to Assyria ,   as an offering to the great king .    Ephraim will be put to shame ,   Israel will be shame by his scheme .     Samaria and her king will disappear ,   like a twig upon the water .   the high place of Aven    will be destroy ,   the sin of Israel ;   thorn and thistle will overgrow their altar . then they will cry out to the mountain , cover we !   and to the hill , Fall upon we !     War because of Israels Wickedness   since the day of Gibeah    you have sin , Israel . there they take their stand ;   will war not reach they in Gibeah ? against a perverse people    I come and I chastise they ; Peoples will be gather against they   when I bind they to their two crime .    Ephraim be a train heifer ,   that love to thresh ; I myself lay a yoke   upon her beautiful neck ; I will make Ephraim break ground , Judah must plow ,   Jacob must harrow for himself :   Sow for yourself justice ,   reap the reward of loyalty ; break up for yourself a new field ,    for it be time to seek the   Lord ,   till he come and rain justice upon you .    but you have plow wickedness ,   reap perversity ,   and eat the fruit of falsehood . because you have trust in your own power ,   and in your many warrior ,    the clamor of war shall break out among your people   and all your fortress shall be ravage as Salman ravage Beth - arbel    on the day of war ,   smash mother along with their child .    so it will be do to you , Bethel ,   because of your utter wickedness : at dawn    the king of Israel   will utterly disappear .
