b '     then Moses go up from the plain of Moab to Mount Nebo ,    the peak of Pisgah which face Jericho , and the   Lord   show he all the land\xe2\x80\x94Gilead , and as far as Dan ,      all Naphtali , the land of Ephraim and Manasseh , all the land of Judah as far as the Western Sea ,        the Negeb , the plain ( the valley of Jericho , the City of Palms ) , and as far as Zoar .      the   Lord   then say to he , this be the land    about which I promise on oath to Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob , I will give it to your descendant . I have let you see it with your own eye , but you shall not cross over .      so there , in the land of Moab , Moses , the servant of the   Lord , die    as the   Lord   have say ;      and he be bury in a valley in the land of Moab , opposite Beth - peor ; to this day no one know the place of his burial .        Moses be one hundred and twenty year old    when he die , yet his eye be undimmed and his vigor unabated .      the Israelites weep for Moses in the plain of Moab for thirty day , till they have complete the period of grief and mourning for Moses .     now Joshua , son of Nun ,    be fill with the spirit of wisdom , since Moses have lay his hand upon he ; and so the Israelites give he their obedience , just as the   Lord   have command Moses .      since then no prophet have arise in Israel like Moses , whom the   Lord   know face to face ,       in all the sign and wonder the   Lord   send he to perform in the land of Egypt against Pharaoh and all his servant and against all his land ,      and all the great might and the awesome power that Moses display in the sight of all Israel .
