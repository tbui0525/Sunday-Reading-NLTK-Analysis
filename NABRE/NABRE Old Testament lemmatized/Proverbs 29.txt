b '    those stiff - necked in the face of reproof   in an instant will be shatter beyond cure .    when the just flourish , the people rejoice ;   but when the wicked rule , the people groan .     whoever love wisdom give joy to his father ,   but whoever consort with harlot squander his wealth .   by justice a king build up the land ;   but one who raise taxis tear it down .    those who speak flattery to their neighbor   cast a net at their foot .    the sin of the wicked be a trap ,   but the just run along joyfully .    the just care for the cause of the poor ;   the wicked do not understand such care .    Scoffers enflame the city ,   but the wise calm the fury .    if a wise person dispute with a fool ,   there be rail and ridicule but no resolution .   the bloodthirsty hate the blameless ,   but the upright seek his life .    fool give vent to all their anger ;   but the wise , bide their time , control it .    if ruler listen to lie word ,   their servant all become wicked .   the poor and the oppressor meet :    the   Lord   give light to the eye of both .   if a king be honestly for the right of the poor ,   his throne stand firm forever .    the rod of correction give wisdom ,   but uncontrolled youth disgrace their mother .    when the wicked increase , crime increase ;   but the just will behold their downfall .    discipline your child , and they will bring you comfort ,   and give delight to your soul .   without a vision the people lose restraint ;   but happy be the one who follow instruction .    not by word alone can servant be train ;    for they understand but do not respond .    do you see someone hasty in speech ?    there be more hope for a fool !   if servant be pamper from childhood   they will turn out to be stubborn .   the ill - temper stir up strife ,   and the hotheaded cause many sin .    Haughtiness bring humiliation ,   but the humble of spirit acquire honor .     partner of a thief hate themselves ;    they hear the imprecation but do not testify .   fear of other become a snare ,   but the one who trust in the   Lord   be safe .   many curry favor with a ruler ,   but it be from the   Lord   that one receive justice .   an abomination to the just , the evildoer ;   an abomination to the wicked , one whose way be straight .
