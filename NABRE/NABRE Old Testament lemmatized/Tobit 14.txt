b '    part advice .     so the word of Tobits hymn of praise come to an end . Tobit die in peace at the age of a hundred and twelve and be bury with honor in Nineveh .      he be fifty - eight year old when he lose his eyesight , and after he recover it he live in prosperity , give alm ; he continue to fear God and give thank to the divine Majesty .     as he be die , he summon his son Tobiah and Tobiahs seven son , and command he , Son , take your child        and flee into Media , for I believe Gods word that Nahum    speak against Nineveh . it will all happen and will overtake Assyria and Nineveh ; indeed all that be say by Israels prophet whom God send will come to pass . not one of all their word will remain unfulfilled , but everything will take place in the time appoint for it . so it will be safe in Media than in Assyria or Babylon . for I know and believe that whatever God have say will be accomplish . it will happen , and not a single word of the prophecy will fail . as for our kindred who dwell in the land of Israel , they will all be scatter and take into captivity from the good land . all the land of Israel will become a wilderness ; even Samaria and Jerusalem will be a wilderness ! for a time , the house of God will be desolate and will be burn .        but God will again have mercy on they and bring they back to the land of Israel . they will build the house again , but it will not be like the first until the era when the appoint time will be complete .    afterward all of they will return from their captivity , and they will rebuild Jerusalem with due honor . in it the house of God will also be rebuild , just as the prophet of Israel say of it .         all the nation of the world will turn and reverence God in truth ; all will cast away their idol , which have deceitfully lead they into error .        they will bless the God of the age in righteousness . all the Israelites truly mindful of God , who be to be save in those day , will be gather together and will come to Jerusalem ; in security will they dwell forever in the land of Abraham , which will be give to they . those who love God sincerely will rejoice , but those who commit sin and wickedness will disappear completely from the land .      ,      now , my child , I give you this command : serve God sincerely and do what be pleasing in his sight ; you must instruct your child to do what be right and to give alm , to be mindful of God and at all time to bless his name sincerely and with all their strength . now , as for you , son , leave Nineveh ; do not stay here .      the day you bury your mother next to I , do not even stay overnight within the confine of the city . for I see that there be much wickedness in it , and much treachery be practice in it , and people be not ashamed . see , my son , all that Nadin    do to Ahiqar , the very one who rear he . be not Ahiqar bring down alive into the earth ? yet God make Nadins disgraceful crime rebound against he . Ahiqar come out again into the light , but Nadin go into the everlasting darkness , for he have try to kill Ahiqar . because Ahiqar have give alm he escape from the deadly trap Nadin have set for he . but Nadin fall into the deadly trap himself , and it destroy he .        so , my child , see what almsgiving do , and also what wickedness does\xe2\x80\x94it kill ! but now my spirit be about to leave I . death of Tobit and Tobiah .   they lay he on his bed , and he die ; and he be bury with honor .      when Tobiahs mother die , he bury she next to his father . he then depart with his wife and child for Media , where he settle in Ecbatana with his father - in - law Raguel .        he take respectful care of his age father - in - law and mother - in - law ; and he bury they at Ecbatana in Media . then he inherit Raguels estate as well as that of his father Tobit .      he die highly respected at the age of one hundred seventeen .      but before he die , he see and hear of the destruction of Nineveh . he see the inhabitant of the city be lead captive into Media by Cyaxares ,    the king of Media . Tobiah bless God for all that he have do against the Ninevites and Assyrians . before die he rejoice over Nineveh , and he bless the Lord God forever and ever .             '
