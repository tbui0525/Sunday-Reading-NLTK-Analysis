I   why do you glory in what be evil , you who be mighty by the mercy of God ? all day long   you be think up intrigue ;   your tongue be like a sharpen razor ,   you worker of deceit .    you love evil more than good ,   lie rather than say what be right .   Selah   you love all the word that create confusion ,   you deceitful tongue .     II   God too will strike you down forever ,   he will lay hold of you and pluck you from your tent ,   uproot you from the land of the living .   Selah   the righteous will see and they will fear ;   but they will laugh at he :    behold the man ! he do not take God as his refuge ,   but he trust in the abundance of his wealth ,   and grow powerful through his wickedness .     III   but I , like an olive tree    flourish in the house of God ,    I trust in Gods mercy forever and ever .   I will thank you forever   for what you have do . I will put my hope in your name\xe2\x80\x94for it be good ,    \xe2\x80\x94 in the presence of those devote to you .             '
