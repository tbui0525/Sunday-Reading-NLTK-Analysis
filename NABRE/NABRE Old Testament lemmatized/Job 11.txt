b '   Zophars First Speech .     and Zophar the Naamathite answer and say :     should not many word be answer ,   or must the garrulous man necessarily be right ?   shall your babbling keep other silent ,   and shall you deride and no one give rebuke ?   shall you say : my teaching be pure ,   and I be clean in your sight ?   but oh , that God would speak ,    and open his lip against you ,   and tell you the secret of wisdom ,   for good sense have two side ; so you might learn that God   overlook some of your sinfulness .   can you find out the depth of God ?    or find out the perfection of the Almighty ?   it be high than the heavens ; what can you do ?   it be deep than Sheol ; what can you know ?   it be long than the earth in measure ,   and broad than the sea .   if he should seize and imprison   or call to judgment , who then could turn he back ?   for he know the worthless   and see iniquity ; will he then ignore it ?   an empty head will gain understanding ,   when a colt of a wild jackass    be bear human .    if you set your heart aright   and stretch out your hand toward he ,   if iniquity be in your hand , remove it ,   and do not let injustice dwell in your tent ,   surely then you may lift up your face in innocence ;   you may stand firm and unafraid .   for then you shall forget your misery ,   like water that have ebb away you shall regard it .   then your life shall be bright than the noonday ;   its gloom shall become like the morning ,   and you shall be secure , because there be hope ;   you shall look round you and lie down in safety ;     you shall lie down and no one will disturb you . many shall entreat your favor ,    but the wicked , look on , shall be consume with envy . escape shall be cut off from they ,   their only hope their last breath .
