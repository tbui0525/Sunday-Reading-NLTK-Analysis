b '   guilt of the religious and political leader   hear this , priest ,   pay attention , house of Israel , Household of the king , give ear !    for you be responsible for judgment .   but you have be a snare at Mizpah ,    a net spread upon Tabor ,   a pit dig deep in Shittim .   now I will discipline they all .     I know Ephraim ,   and Israel be not hide from I : now , Ephraim , you have practice prostitution ,   Israel be defile .   their deed do not allow they   to return to their God ;   for the spirit of prostitution be in they ,   and they do not know the   Lord .     the arrogance of Israel bear witness against he ;   Israel and Ephraim stumble because of their iniquity ,   and Judah stumble with they .   with their flock and herd they will go   to seek the   Lord , but will not find he ;    he have withdraw from they .   they have betray the   Lord ,   for they have bear illegitimate child ; now the new moon    will devour they   together with their field .    Political Upheavals    blow the ram horn in Gibeah ,   the trumpet in Ramah ! sound the alarm in Beth - aven :    look behind you , Benjamin !    Ephraim shall become a wasteland   on the day of punishment : among the tribe of Israel   I announce what be sure to be .   the prince of Judah have become   like those who move a boundary line ;    upon they I will pour out   my wrath like water .   Ephraim be oppress , crush by judgment ,   for he have willingly go after filth !    I be like a moth for Ephraim ,    like rot for the house of Judah .   when Ephraim see his infirmity ,   and Judah his sore , Ephraim go to Assyria ,   and send to the great king .    but he can not heal you ,   nor take away your sore .   for I be like a lion to Ephraim ,   like a young lion to the house of Judah ;   it be I who tear the prey and depart ,   I carry it away and no one can save it .     Insincere Conversion   I will go back to my place   until they make reparation   and seek my presence . in their affliction , they shall look for I .              '
