b ' Thanksgiving for god blessing   for the leader . a psalm of David . a song .    I   to you we owe our hymn of praise ,   o God on Zion ; to you our vow    must be fulfil ,     you who hear our prayer . to you all flesh must come     with its burden of wicked deed . we be overcome by our sin ;   only you can pardon they .    bless the one whom you will choose and bring   to dwell in your court . may we be fill with the good thing of your house ,   your holy temple !    II   you answer we with awesome deed    of justice ,   o God our savior , the hope of all the end of the earth   and of those far off across the sea .    you be robe in power ,   you set up the mountain by your might .   you still the roaring of the sea ,    the roaring of their wave ,   the tumult of the people .    distant people stand in awe of your marvel ;   the place of morning and evening you make resound with joy .    you visit the earth and water it ,   make it abundantly fertile .   Gods stream    be fill with water ;   you supply their grain . thus do you prepare it :    you drench its plow furrow ,   and level its ridge . with shower you keep it soft ,   bless its young sprout .   you adorn the year with your bounty ;   your path    drip with fruitful rain .   the meadow of the wilderness also drip ;   the hill be robe with joy .   the pasture be clothe with flock ,   the valley blanket with grain ;   they cheer and sing for joy .
