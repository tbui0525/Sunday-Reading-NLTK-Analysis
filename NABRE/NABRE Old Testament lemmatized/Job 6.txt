b '   Jobs First Reply .     then Job answer and say :     ah , could my anguish but be measure   and my calamity lay with it in the scale ,   they would now outweigh the sand of the sea !   because of this I speak without restraint .   for the arrow of the Almighty be in I ,    and my spirit drink in their poison ;   the terror of God be array against I .   do the wild donkey bray when it have grass ?    do the ox low over its fodder ?   can anything insipid be eat without salt ?   be there flavor in the white of an egg ?   I refuse to touch they ;   they be like loathsome food to I .   oh , that I might have my request ,   and that God would grant what I long for :   even that God would decide to crush I ,   that he would put forth his hand and cut I off !   then I should still have consolation   and could exult through unremitting pain ,   because I have not transgress the command of the Holy One .   what strength have I that I should endure ,   and what be my limit that I should be patient ?   have I the strength of stone ,   or be my flesh of bronze ?   have I no helper ,    and have my good sense desert I ?   a friend owe kindness to one in despair ,   though he have forsake the fear of the Almighty .   my companion be undependable as a wadi ,   as watercourse that run dry in the wadie ;   though they may be black with ice ,   and with snow heap upon they ,   yet once they flow , they cease to be ;   in the heat , they disappear from their place .   Caravans wander from their route ;   they go into the wasteland and perish .   the caravan of Tema    search ,   the company of Sheba have hope ;   they be disappointed , though they be confident ;   they come there and be frustrate .   it be thus that you have now become for I ;    you see a terrifying thing and be afraid .   have I say , give I something ,   make a bribe on my behalf from your possession ?   or deliver I from the hand of the enemy ,   redeem I from oppressor ?   teach I , and I will be silent ;   make I understand how I have err .   how painful honest word can be ;   yet how unconvincing be your argument !   do you consider your word as proof ,   but the saying of a desperate man as wind ?   you would even cast lot for the orphan ,   and would barter over your friend !   come , now , give I your attention ;   surely I will not lie to your face .   think it over ; let there be no injustice .   think it over ; I still be right .   be there insincerity on my tongue ,   or can not my taste discern falsehood ?
