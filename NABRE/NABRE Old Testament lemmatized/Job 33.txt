b '    therefore , o Job , hear my discourse ;   listen to all my word .   behold , now I open my mouth ;   my tongue and voice form word .   I will state directly what be in my mind ,   my lip shall speak knowledge clearly ;   for the spirit of God make I ,   the breath of the Almighty keep I alive .    if you be able , refute I ;   draw up your argument and take your stand .   look , I be like you before God ,   I too be pinch from clay .     therefore fear of I should not dismay you ,   nor should I weigh heavily upon you .   but you have say in my hearing ,   as I listen to the sound of your word :   I be clean , without transgression ;   I be innocent , there be no guilt in I .    yet he invent pretext against I   and count I as an enemy .     he put my foot in the stock ,   watch all my path !    in this you be not just , let I tell you ;   for God be great than mortal .   why , then , do you make complaint against he   that he give no reply to their word ?    for God do speak , once ,   even twice , though you do not see it :    in a dream , in a vision of the night ,   when deep sleep fall upon mortal   as they slumber in their bed .   it be then he open their ear   and with a warning , terrify they ,   by turn mortal from act   and keep pride away from a man ,   he hold his soul from the pit ,   his life from pass to the grave .   or he be chasten on a bed of pain ,   suffer continually in his bone ,   so that to his appetite food be repulsive ,   his throat reject the choice nourishment .    his flesh be waste , it can not be see ;   bone , once invisible , appear ;   his soul draw near to the pit ,   his life to the place of the dead .   if then there be a divine messenger ,    a mediator , one out of a thousand ,   to show he what be right ,   he will take pity on he and say ,   deliver he from go down to the pit ;   I have find he a ransom .   then his flesh shall become soft as a boy ;   he shall be again as in the day of his youth .   he shall pray and God will favor he ;   he shall see Gods face with rejoicing ;    for he restore a person righteousness .   he shall sing before all and say ,   I sin and do wrong ,   yet I be not punish accordingly .   he deliver I from pass to the pit ,   and my life see light .   see , all these thing God do ,   two , even three time , for a man ,   bring back his soul from the pit   to the light , in the light of the living .   be attentive , Job , listen to I !   be silent and I will speak .   if you have anything to say , then answer I .   speak out ! I should like to see you justify .   if not , then you listen to I ;   be silent , and I will teach you wisdom .             '
