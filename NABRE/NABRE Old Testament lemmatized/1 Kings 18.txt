b '   Elijah end the Drought .      long afterward , in the third year , the word of the   Lord   come to Elijah : go , present yourself to Ahab , that I may send rain upon the earth .      so Elijah go to present himself to Ahab . now the famine in Samaria be severe ,      and Ahab have summon Obadiah , master of his palace , who greatly revere the   Lord .      when Jezebel be slaughter the prophet of the   Lord , Obadiah take a hundred prophet , hide they away by fifty in cave , and supply they with food and water .      Ahab say to Obadiah , go through the land to all source of water and to all the wadie . we may find grass and keep the horse and mule alive , so that we shall not have to slaughter any of the beast .      divide the land to explore between they , Ahab go one way by himself , Obadiah another way by himself .      as Obadiah be on his way , Elijah meet he . recognize he , Obadiah fall prostrate and ask , be it you , my lord Elijah ?      he say to he , yes . go tell your lord , Elijah be here !        but Obadiah say , what sin have your servant commit , that you be hand I over to Ahab to be kill ?      as the   Lord , your God , live , there be no nation or kingdom where my lord have not send in search of you . when they reply , he be not here , he make each kingdom and nation swear they could not find you .      and now you say , go tell your lord : Elijah be here !      after I leave you , the spirit of the   Lord   will carry you to some place I do not know , and when I go to inform Ahab and he do not find you , he will kill me\xe2\x80\x94though your servant have revere the   Lord   from his youth !      have you not be tell , my lord , what I do when Jezebel be murder the prophet of the   Lord \xe2\x80\x94that I hide a hundred of the prophet of the   Lord , fifty each in cave , and supply they with food and water ?      and now you say , go tell your lord : Elijah be here ! he will kill I !      Elijah answer , as the   Lord   of host live , whom I serve , I will present myself to he today .     so Obadiah go to meet Ahab and inform he , and Ahab come to meet Elijah .      when Ahab see Elijah , he say to he , be it you , you disturber of Israel ?      he answer , it be not I who disturb Israel , but you and your father house , by forsake the command of the   Lord   and you by follow the Baals .      now summon all Israel to I on Mount Carmel , as well as the four hundred and fifty prophet of Baal and the four hundred prophet of Asherah who eat at Jezebels table .      so Ahab summon all the Israelites and have the prophet gather on Mount Carmel .     Elijah approach all the people and say , how long will you straddle the issue ? if the   Lord   be God , follow he ; if Baal , follow he . but the people do not answer he .      so Elijah say to the people , I be the only remain prophet of the   Lord , and there be four hundred and fifty prophet of Baal .      give we two young bull . let they choose one , cut it into piece , and place it on the wood , but start no fire . I shall prepare the other and place it on the wood , but shall start no fire .      you shall call upon the name of your god , and I will call upon the name of the   Lord . the God who answer with fire be God . all the people answer , we agree !     Elijah then say to the prophet of Baal , choose one young bull and prepare it first , for there be more of you . call upon your god , but do not start the fire .      take the young bull that be turn over to they , they prepare it and call upon Baal from morning to noon , say , Baal , answer we ! but there be no sound , and no one answer . and they hop around the altar they have prepare .      when it be noon , Elijah taunt they : call louder , for he be a god ; he may be busy do his business , or may be on a journey . perhaps he be asleep and must be awaken .      they call out louder and slash themselves with sword and spear accord to their ritual until blood gush over they .      Noon pass and they remain in a prophetic state until the time for offer sacrifice . but there be no sound , no one answering , no one listen .     then Elijah say to all the people , come here to I . when they draw near to he , he repair the altar of the   Lord   which have be destroy .      he take twelve stone , for the number of tribe of the son of Jacob , to whom the   Lord   have say : Israel shall be your name .      he build the stone into an altar to the name of the   Lord , and make a trench around the altar large enough for two measure of grain .      when he have arrange the wood , he cut up the young bull and lay it on the wood .      he say , fill four jar with water and pour it over the burn offering and over the wood . do it again , he say , and they do it again . do it a third time , he say , and they do it a third time .      the water flow around the altar ; even the trench be fill with the water .      at the time for offer sacrifice , Elijah the prophet come forward and say ,   Lord , God of Abraham , Isaac , and Israel , let it be know this day that you be God in Israel and that I be your servant and have do all these thing at your command .       answer I ,   Lord ! answer I , that this people may know that you ,   Lord , be God and that you have turn their heart back to you .      the   Lord s fire come down and devour the burn offering , wood , stone , and dust , and lap up the water in the trench .      see this , all the people fall prostrate and say , the   Lord   be God ! the   Lord   be God !       then Elijah say to they , seize the prophet of Baal . let none of they escape ! they seize they , and Elijah bring they down to the Wadi Kishon and there he slaughter they .      Elijah then say to Ahab , go up , eat and drink , for there be the sound of a heavy rain .      so Ahab go up to eat and drink , while Elijah go up to the top of Carmel , crouch down to the earth , and put his head between his knee .      he say to his servant , go up and look out to sea . he go up and look , but report , there be nothing . seven time he say , go look again !      and the seventh time the youth report , there be a cloud as small as a mans hand rise from the sea . Elijah say , go and say to Ahab , Harness up and go down the mountain before the rain stop you .      all at once the sky grow dark with cloud and wind , and a heavy rain fall . Ahab mount his chariot and head for Jezreel .      but the hand of the   Lord   be on Elijah . he gird up his clothing and run before Ahab as far as the approach to Jezreel .             '
