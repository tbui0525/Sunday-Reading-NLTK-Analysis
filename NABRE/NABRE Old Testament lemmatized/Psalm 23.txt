b ' the Lord , Shepherd and Host   a psalm of David . I the   Lord   be my shepherd ;    there be nothing I lack .    in green pasture he make I lie down ;   to still water he lead I ;     he restore my soul . he guide I along right path    for the sake of his name .   even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death ,    I will fear no evil , for you be with I ;   your rod and your staff comfort I .    II    you set a table before I   in front of my enemy ; you anoint my head with oil ;    my cup overflow .    indeed , goodness and mercy    will pursue I   all the day of my life ; I will dwell in the house of the   Lord    for endless day .
