b ' prayer at the destruction of the Temple   A   maskil   of Asaph . I why , God , have you cast we off forever ?     why do your anger burn against the sheep of your pasture ?    remember your people , whom you acquire of old ,   the tribe you redeem as your own heritage ,   Mount Zion where you dwell .    direct your step toward the utter destruction ,   everything the enemy lay waste in the sanctuary .   your foe roar triumphantly in the place of your assembly ;   they set up their own token of victory .   they hack away like a forester gathering bough ,   swinge his ax in a thicket of tree .   they smash all its engrave work ,   strike it with ax and pick .   they set your sanctuary on fire ,   profane your name abode by raze it to the ground .    they say in their heart , we will destroy they all !   burn all the assembly - place of God in the land !    even so we have see no sign for we ,   there be no prophet any more ,    no one among we who know for how long .   how long , o God , will the enemy jeer ?    will the enemy revile your name forever ?   why draw back your hand ,   why hold back your right hand within your bosom ?     II    yet you , God , be my king from of old ,   win victory throughout the earth .   you stir up the sea by your might ;    you smash the head of the dragon on the water .    you crush the head of Leviathan ,    give he as food to the shark .   you open up spring and torrent ,   bring dry land out of the primeval water .    yours the day and yours the night too ;   you set the moon and sun in place .   you fix all the limit of the earth ;   summer and winter you make .    remember how the enemy have jeer ,   Lord ,   how a foolish people have revile your name .   do not surrender to wild animal those who praise you ;   do not forget forever the life of your afflict .   look to your covenant ,   for the recess of the land   be full of the haunt of violence .   let not the oppressed turn back in shame ;   may the poor and needy praise your name .   Arise , God , defend your cause ;   remember the constant jeering of the fool .   do not forget the clamor of your foe ,   the unceasing uproar of your enemy .             '
