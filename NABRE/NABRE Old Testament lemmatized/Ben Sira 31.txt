b '   the Proper Attitude toward Riches    Wakefulness over wealth waste away the flesh ,   and anxiety over it drive away sleep .   wakeful anxiety banish slumber ;   more than a serious illness it disturb repose .   the rich labor to pile up wealth ,   and if they rest , it be to enjoy pleasure ;   the poor labor for a meager living ,   and if they ever rest , they become needy .   the lover of gold will not be free from sin ;   whoever pursue money will be lead astray by it .   many have come to ruin for the sake of gold ,   yet destruction lay before their very eye ;    it be a stumble block for fool ;   any simpleton will be ensnare by it .     happy the rich person find without fault ,   who do not turn aside after wealth .    who be he , that we may praise he ?   for he have do wonder among his people .   who have be test by gold and be find perfect ?   let it be for he his glory ; who could have sin but do not ,   and could have do evil but do not ?   so his good fortune be secure ,   and the assembly will recount his praise .     Table Etiquette    be you seat at the table of the great ?   bring to it no greedy gullet , nor say , how much food there be here !    remember that the greedy eye be evil . what have be create more greedy than the eye ?   therefore , it weep for any cause .    recognize that your neighbor feel as you do ,   and keep in mind everything you dislike .   toward what he look at , do not put out a hand ;   nor reach for the same dish when he do .   eat , like anyone else , what be set before you ,   but do not eat greedily , lest you be despise .   be the first to stop , as befit good manner ;   and do not gorge yourself , lest you give offense .    if there be many with you at table ,   do not be the first to stretch out your hand .   do not a little suffice for a well - breed person ?   when he lie down , he do not wheeze .    moderate eating ensure sound slumber   and a clear mind on rise the next day . the distress of sleeplessness and of nausea   and colic be with the glutton !   should you have eat too much ,   get up to vomit    and you will have relief .     listen to I , my child , and do not scorn I ;   later you will find my advice good . in whatever you do , be moderate ,   and no sickness will befall you .   People bless one who be generous with food ,   and this testimony to his goodness be last .    the city complain about one who be stingy with food ,   and this testimony to his stinginess be last .   let not wine be the proof of your strength ,   for wine have be the ruin of many .   as the furnace test the work of the smith ,   so do wine the heart of the insolent .
