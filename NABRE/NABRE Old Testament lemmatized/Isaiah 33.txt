b '   overthrow of Assyria    ah ! you destroyer never destroy ,   betrayer never betray ! when you have finish destroy , you will be destroy ;   when you have stop betray , you will be betray .    Lord , be gracious to we ; for you we wait .   be our strength every morning ,   our salvation in time of trouble !    at the roaring sound , people flee ;   when you rise in your majesty , nation be scatter .    Spoil be gather up as caterpillar gather ,   an onrush like the rush of locust .    the   Lord   be exalt , enthrone on high ;   he fill Zion with right and justice .    that which make her season certain ,   her wealth , salvation , wisdom , and knowledge ,   be the fear of the   Lord , her treasure .    see , the man of Ariel cry out in the street ,   the messenger of Shalem    weep bitterly .   the highway be desolate ,   traveler have quit the path , covenant be break , witness spurn ;   yet no one give it a thought .    the country languish in mourning ,   Lebanon wither with shame ; Sharon    be like the Arabah ,   Bashan and Carmel be strip bare .    now I will rise up , say the   Lord ,   now exalt myself ,   now lift myself up .    you conceive dry grass , bring forth stubble ;   my spirit shall consume you like fire .   the people shall be burn to lime ,   thorn cut down to burn in fire .    hear , you who be far off , what I have do ;   you who be near , acknowledge my might .   in Zion sinner be in dread ,   tremble grip the impious : who of we can live with consume fire ?   who of we can live with everlasting flame ?    whoever walk righteously and speak honestly ,   who spurn what be gain by oppression , who wave off contact with a bribe ,   who stop his ear so as not to hear of bloodshed ,   who close his eye so as not to look on evil\xe2\x80\x94    that one shall dwell on the height ,   with fortress of rock for stronghold ,   food and drink in steady supply .   your eye will see a king    in his splendor ,   they will look upon a vast land .    your mind will dwell on the terror :   where be the one who count , where the one who weigh ?   where the one who count the tower ?    you shall no long see a defiant people ,   a people of speech too obscure to comprehend ,   stammer in a tongue not understand .    look to Zion , the city of our festival ;   your eye shall see Jerusalem   as a quiet abode , a tent not to be strike , whose peg will never be pull up ,   nor any of its rope sever .    indeed the   Lord   in majesty will be there for we   a place of river and wide stream   on which no galley may go ,   where no majestic ship    may pass .    for the   Lord   be our judge ,   the   Lord   be our lawgiver ,   the   Lord   be our king ;   he it be who will save we .   the rigging hang slack ;   it can not hold the mast in place ,   nor keep the sail spread out . then the blind will divide great spoil   and the lame will carry off the loot .    no one who dwell there will say , I be sick ;   the people who live there will be forgive their guilt .
