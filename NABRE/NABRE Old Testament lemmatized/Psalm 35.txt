b ' prayer for help against Unjust enemy   of David . I   oppose , o   Lord , those who oppose I ;   war upon those who make war upon I .   take up the shield and buckler ;   rise up in my defense .   brandish lance and battle - ax   against my pursuer . say to my soul ,   I be your salvation .   let those who seek my life   be put to shame and disgrace . let those who plot evil against I    be turn back and confound .   make they like chaff before the wind ,    with the angel of the   Lord   drive they on .   make their way slippery and dark ,   with the angel of the   Lord   pursue they .    II   without cause they set their snare for I ;   without cause they dig a pit for I .   let ruin overtake they unawares ;   let the snare they have set catch they ;   let they fall into the pit they have dig .    then I will rejoice in the   Lord ,   exult in Gods salvation .   my very bone shall say ,   O   Lord , who be like you ,   who rescue the afflict from the powerful ,   the afflict and needy from the despoiler ?    III   malicious witness rise up ,   accuse I of thing I do not know .   they repay I evil for good ;   my soul be desolate .     yet I , when they be ill , put on sackcloth ,   afflict myself with fasting ,   sob my prayer upon my bosom .   I go about in grief as for my brother ,   bent in mourning as for my mother .   yet when I stumble they gather with glee ,   gather against I and I do not know it . they slander I without cease ;    without respect they mock I ,   gnash their tooth against I .    IV   O Lord , how long will you look on ?   restore my soul from their destruction ,   my very life from lion !    then I will thank you in the great assembly ;   I will praise you before the mighty throng .    do not let lie foe rejoice over I ,   my undeserved enemy wink knowingly .    they speak no word of peace ,   but against the quiet in the land   they fashion deceitful speech .    they open wide their mouth against I .   they say , Aha ! good !   our eye have see it !    you see this ,   Lord ; do not be silent ;    Lord , do not withdraw from I .   Awake , be vigilant in my defense ,   in my cause , my God and my Lord .   defend I because you be just ,   Lord ;   my God , do not let they rejoice over I .   do not let they say in their heart ,   Aha ! our soul !   do not let they say ,   we have devour that one !   put to shame and confound   all who relish my misfortune . clothe with shame and disgrace   those who lord it over I .   but let those who favor my just cause   shout for joy and be glad . may they ever say , exalted be the   Lord   who delight in the peace of his loyal servant .   then my tongue shall recount your justice ,   declare your praise , all the day long .
