b '   Third Summons    hear this word which I utter concern you ,   this dirge , house of Israel :   she be fall , to rise no more ,   virgin Israel ; she lie abandon on her land ,   with no one to raise she up .    for thus say the Lord   God   to the house of Israel : the city that march out with a thousand   shall be leave with a hundred , another that march out with a hundred   shall be leave with ten .   for thus say the   Lord    to the house of Israel : seek I , that you may live ,     but do not seek Bethel ; do not come to Gilgal ,   and do not cross over to Beer - sheba ; for Gilgal shall be lead into exile   and Bethel shall be no more .    seek the   Lord , that you may live ,   lest he flare up against the house of Joseph    like a fire   that shall consume the house of Israel , with no one to quench it .     the one who make the Pleiades and Orion ,   who turn darkness into dawn ,   and darken day into night ; who summon the water of the sea ,   and pour they out on the surface of the earth ;    who make destruction fall suddenly upon the stronghold   and bring ruin upon the fortress ,   the   Lord   be his name .     First Woe   Woe to those who turn justice into wormwood   and cast righteousness to the ground ,   they hate those who reprove at the gate   and abhor those who speak with integrity ;   therefore , because you tax the destitute   and exact from they levy of grain , though you have build house of hewn stone ,   you shall not live in they ; though you have plant choice vineyard ,   you shall not drink their wine .    yes , I know how many be your crime ,   how grievous your sin : oppress the just , accept bribe ,   turn away the needy at the gate .   ( therefore at this time the wise be strike dumb   for it be an evil time . )     seek good and not evil ,   that you may live ; then truly the   Lord , the God of host ,   will be with you as you claim .   hate evil and love good ,   and let justice prevail at the gate ; then it may be that the   Lord , the God of host ,   will have pity on the remnant of Joseph .      therefore , thus say the   Lord ,   the God of host , the Lord : in every square there shall be lamentation ,   and in every street they shall cry , oh , no ! they shall summon the farmer to wail   and the professional mourner to lament .   and in every vineyard there shall be lamentation   when I pass through your midst , say the   Lord .    Second Woe   Woe to those who yearn   for the day of the   Lord !   what will the day of the   Lord   mean for you ?   it will be darkness , not light !    as if someone flee from a lion   and a bear meet he ; or as if on enter the house   he rest his hand against the wall ,   and a snake bit it .   truly , the day of the   Lord   will be darkness , not light ,   gloom without any brightness !       I hate , I despise your feast ,   I take no pleasure in your solemnity .   even though you bring I your burn offering and grain offering   I will not accept they ; your stall - feed communion offering ,   I will not look upon they .   take away from I   your noisy song ; the melody of your harp ,   I will not listen to they .   rather let justice surge like water ,   and righteousness like an unfailing stream .    do you bring I sacrifice and grain offering   for forty year in the desert , o house of Israel ?    yet you will carry away Sukuth ,    your king ,   and Kaiwan , your star - image ,   your god that you have make for yourself ,    as I exile you beyond Damascus ,   say the   Lord ,   whose name be the God of host .
