b '   Debts and the Poor .     at the end of every seven - year period    you shall have a remission of debt ,        and this be the manner of the remission . creditor shall remit all claim on loan make to a neighbor , not press the neighbor , one who be kin , because the   Lord s remission have be proclaim .      you may press a foreigner , but you shall remit the claim on what your kin owe to you .         however , since the   Lord , your God , will bless you abundantly in the land the   Lord , your God , will give you to possess as a heritage , there shall be no one of you in need      if you but listen to the voice of the   Lord , your God , and carefully observe this entire commandment which I enjoin on you today .      since the   Lord , your God , will bless you as he promise , you will lend to many nation , and borrow from none ;    you will rule over many nation , and none will rule over you .      if one of your kindred be in need in any community in the land which the   Lord , your God , be give you , you shall not harden your heart nor close your hand against your kin who be in need .      instead , you shall freely open your hand and generously lend what suffice to meet that need .        be careful not to entertain the mean thought , the seventh year , the year of remission , be near , so that you would begrudge your kin who be in need and give nothing , and your kin would cry to the   Lord   against you and you would be hold guilty .        when you give , give generously and not with a stingy heart ; for that , the   Lord , your God , will bless you in all your work and undertaking .      the land will never lack for needy person ; that be why I command you : open your hand freely to your poor and to your needy kin in your land .     Hebrew slave .      if your kin , a hebrew man or woman , sell himself or herself to you , he or she be to serve you for six year , but in the seventh year you shall release he or she as a free person .       when you release a male from your service , as a free person , you shall not send he away empty - handed ,      but shall weigh he down with gift from your flock and threshing floor and wine press ; as the   Lord , your God , have bless you , so you shall give to he .      for remember that you too be slave in the land of Egypt , and the   Lord , your God , redeem you . that be why I be give you this command today .         but if he say to you , I do not wish to leave you , because he love you and your household , since he be well off with you ,      you shall take an awl and put it through his ear    into the door , and he shall be your slave forever . your female slave , also , you shall treat in the same way .      do not be reluctant when you let they go free , since the service they have give you for six year be worth twice a hire laborer salary ; and the   Lord , your God , will bless you in everything you do .    Firstlings .      you shall consecrate to the   Lord , your God , every male firstling bear in your herd and in your flock . you shall not work the firstling of your cattle , nor shear the firstling of your flock .      in the presence of the   Lord , your God , you shall eat they year after year , you and your household , in the place that the   Lord   will choose .         but if a firstling have any defect , lameness or blindness , any such serious defect , you shall not sacrifice it to the   Lord , your God ,      but in your own community you may eat it , the unclean and the clean eat it together , as you would a gazelle or a deer .      only , you must not eat of its blood ; you shall pour it out on the ground like water .
