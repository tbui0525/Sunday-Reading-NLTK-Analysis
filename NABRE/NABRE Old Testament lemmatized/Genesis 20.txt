b '   Abraham at Gerar .      from there Abraham journey on to the region of the Negeb , where he settle between Kadesh and Shur .    while he reside in Gerar as an alien ,      Abraham say of his wife Sarah , she be my sister . so Abimelech , king of Gerar , send and take Sarah .      but God come to Abimelech in a dream one night and say to he : you be about to die because of the woman you have take , for she have a husband .      Abimelech , who have not approach she , say : o Lord , would you kill an innocent man ?      be he not the one who tell I , she be my sister ? she herself also state , he be my brother . I act with pure heart and with clean hand .       God answer he in the dream : yes , I know you do it with a pure heart . in fact , it be I who keep you from sin against I ; that be why I do not let you touch she .      so now , return the mans wife so that he may intercede for you , since he be a prophet ,    that you may live . if you do not return she , you can be sure that you and all who be yours will die .     early the next morning Abimelech call all his servant and inform they of everything that have happen , and the man be fill with fear .      then Abimelech summon Abraham and say to he : what have you do to we ! what wrong do I do to you that you would have bring such great guilt on I and my kingdom ? you have treat I in an intolerable way .      what do you have in mind , Abimelech ask he , that you would do such a thing ?      Abraham answer , I think there would be no fear of God    in this place , and so they would kill I on account of my wife .      besides , she really be my sister ,    but only my father daughter , not my mother ; and so she become my wife .      when God send I wander from my father house , I ask she : would you do I this favor ? in whatever place we come to , say : he be my brother .      then Abimelech take flock and herd and male and female slave and give they to Abraham ; and he restore his wife Sarah to he .      then Abimelech say , here , my land be at your disposal ; settle wherever you please .      to Sarah he say : I hereby give your brother a thousand shekel of silver . this will preserve your honor before all who be with you and will exonerate you before everyone .      Abraham then intercede with God , and God restore health to Abimelech , to his wife , and his maidservant , so that they bear child ;      for the   Lord   have close every womb in Abimelechs household on account of Abrahams wife Sarah .
