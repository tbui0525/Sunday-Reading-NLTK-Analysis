b '   Damascus    Oracle on Damascus :   see , Damascus shall cease to be a city   and become a pile of ruin ;    her city shall be forever abandon ,   for flock to lie in undisturbed .   the fortress shall vanish from Ephraim    and dominion from Damascus ; the remnant of Aram shall become like the glory   of the Israelites\xe2\x80\x94   oracle of the   Lord   of host .    on that day the glory of Jacob shall fade ,   and his full body shall grow thin .    like the reaper mere armful of stalk ,   when he gather the stand grain ; or as when one glean the ear   in the Valley of Rephaim .     only gleaning shall be leave in it ,   as when an olive tree have be beaten\xe2\x80\x94 two or three olive at the very top ,   four or five on its most fruitful branches\xe2\x80\x94   oracle of the   Lord , the God of Israel .    on that day people shall turn to their maker ,   their eye shall look to the Holy One of Israel .    they shall not turn to the altar , the work of their hand ,   nor shall they look to what their finger have make :   the asherah    or the incense stand .   on that day his strong city shall be   like those abandon by the Hivites and Amorites when face with the Israelites ;   and there shall be desolation .    truly , you have forget the God who save you ,   the Rock , your refuge , you have not remember .   therefore , though you plant plant for the Pleasant One ,    and set out cutting for a foreign one ,    though you make they grow the day you plant they   and make they blossom the morning you set they out , the harvest shall disappear on a day of sickness   and incurable pain .   ah ! the roaring of many peoples\xe2\x80\x94    a roar like the roar of the sea ! the thundering of nations\xe2\x80\x94   thunder like the thundering of mighty water !     but God shall rebuke they ,   and they shall flee far away , drive like chaff on the mountain before a wind ,   like tumbleweed before a storm .    at evening , there be terror ,   but before morning , they be go ! such be the portion of those who despoil we ,   the lot of those who plunder we .
