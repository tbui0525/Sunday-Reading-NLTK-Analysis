b '   eulogy of the Romans .      Judas have hear of the reputation of the Romans . they be valiant fighter and act amiably to all who take their side . they establish a friendly alliance with all who apply to they .      he be also tell of their battle and the brave deed that they perform against the Gauls ,    conquer they and force they to pay tribute ;      and what they do in Spain to get possession of the silver and gold mine there .      by planning and persistence they subjugate the whole region , although it be very remote from their own . they also subjugate the king who have come against they from the far corner of the earth until they crush they and inflict on they severe defeat . the rest pay tribute to they every year .      Philip    and Perseus , king of the Macedonians , and the other who oppose they in battle they overwhelm and subjugate .      Antiochus    the great , king of Asia , who fight against they with a hundred and twenty elephant and with cavalry and chariot and a very great army , be defeat by they .      they take he alive and oblige he and the king who succeed he to pay a heavy tribute , to give hostage and to cede      Lycia , Mysia , and Lydia    from among their good province . the Romans take these from he and give they to King Eumenes .       when the Greeks plan to come and destroy they ,      the Romans discover it , and send against the Greeks a single general who make war on they . many be wound and fall , and the Romans take their wife and child captive . they plunder they , take possession of their land , tear down their stronghold and reduce they to slavery even to this day .      all the other kingdom and island that have ever oppose they they destroy and enslave ; with their friend , however , and those who rely on they , they maintain friendship .      they subjugate king both near and far , and all who hear of their fame be afraid of they .      those whom they wish to help and to make king , they make king ; and those whom they wish , they depose ; and they be greatly exalted .      yet with all this , none of they put on a diadem or wear purple as a display of grandeur .      but they make for themselves a senate chamber , and every day three hundred and twenty man take counsel , deliberate on all that concern the people and their well - being .      they entrust their government to one man    every year , to rule over their entire land , and they all obey that one , and there be no envy or jealousy among they .    Treaty with the Romans .     so Judas choose Eupolemus , son of John , son of Accos , and Jason , son of Eleazar , and send they to Rome to establish friendship and alliance with they .        he do this to lift the yoke from Israel , for it be obvious that the kingdom of the Greeks be subject they to slavery .      after make a very long journey to Rome , the envoy enter the senate chamber and speak as follow :      Judas , call Maccabeus , and his brother , with the jewish people , have send we to you to establish alliance and peace with you , and to be enrol among your ally and friend .      the proposal please the Romans ,      and this be a copy of the reply they inscribe on bronze tablet and send to Jerusalem ,    to remain there with the Jews as a record of peace and alliance :      may it be well with the Romans and the jewish nation at sea and on land forever ; may sword and enemy be far from they .      but if war be first make on Rome , or any of its ally in any of their dominion ,      the jewish nation will fight along with they wholeheartedly , as the occasion shall demand ;      and to those who wage war they shall not give or provide grain , weapon , money , or ship , as seem good to Rome . they shall fulfill their obligation without receive any recompense .      in the same way , if war be make first on the jewish nation , the Romans will fight along with they willingly , as the occasion shall demand ,      and to those who attack they there shall not be give grain , weapon , money , or ship , as seem good to Rome . they shall fulfill their obligation without deception .      on these term the Romans have make an agreement with the jewish people .      but if both party hereafter agree to add or take away anything , they shall do as they choose , and whatever they shall add or take away shall be valid .     moreover , concern the wrong that King Demetrius be do to they , we have write to he thus : why have you make your yoke heavy upon our friend and ally the Jews ?      if they petition against you again , we will enforce justice and make war on you by sea and land .
