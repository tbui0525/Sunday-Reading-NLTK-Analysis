b ' Processional Hymn   a psalm of thanksgiving . shout joyfully to the   Lord , all you land ;    serve the   Lord   with gladness ;   come before he with joyful song .    know that the   Lord   be God ,   he make we , we belong to he ,   we be his people , the flock he shepherd .    enter his gate with thanksgiving ,   his court with praise . give thank to he , bless his name ;     good indeed be the   Lord , his mercy endure forever ,   his faithfulness last through every generation .
