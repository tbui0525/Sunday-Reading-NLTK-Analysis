b '   Tyre and Sidon     Oracle on Tyre : Wail , ship of Tarshish ,   for your port be destroy ; from the land of the Kittim    the news reach they .    Silence ! you who dwell on the coast ,   you merchant of Sidon , whose messenger cross the sea    over the deep water , whose revenue be the grain of Shihor ,    the harvest of the Nile ,   you who be the merchant among the nation .    be ashamed , Sidon , fortress on the sea ,   for the sea    have speak , I have not be in labor , nor give birth ,   nor raise young man ,   nor rear young woman .   when the report reach Egypt   they shall be in anguish at the report about Tyre .   Pass over to Tarshish ,    wail , you who dwell on the coast !   be this your exultant city ,   whose origin be from old , whose foot have take she   to dwell in distant land ?   who have plan such a thing   against Tyre , the bestower of crown , whose merchant be prince ,   whose trader be the earth honor man ?   the   Lord   of host have plan it ,   to disgrace the height of all beauty ,   to degrade all the honor of the earth .    Cross to your own land ,   ship of Tarshish ;   the harbor be no more .   his hand he stretch out over the sea ,   he shake kingdom ; the   Lord   command the destruction   of Canaans stronghold :     crush , you shall exult no more ,   virgin daughter Sidon . Arise , pass over to the Kittim ,   even there you shall find no rest .     look at the land of the Chaldeans ,   the people that have cease to be . Assyria found it for ship ,   raise its tower , only to tear down its palace ,   and turn it into a ruin .    Lament , ship of Tarshish ,   for your stronghold be destroy .     on that day , Tyre shall be forget for seventy year ,    the lifetime of one king . at the end of seventy year , the song about the prostitute will be Tyres song :     take a harp , go about the city ,   forget prostitute ; pluck the string skillfully , sing many song ,   that you may be remember .     at the end of the seventy year the   Lord   shall visit Tyre . she shall return to her hire and serve as prostitute    with all the world kingdom on the face of the earth .        but her merchandise and her hire shall be sacred to the   Lord . it shall not be store up or lay away ; instead , her merchandise shall belong to those who dwell before the   Lord , to eat their fill and clothe themselves in choice attire .
