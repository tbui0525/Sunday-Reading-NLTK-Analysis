I will establish my covenant with you , that never again shall all creature be destroy by the water of a flood ; there shall not be another flood to devastate the earth .        God say : this be the sign of the covenant that I be make between I and you and every live creature with you for all age to come :       I set my bow in the cloud to serve as a sign of the covenant between I and the earth .      when I bring cloud over the earth , and the bow appear in the cloud ,      I will remember my covenant between I and you and every live creature\xe2\x80\x94every mortal being\xe2\x80\x94so that the water will never again become a flood to destroy every mortal being .        when the bow appear in the cloud , I will see it and remember the everlasting covenant between God and every live creature\xe2\x80\x94every mortal being that be on earth .

Ham , the father of Canaan , see his father nakedness , and he tell his two brother outside .      Shem and Japheth , however , take a robe , and hold it on their shoulder , they walk backward and cover their father nakedness ; since their face be turn the other way , they do not see their father nakedness .      when Noah wake up from his wine and learn what his young son have do to he ,      he say : Cursed be Caanan !   the low of slave   shall he be to his brother .      he also say : bless be the   Lord , the God of Shem !   let Canaan be his slave .   may God expand Japheth ,    and may he dwell among the tent of Shem ;   and let Canaan be his slave .
