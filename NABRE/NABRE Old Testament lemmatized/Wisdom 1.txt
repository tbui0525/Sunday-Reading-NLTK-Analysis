b '   Exhortation to Righteousness , the Key to life   Love righteousness ,    you who judge the earth ;    think of the   Lord   in goodness ,   and seek he in integrity of heart ;    because he be find by those who do not test he ,   and manifest himself to those who do not disbelieve he .    for perverse counsel separate people from God ,   and his power , put to the proof , rebuke the foolhardy ;     because into a soul that plot evil wisdom do not enter ,   nor do she dwell in a body under debt of sin .    for the holy spirit of discipline    flee deceit   and withdraw from senseless counsel   and be rebuke when unrighteousness occur .      for wisdom be a kindly spirit ,   yet she do not acquit blasphemous lip ; because God be the witness of the inmost self    and the sure observer of the heart   and the listener to the tongue .    for the spirit of the   Lord   fill the world ,    be all - embrace , and know whatever be say .   therefore those who utter wicked thing will not go unnoticed ,   nor will chastise condemnation pass they by .    for the device of the wicked shall be scrutinize ,   and the sound of their word shall reach the   Lord ,   for the chastisement of their transgression ;   because a jealous ear hearken to everything ,    and discordant grumbling be not secret .   therefore guard against profitless grumbling ,   and from calumny    withhold your tongue ; for a stealthy utterance will not go unpunished ,   and a lie mouth destroy the soul .     do not court death    by your err way of life ,   nor draw to yourselves destruction by the work of your hand .   because God do not make death ,    nor do he rejoice in the destruction of the living .   for he fashion all thing that they might have be ,   and the creature of the world be wholesome ; there be not a destructive drug among they   nor any domain of Hades    on earth ,   for righteousness be undying .      the Wicked Reject Immortality and Righteousness Alike   it be the wicked who with hand and word invite death ,   consider it a friend , and pine for it ,   and make a covenant with it , because they deserve to be ally with it .
