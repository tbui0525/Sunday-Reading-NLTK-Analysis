b '   the Potters Vessel .      this word come to Jeremiah from the   Lord :      Arise and go down to the potter house ; there you will hear my word .      I go down to the potter house and there he be , work at the wheel .      whenever the vessel of clay he be make turn out badly in his hand , he try again , make another vessel of whatever sort he please .        then the word of the   Lord   come to I :      can I not do to you , house of Israel , as this potter have done?\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord . indeed , like clay in the hand of the potter , so be you in my hand , house of Israel .         at one moment I may decree concern a nation or kingdom that I will uproot and tear down and destroy it ;      but if that nation against whom I have decree turn from its evil , then I will have a change of heart regard the evil which I have decree .        at another moment , I may decree concern a nation or kingdom that I will build up and plant it ;      but if that nation do what be evil in my eye , refuse to obey my voice , then I will have a change of heart regard the good with which I plan to bless it .      and now , tell this to the people of Judah and the inhabitant of Jerusalem : thus say the   Lord : look , I be fashion evil against you and make a plan . return , all of you , from your evil way ; reform your way and your deed .        but they will say , no use ! we will follow our own device ; each one of we will behave accord to the stubbornness of our evil heart !     Unnatural Apostasy    therefore thus say the   Lord : ask among the nations\xe2\x80\x94   who have ever hear the like ? truly horrible thing   virgin Israel have do !    do the snow of Lebanon    desert the rocky height ? do the gush water dry up   that flow fresh down the mountain ?   yet my people have forget I :   they offer incense in vain . they stumble off their path ,   the way of old , travel on bypath ,   not the beat track .    their land shall be make a waste ,   an object of endless hissing :   all passersby will be horrified ,   shake their head .    like the east wind , I will scatter they   before their enemy ; I will show they my back , not my face ,   in their day of disaster .     another Prayer for Vengeance .     come , they say , let we devise a plot against Jeremiah , for instruction will not perish from the priest , nor counsel from the wise , nor the word from the prophet . come , let we destroy he by his own tongue . let we pay careful attention to his every word .      pay attention to I , o   Lord ,   and listen to what my adversary say .   must good be repay with evil   that they should dig a pit to take my life ? remember that I stand before you   to speak on their behalf ,   to turn your wrath away from they .    so now , give their child    to famine ,    deliver they to the power of the sword . let their wife be childless and widow ;   let their husband die of pestilence ,   their youth be strike down by the sword in battle .   May cry be hear from their home ,   when suddenly you send plunderer against they . for they have dig a pit to capture I ,   they have hide snare for my foot ;   but you ,   Lord , know   all their planning for my death . do not forgive their crime ,   and their sin do not blot out from your sight ! let they stumble before you ,   in the time of your anger act against they .
