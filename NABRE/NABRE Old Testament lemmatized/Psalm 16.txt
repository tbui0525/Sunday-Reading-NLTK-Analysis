b ' God the Supreme Good    a   miktam    of David . I keep I safe , o God ;   in you I take refuge .   I say to the   Lord ,   you be my Lord ,   you be my only good .   as for the holy one who be in the land ,   they be noble ,   in whom be all my delight .    they multiply their sorrow   who court other god . blood libation to they I will not pour out ,   nor will I take their name upon my lip .   Lord , my allot portion and my cup ,   you have make my destiny secure .     pleasant place be measure out for I ;   fair to I indeed be my inheritance .    II   I bless the   Lord   who counsel I ;   even at night my heart exhort I .   I keep the   Lord   always before I ;   with he at my right hand , I shall never be shake .    therefore my heart be glad , my soul rejoice ;   my body also dwell secure ,   for you will not abandon my soul to Sheol ,   nor let your devout one see the pit .     you will show I the path to life ,   abound joy in your presence ,   the delight at your right hand forever .
