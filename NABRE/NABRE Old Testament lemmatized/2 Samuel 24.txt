b '   Davids Census ; the plague .     the   Lord s anger against Israel flare again ,    and he incite David against they : go , take a census of Israel and Judah .      the king therefore say to Joab and the leader of the army who be with he , tour all the tribe of Israel from Dan to Beer - sheba and register the people , that I may know their number .      but Joab reply to the king : may the   Lord   your God increase the number of people a hundredfold for my lord the king to see it with his own eye . but why do it please my lord to do a thing of this kind ?      however , the king command prevail over Joab and the leader of the army , so they leave the king presence in order to register the people of Israel .      cross the Jordan , they begin near Aroer , south of the city in the wadi , and turn in the direction of Gad toward Jazer .      they continue on to Gilead and to the district below Mount Hermon . then they proceed to Dan ; from there they turn toward Sidon ,      go to the fortress of Tyre and to all the city of the Hivites and Canaanites , and end up in the Negeb of Judah , at beer - sheba .      thus they tour the whole land , reach Jerusalem again after nine month and twenty day .      Joab then report the census figure to the king : of man capable of wield a sword , there be in Israel eight hundred thousand , and in Judah five hundred thousand .     afterward , however , David regret having number the people . David say to the   Lord : I have sin grievously in what I have do .    take away ,   Lord , your servant guilt , for I have act very foolishly .        when David rise in the morning , the word of the   Lord   come to the prophet Gad , Davids seer , say :      go , tell David : thus say the   Lord : I be offer you three option ; choose one of they , and I will give you that .      Gad then go to David to inform he . he ask : should three year of famine come upon your land ; or three month of flee from your enemy while he pursue you ; or be it to be three day of plague in your land ? now consider well : what answer be I to give to he who send I ?        David answer Gad : I be greatly distressed . but let we fall into the hand of God , whose mercy be great , rather than into human hand .      thus David choose the plague . at the time of the wheat harvest it break out among the people . the   Lord   send plague over Israel from morning until the time appoint , and from Dan to Beer - sheba seventy thousand of the people die .      but when the angel stretch forth his hand toward Jerusalem to destroy it , the   Lord   change his mind about the calamity , and say to the angel cause the destruction among the people : enough now ! stay your hand .    the angel of the   Lord   be then stand at the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite .        when David see the angel who be strike the people , he say to the   Lord : it be I who have sin ; it be I , the shepherd , who have do wrong . but these sheep , what have they do ? strike I and my father family !    David Offers Sacrifices .     on the same day Gad go to David and say to he , go and set up an altar to the   Lord   on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite .      accord to Gads word , David go up as the   Lord   have command .      now Araunah look down and see the king and his servant come toward he while he be threshing wheat . so he go out and bow down before the king , his face to the ground .      then Araunah ask , why do my lord the king come to his servant ? David reply , to buy the threshing floor from you , to build an altar to the   Lord , that the plague may be withdraw from the people .       but Araunah say to David : let my lord the king take it and offer up what be good in his sight . see , here be the oxen for burn offering , and the threshing sledge and the yoke of oxen for wood .      all this do Araunah give to the king . Araunah then say to the king , may the   Lord   your God accept your offering .      the king , however , reply to Araunah , no , I will buy it from you at the proper price , for I can not sacrifice to the   Lord   my God burn offering that cost I nothing . so David buy the threshing floor and the oxen for fifty silver shekel .      then David build an altar to the   Lord   there , and sacrifice burn offering and communion offering . the   Lord   grant relief to the land , and the plague be withdraw from Israel .
