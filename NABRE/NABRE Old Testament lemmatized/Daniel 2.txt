Daniel go home and inform his companion Hananiah , Mishael , and Azariah ,      that they might implore the mercy of the God of heaven in regard to this mystery , so that Daniel and his companion might not perish with the rest of the wise man of Babylon .      during the night the mystery be reveal to Daniel in a vision , and he bless the God of heaven :     bless be the name of God forever and ever ,   for wisdom and power be his .   he cause the change of the time and season ,   establish king and depose they . he give wisdom to the wise   and knowledge to those who understand .   he reveal deep and hidden thing   and know what be in the darkness ,   for the light dwell with he .    to you , God of my ancestor ,   I give thank and praise ,   because you have give I wisdom and power . now you have show I what we ask of you ,   you have make known to we the king dream .     so Daniel go to Arioch , whom the king have appoint to destroy the wise man of Babylon , and say to he , do not put the wise man of Babylon to death . bring I before the king , and I will tell he the interpretation of the dream . Arioch quickly bring Daniel to the king and say ,      I have find a man among the judean exile who can give the interpretation to the king .      the king ask Daniel , whose name be Belteshazzar , can you tell I the dream that I have and its meaning ?      in the king presence Daniel make this reply : the mystery about which the king have inquire , the wise man , enchanter , magician , and diviner could not explain to the king .      but there be a God in heaven who reveal mystery , and he have show King Nebuchadnezzar what be to happen in the last day ; this be your dream , the vision    you see as you lay in bed .      to you in your bed there come thought about what should happen in the future , and he who reveal mystery show you what be to be .      to I also this mystery have be reveal ; not that I be wise than any other live person , but in order that its meaning may be make known to the king , that you may understand the thought of your own mind .     in your vision , o king , you see a statue , very large and exceedingly bright , terrifying in appearance as it stand before you .      its head be pure gold , its chest and arm be silver , its belly and thigh bronze ,      its leg iron , its foot partly iron and partly clay .        while you watch , a stone be hew from a mountain without a hand be put to it , and it strike its iron and clay foot , break they in piece .      the iron , clay , bronze , silver , and gold all crumble at once , fine as the chaff on the threshing floor in summer , and the wind blow they away without leave a trace . but the stone that strike the statue become a great mountain and fill the whole earth .      this be the dream ; the interpretation we shall also give in the king presence .      you , o king , be the king of king ; to you the God of heaven have give dominion and strength , power and glory ;      human being , wild beast , and bird of the air , wherever they may dwell , he have hand over to you , make you ruler over they all ; you be the head of gold .      another kingdom shall take your place , inferior to yours , then a third kingdom , of bronze , which shall rule over the whole earth .      there shall be a fourth kingdom , strong as iron ; it shall break in piece and subdue all these other , just as iron break in piece and crush everything else .      the foot and toe you see , partly of clay and partly of iron , mean that it shall be a divided kingdom , but yet have some of the hardness of iron . as you see the iron mix with clay tile ,      and the toe partly iron and partly clay , the kingdom shall be partly strong and partly fragile .      the iron mix with clay mean that they shall seal their alliance by intermarriage , but they shall not stay united , any more than iron mix with clay .      in the lifetime of those king the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that shall never be destroy or deliver up to another people ; rather , it shall break in piece all these kingdom and put an end to they , and it shall stand forever .       that be the meaning of the stone you see hew from the mountain without a hand be put to it , which break in piece the iron , bronze , clay , silver , and gold . the great God have reveal to the king what shall be in the future ; this be exactly what you dream , and its meaning be sure .     then King Nebuchadnezzar fall down and worship Daniel and order sacrifice and incense offer to he .      to Daniel the king say , truly your God be the God of god and Lord of king and a revealer of mystery ; that be why you be able to reveal this mystery .      he advance Daniel to a high post , give he many generous present , make he ruler of the whole province of Babylon and chief prefect over all the wise man of Babylon .      at Daniels request the king make Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego administrator of the province of Babylon , while Daniel himself remain at the king court .
