b '   Cities of Refuge .      when the   Lord , your God , cut down the nation whose land the   Lord , your God , be give you , and you have dispossess they and settle in their city and house ,        you shall set apart three city    in the land the   Lord , your God , be give you to possess .      you shall measure the distance and divide into three region the land of which the   Lord , your God , be give you possession , so that every homicide will be able to find a refuge .     this be the case of a homicide who may take refuge there and live : when someone strike down a neighbor unintentionally and not out of previous hatred .      for example , if someone go with a neighbor to a forest to cut wood , wield an ax to cut down a tree , and its head fly off the handle and hit the neighbor a mortal blow , such a person may take refuge in one of these city and live .      should the distance be too great , the avenger of blood    might in hot anger pursue , overtake , and strike the killer dead , even though that one do not deserve the death penalty since there have be no previous hatred ;      for this reason I command you : set apart three city .      but if the   Lord , your God , enlarge your territory , as he swear to your ancestor , and give you all the land he promise your ancestor he would give ,      because you carefully observe this whole commandment which I give you today , love the   Lord , your God , and ever walk in his way , then add three more city to these three .      thus , in the land which the   Lord , your God , be give you as a heritage , innocent blood will not be shed and you will not become guilty of bloodshed .      however , if someone , hate a neighbor , lie in wait , attack , and strike the neighbor dead , and then flee to one of these city ,      the elder of the killer own city shall send and have the killer take from there , to be hand over to the avenger of blood and slay .      do not show pity , but purge from Israel the innocent blood , so that it may go well with you .     Removal of Landmarks .     you shall not move your neighbor boundary marker    erect by your forebear in the heritage that will be allot to you in the land the   Lord , your God , be give you to possess .     false witness .      one witness alone shall not stand against someone in regard to any crime or any offense that may have be commit ; a charge shall stand only on the testimony of two or three witness .      if a hostile witness rise against someone to accuse that person of wrongdoing ,      the two party in the dispute shall appear in the presence of the   Lord , in the presence of the priest and judge in office at that time ,         and the judge must investigate it thoroughly . if the witness be a false witness and have falsely accuse the other ,        you shall do to the false witness just as that false witness plan to do to the other . thus shall you purge the evil from your midst .      the rest shall hear and be afraid , and never again do such an evil thing as this in your midst .        do not show pity . life for life ,    eye for eye , tooth for tooth , hand for hand , and foot for foot !
