b '   the Discourse of Wisdom    do not Wisdom call ,   and understand raise her voice ?    on the top of the height along the road ,   at the crossroad she take her stand ;   by the gate at the approach of the city ,   in the entryway she cry aloud :   to you , o people , I call ;   my appeal be to you mortal .   you naive one , gain prudence ,   you fool ,    gain sense .   listen ! for noble thing I speak ;   my lip proclaim honest word .    indeed , my mouth utter truth ,   and my lip abhor wickedness .   all the word of my mouth be sincere ,   none of they wily or crooked ;   all of they be straightforward to the intelligent ,   and right to those who attain knowledge .   take my instruction instead of silver ,   and knowledge rather than choice gold .   [ for wisdom be well than coral ,   and no treasure can compare with she .   ]   I , Wisdom , dwell with prudence ,   and useful knowledge I have .   [ the fear of the   Lord   be hatred of evil ; ] Pride , arrogance , the evil way ,   and the perverse mouth I hate .    Mine be counsel and advice ;   Mine be strength ; I be understand .    by I kings reign ,   and ruler enact justice ;   by I prince govern ,   and noble , all the judge of the earth .   those who love I I also love ,   and those who seek I find I .   with I be rich and honor ,    wealth that endure , and righteousness .   my fruit be well than gold , even pure gold ,   and my yield than choice silver .    on the way of righteousness I walk ,   along the path of justice ,   grant wealth to those who love I ,   and fill their treasury .      the   Lord   begot I , the beginning of his work ,   the forerunner of his deed of long ago ;    from of old I be form ,    at the first , before the earth .     when there be no deep I be bring forth ,   when there be no fountain or spring of water ;   before the mountain be settle into place ,   before the hill , I be bring forth ;   when the earth and the field be not yet make ,   nor the first clod of the world .   when he establish the heaven , there be I ,    when he mark out the vault over the face of the deep ;   when he make firm the sky above ,   when he fix fast the spring of the deep ;   when he set for the sea its limit ,   so that the water should not transgress his command ; when he fix the foundation of earth ,    then be I beside he as artisan ;    I be his delight day by day ,   play before he all the while ,   play over the whole of his earth ,   have my delight with human being .    now , child , listen to I ;   happy be they who keep my way .   listen to instruction and grow wise ,   do not reject it !   happy the one who listen to I ,   attend daily at my gate ,   keep watch at my doorpost ;   for whoever find I find life ,    and win favor from the   Lord ;   but those who pass I by do violence to themselves ;   all who hate I love death .
