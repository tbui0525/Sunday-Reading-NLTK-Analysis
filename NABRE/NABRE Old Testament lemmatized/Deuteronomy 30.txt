I call heaven and earth today to witness against you :    I have set before you life and death , the blessing and the curse . choose life , then , that you and your descendant may live ,      by love the   Lord , your God , obey his voice , and hold fast to he . for that will mean life for you , a long life for you to live on the land which the   Lord   swear to your ancestor , to Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob , to give to they .
