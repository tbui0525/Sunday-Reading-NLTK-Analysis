b '     then shall the righteous one with great assurance confront    his oppressor who set at nought his labor .    see this , the wicked shall be shake with dreadful fear ,   and be amazed at the unexpected salvation .   they shall say among themselves , rueful   and groan through anguish of spirit :    this be the one whom once we hold as a laughingstock   and as a type for mockery ,    fool that we be ! his life we account madness ,   and death dishonored .   see how he be account among the heavenly being ;    how his lot be with the holy one !    we , then , have stray from the way of truth ,    and the light of righteousness do not shine for we ,   and the sun do not rise for we .    we be entangle in the thorn of mischief and of ruin ;   we journey through trackless desert ,   but the way of the   Lord   we never know .   what do our pride avail we ?   what have wealth and its boastfulness afford we ?    all of they pass like a shadow   and like a fleeting rumor ;    like a ship traverse the heaving water :   when it have pass , no trace can be find ,   no path of its keel in the wave .   or like a bird fly through the air ;   no evidence of its course be to be found\xe2\x80\x94 but the fluid air , lash by the beating of pinion ,   and cleft by the rush force of speed wing , be traverse ;   and afterward no mark of passage can be find in it .   or as , when an arrow have be shoot at a mark ,   the part air straightway flow together again   so that none discern the way it went\xe2\x80\x94   even so , once bear , we abruptly come to nought   and hold no sign of virtue to display ,   but be consume in our wickedness .       yes , the hope of the wicked be like chaff bear by the wind ,   and like fine , storm - drive snow ; like smoke scatter by the wind ,   and like the pass memory of the nomad camping for a single day .    but the righteous live forever ,   and in the   Lord   be their recompense ,   and the thought of they be with the most high .    therefore shall they receive the splendid crown ,   the beautiful diadem , from the hand of the   Lord , for he will shelter they with his right hand ,   and protect they with his arm .    he shall take his zeal for armor    and arm creation to requite the enemy ,   shall put on righteousness for a breastplate ,   wear sure judgment for a helmet ,   shall take invincible holiness for a shield ,     and sharpen his sudden anger for a sword . the universe will war with he against the foolhardy ;   well - aim bolt of lightning will go forth   and from the cloud will leap to the mark as from a well - draw bow ;     and as from a sling , wrathful hailstone shall be hurl . the water of the sea will be enrage   and flood river will overwhelm they ;    a mighty wind will confront they   and winnow they like a tempest ; thus lawlessness will lay waste the whole earth   and evildoe overturn the throne of the mighty .
