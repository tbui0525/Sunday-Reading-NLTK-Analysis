b '   eighth plague : the Locusts .     then the   Lord   say to Moses : go to Pharaoh , for I have make he and his servant obstinate in order that I may perform these sign of mine among they      and that you may recount to your son and grandson how I make a fool of the Egyptians and what sign I do among they , so that you may know that I be the   Lord .      so Moses and Aaron go to Pharaoh and tell he , thus say the   Lord , the God of the Hebrews : how long will you refuse to submit to I ? let my people go to serve I .      for if you refuse to let my people go , tomorrow I will bring locust into your territory .      they will cover the surface of the earth , so that the earth itself will not be visible . they will eat up the remnant you save undamaged from the hail , as well as all the tree that be grow in your field .      they will fill your house and the house of your servant and of all the egyptians\xe2\x80\x94something your parent and your grandparent have not see from the day they appear on this soil until today . with that he turn and leave Pharaoh .     but Pharaohs servant say to he , how long will he be a snare for we ? let the people go to serve the   Lord , their God . do you not yet realize that Egypt be be destroy ?      so Moses and Aaron be bring back to Pharaoh , who say to they , go , serve the   Lord , your God . but who exactly will go ?      Moses answer , with our young and old we must go ; with our son and daughter , with our flock and herd we must go . it be a pilgrimage feast of the   Lord   for we .      the   Lord   help you ,    Pharaoh reply , if I let your little one go with you ! clearly , you have some evil in mind .      by no means ! just you man go and serve the   Lord .    after all , that be what you have be ask for . with that they be drive from Pharaohs presence .      the   Lord   then say to Moses : stretch out your hand over the land of Egypt for the locust , that they may come upon it and eat up all the land vegetation , whatever the hail have leave .      so Moses stretch out his staff over the land of Egypt , and the   Lord   drive an east wind    over the land all that day and all night . when it be morning , the east wind bring the locust .      the locust come up over the whole land of Egypt and settle down over all its territory . never before have there be such a fierce swarm of locust , nor will there ever be again .      they cover the surface of the whole land , so that it become black . they eat up all the vegetation in the land and all the fruit of the tree the hail have spare . nothing green be leave on any tree or plant in the field throughout the land of Egypt .     Pharaoh hurriedly summon Moses and Aaron and say , I have sin against the   Lord , your God , and against you .      but now , do forgive I my sin only this once , and pray to the   Lord , your God , only to take this death from I .      when Moses leave Pharaoh , he pray to the   Lord ,      and the   Lord   cause the wind to shift to a very strong west wind , which take up the locust and hurl they into the Red Sea .    not a single locust remain within the whole territory of Egypt .      yet the   Lord   harden Pharaohs heart , and he would not let the Israelites go .    ninth plague : the darkness .      then the   Lord   say to Moses : stretch out your hand toward the sky , that over the land of Egypt there may be such darkness    that one can feel it .      so Moses stretch out his hand toward the sky , and there be dense darkness throughout the land of Egypt for three day .      People could not see one another , nor could they get up from where they be , for three day . but all the Israelites have light where they live .     Pharaoh then summon Moses and Aaron and say , go , serve the   Lord . only your flock and herd will be detain . even your little one may go with you .      but Moses reply , you also must give we sacrifice and burn offering to make to the   Lord , our God .      our livestock also must go with we . not an animal must be leave behind , for some of they we will select for service    to the   Lord , our God ; but we will not know with which one we be to serve the   Lord   until we arrive there .      but the   Lord   harden Pharaohs heart , and he be unwilling to let they go .      Pharaoh say to Moses , leave I , and see to it that you do not see my face again ! for the day you do see my face you will die !      Moses reply , you be right ! I will never see your face again .             '
