b '   Advantages of Fidelity .     now therefore , Israel , hear the statute and ordinance I be teach you to observe , that you may live , and may enter in and take possession of the land which the   Lord , the God of your ancestor , be give you .        in your observance of the commandment of the   Lord , your God ,    which I be command you , you shall not add to what I command you nor subtract from it .      you have see with your own eye what the   Lord   do at Baal - peor :    the   Lord , your God , destroy from your midst everyone who follow the Baal of Peor ;      but you , who hold fast to the   Lord , your God , be all alive today .      see , I be teach you the statute and ordinance as the   Lord , my God , have command I , that you may observe they in the land you be enter to possess .      observe they carefully , for this be your wisdom and discernment in the sight of the people , who will hear of all these statute and say , this great nation be truly a wise and discern people .         for what great nation be there that have god so close to it as the   Lord , our God , be to we whenever we call upon he ?      or what great nation have statute and ordinance that be as just as this whole law which I be set before you today ?     Revelation at Horeb .     however , be on your guard and be very careful not to forget the thing your own eye have see , nor let they slip from your heart as long as you live , but make they known to your child    and to your children child ,      that day you stand before the   Lord , your God , at Horeb , when the   Lord   say to I : assemble the people for I , that I may let they hear my word , that they may learn to fear    I as long as they live in the land and may so teach their child .       you come near and stand at the foot of the mountain , while the mountain blaze to the heart of the heaven with fire and be envelop in a dense black cloud .      then the   Lord   speak to you from the midst of the fire .    you hear the sound of the word , but see no form ; there be only a voice .      he proclaim to you his covenant , which he command you to keep : the ten word ,    which he write on two stone tablet .        at that time the   Lord   charge I to teach you the statute and ordinance for you to observe in the land you be about to cross into and possess .    Danger of Idolatry .     because you see no form at all on the day the   Lord   speak to you at Horeb from the midst of the fire , be strictly on your guard      not to act corruptly by fashion an idol for yourself to represent any figure , whether it be the form of a man or of a woman ,        the form of any animal on the earth , the form of any bird that fly in the sky ,      the form of anything that crawl on the ground , or the form of any fish in the water under the earth .      and when you look up to the heaven and behold the sun or the moon or the star , the whole heavenly host , do not be lead astray into bow down to they and serve they .    these the   Lord , your God , have apportion to all the other nation under the heaven ;      but you the   Lord   have take and lead out of that iron foundry , Egypt , that you might be his people , his heritage , as you be today .        but the   Lord   be angry with I on your account    and swear that I should not cross the Jordan nor enter the good land which the   Lord , your God , be give you as a heritage .      I myself shall die in this country ; I shall not cross the Jordan ; but you be go to cross over and take possession of that good land .        be careful , therefore , lest you forget the covenant which the   Lord , your God , have make with you , and fashion for yourself against his command an idol in any form whatsoever .        for the   Lord , your God , be a consume fire , a jealous God .      Gods Fidelity and Love .      when you have child and children child , and have grow old in the land , should you then act corruptly by fashion an idol in the form of anything , and by this evil do in his sight provoke the   Lord , your God ,      I call heaven and earth this day to witness against you , that you shall all quickly perish from the land which you be cross the Jordan to possess . you shall not live in it for any length of time but shall be utterly wipe out .        the   Lord   will scatter you among the people , and there shall remain but a handful of you among the nation to which the   Lord   will drive you .      there you shall serve god that be work of human hand , of wood and stone , god which can neither see nor hear , neither eat nor smell .        yet when you seek the   Lord , your God , from there , you shall indeed find he if you search after he with all your heart and soul .        in your distress , when all these thing shall have come upon you , you shall finally return to the   Lord , your God , and listen to his voice .      since the   Lord , your God , be a merciful God , he will not abandon or destroy you , nor forget the covenant with your ancestor that he swear to they .      ask now of the day of old , before your time , ever since God create humankind upon the earth ; ask from one end of the sky to the other : do anything so great ever happen before ? be it ever hear of ?      do a people ever hear the voice of God speak from the midst of fire , as you do , and live ?        or do any god venture to go and take a nation for himself from the midst of another nation , by testing , by sign and wonder ,    by war , with strong hand and outstretched arm , and by great terror , all of which the   Lord , your God , do for you in Egypt before your very eye ?      all this you be allow to see that you might know that the   Lord   be God ; there be no other .        out of the heaven he let you hear his voice to discipline you ; on earth he let you see his great fire , and you hear he speak out of the fire .      for love of your ancestor he choose their descendant after they and by his presence and great power lead you out of Egypt ,      dispossess before you nation great and mighty than you , so as to bring you in and to give their land to you as a heritage , as it be today .      this be why you must now acknowledge , and fix in your heart , that the   Lord   be God in the heaven above and on earth below , and that there be no other .        and you must keep his statute and commandment which I command you today , that you and your child after you may prosper , and that you may have long life on the land which the   Lord , your God , be give you forever .     Cities of Refuge .      then Moses set apart three city in the region east of the Jordan ,      to which a homicide might flee who kill a neighbor unintentionally , where there have be no hatred previously , so that the killer might flee to one of these city and live :      Bezer in the wilderness , in the region of the plateau , for the Reubenites ; Ramoth in Gilead for the Gadites ; and Golan in Bashan for the Manassites .
