b ' a Lament over Gods promise to David   A   maskil   of Ethan the Ezrahite .    a I   I will sing of your mercy forever ,   Lord    proclaim your faithfulness through all age .    for I say , my mercy be establish forever ;   my faithfulness will stand as long as the heavens .   I have make a covenant with my choose one ;   I have swear to David my servant :   I will make your dynasty stand forever   and establish your throne through all age .   Selah    II   the heaven praise your marvel ,   Lord ,   your loyalty in the assembly of the holy one .    who in the sky rank with the   Lord ?   who be like the   Lord   among the son of the god ?     a God dread in the council of the holy one ,   great and more awesome than all those around he !   Lord , God of host , who be like you ?   Mighty   Lord , your faithfulness surround you .   you rule the rage sea ;    you still its swell wave .   you crush Rahab    with a mortal blow ;   with your strong arm you scatter your foe .   yours be the heavens , yours the earth ;   you found the world and everything in it .     Zaphon and Amanus you create ;   Tabor and Hermon rejoice in your name .   you have a mighty arm .   your hand be strong ; your right hand be ever exalt .   Justice and judgment be the foundation of your throne ;   mercy and faithfulness march before you .    bless the people who know the war cry ,   who walk in the radiance of your face ,   Lord .   in your name they sing joyfully all the day ;   they rejoice in your righteousness .    you be their majestic strength ;   by your favor our horn    be exalt .    truly the   Lord   be our shield ,   the Holy One of Israel , our king !     III   then you speak in vision ;    to your faithful one you say : I have set a leader over the warrior ;   I have raise up a choose one from the people .   I have choose David , my servant ;   with my holy oil I have anoint he .   my hand will be with he ;    my arm will make he strong .   no enemy shall outwit he ,   nor shall the wicked defeat he .   I will crush his foe before he ,   strike down those who hate he .   my faithfulness and mercy will be with he ;   through my name his horn will be exalt .    I will set his hand upon the sea ,   his right hand upon the river .   he shall cry to I , you be my father ,    my God , the Rock of my salvation !   I myself make he the firstborn ,   Most High    over the king of the earth .   forever I will maintain my mercy for he ;    my covenant with he stand firm .   I will establish his dynasty forever ,   his throne as the day of the heaven .   if his descendant forsake my teaching ,    do not follow my decree ,   if they fail to observe my statute ,   do not keep my commandment ,   I will punish their crime with a rod   and their guilt with blow .   but I will not take my mercy from he ,   nor will I betray my bond of faithfulness .    I will not violate my covenant ;   the promise of my lip I will not alter .    by my holiness I swear once for all :    I will never be false to David .    his dynasty will continue forever ,    his throne , like the sun before I .   like the moon it will stand eternal ,   forever firm like the sky ! Selah    B IV   but now you have reject and spurn ,    be enrage at your anoint .   you renounce the covenant with your servant ,   defile his crown in the dust .   you break down all city wall ,    leave his stronghold in ruin .   all who pass through seize plunder ;   his neighbor deride he .   you have exalt the right hand of his foe ,   have gladden all his enemy .    you turn back his sharp sword ,   do not support he in battle .   you bring to an end his splendor ,   hurl his throne to the ground .   you cut short the day of his youth ,   cover he with shame . Selah V   how long ,   Lord ? will you hide forever ?   must your wrath smolder like fire ?    remember how brief life be ,   how frail the son of man you have create !    what be man , that he should live and not see death ?   who can deliver his soul from the power of Sheol ?   Selah VI   where be your former mercy , Lord ,   that you swear to David in your faithfulness ?   remember , Lord , the insult to your servant ,   how I have bear in my bosom the slander of the nation .    your enemy ,   Lord , insult ;   they insult each step of your anoint .    bless be the   Lord   forever ! amen and amen !
