b '    Baruch , the Scribe of Jeremiah .     in the fourth year of Jehoiakim , son of Josiah , king of Judah , this word come to Jeremiah from the   Lord :      take a scroll and write on it all the word I have speak to you about Israel , Judah , and all the nation , from the day I first speak to you , from the day of Josiah , until today .      perhaps , if the house of Judah hear all the evil I have in mind to do to they , so that all of they turn from their evil way , then I can forgive their wickedness and their sin .        so Jeremiah call Baruch , son of Neriah , and he write down on a scroll what Jeremiah say , all the word which the   Lord   have speak to he .      then Jeremiah command Baruch : I can not enter the house of the   Lord ; I be bar    from it .      so you yourself must go . on a fast day in the hearing of the people in the   Lord s house , read the word of the   Lord   from the scroll you write at my dictation ; read they also to all the people of Judah who come up from their city .      perhaps they will present their supplication before the   Lord   and will all turn back from their evil way ; for great be the anger and wrath with which the   Lord   have threaten this people .      Baruch , son of Neriah , do everything Jeremiah the prophet command ; from the scroll he read the   Lord s word in the   Lord s house .      in the ninth month , in the fifth year of Jehoiakim , son of Josiah , king of Judah , all the people of Jerusalem and all those who come from Judahs city to Jerusalem proclaim a fast before the   Lord .      so Baruch read the word of Jeremiah from the scroll in the room of Gemariah ,    son of the scribe Shaphan , in the upper court of the   Lord s house , at the entrance of the New Temple Gate , in the hearing of all the people .     Now Micaiah , son of Gemariah , son of Shaphan , hear all the word of the   Lord   read from the scroll .      so he go down to the house of the king , into the scribe chamber ,    where the prince be meet in session : Elishama , the scribe ; Delaiah , son of Shemaiah ; Elnathan , son of Achbor ; Gemariah , son of Shaphan ; Zedekiah , son of Hananiah ; and the other prince .      Micaiah report to they all that he have hear Baruch read from his scroll in the hearing of the people .      the prince immediately send Jehudi , son of Nethaniah , son of Shelemiah , son of Cushi , to Baruch with the order : the scroll you read in the hearing of the people\xe2\x80\x94bre it with you and come . scroll in hand , Baruch , son of Neriah , go to they .      sit down , they say to he , and read it in our hearing . Baruch read it in their hearing ,      and when they have hear all its word , they turn to each other in alarm and say to Baruch , we have to tell the king all these thing .      then they ask Baruch : tell we , please , how do you come to write down all these word ? be it at his dictation ?      yes , he would dictate all these word to I , Baruch answer they , while I write they down with ink in the scroll .      the prince say to Baruch , go into hiding , you and Jeremiah ; do not let anyone know where you be .     they go in to the king , into the courtyard ; they have deposit the scroll in the room of Elishama the scribe . when they tell the king everything that have happen ,      the king send Jehudi to get the scroll . Jehudi bring it from the room of Elishama the scribe , and read it to the king and to all the prince who be attend the king .      now the king be sit in his winter house , since it be the ninth month , and a fire be burn in the brazier before he .      each time Jehudi finish read three or four column , he would cut off the piece with a scribe knife    and throw it into the fire in the brazier , until the entire scroll be consume in the fire in the brazier .      as they be listen to all these word the king and all his official do not become alarmed , nor do they tear their garment .      and though Elnathan , Delaiah , and Gemariah urge the king not to burn the scroll , he would not listen to they .      he command Jerahmeel , a royal prince , and Seraiah , son of Azriel , and Shelemiah , son of Abdeel , to arrest Baruch , the scribe , and Jeremiah the prophet . but the   Lord   have hide they away .     the word of the   Lord   come to Jeremiah , after the king burn the scroll and the word Jeremiah have dictate to Baruch :      take another scroll , and write on it all the word in the first scroll , which Jehoiakim , king of Judah , burn .      and against Jehoiakim , king of Judah , say this : thus say the   Lord : you be the one who burn that scroll , say , why do you write on it : Babylons king shall surely come and ravage this land , empty it of every living thing ?      the   Lord   now say of Jehoiakim , king of Judah :    no descendant of his shall sit on Davids throne ; his corpse shall be throw out , expose to heat by day , frost by night .        I will punish he and his descendant and his official for their wickedness ; upon they , the inhabitant of Jerusalem , and the people of Judah I will bring all the evil threat to which they do not listen .     then Jeremiah take another scroll and give it to his scribe , Baruch , son of Neriah , who write on it at Jeremiahs dictation all the word contain in the scroll which Jehoiakim , king of Judah , have burn in the fire , add many word like they .
