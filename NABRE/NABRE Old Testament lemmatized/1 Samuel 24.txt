b '   David Spares Saul .      David then go up from there and stay in the stronghold of Engedi .      when Saul return from the pursuit of the Philistines , he be tell that David be in the desert near Engedi .      so Saul take three thousand of the good man from all Israel and go in search of David and his man in the direction of the wild goat crag .      when he come to the sheepfold along the way , he find a cave , which he enter to relieve himself . David and his man be occupy the inmost recess of the cave .      Davids servant say to he , this be the day about which the   Lord   say to you : I will deliver your enemy into your hand ; do with he as you see fit . so David move up and stealthily cut off an end of Sauls robe .      afterward , however , David regret that he have cut off an end of Sauls robe .        he say to his man , the   Lord   forbid that I should do such a thing to my master , the   Lord s anoint , to lay a hand on he , for he be the   Lord s anoint .        with these word David restrain his man and would not permit they to attack Saul . Saul then leave the cave and go on his way .      David also step out of the cave , call to Saul , my lord the king ! when Saul look back , David bow , his face to the ground in homage ,      and ask Saul : why do you listen to those who say , David be try to harm you ?      you see for yourself today that the   Lord   just now deliver you into my hand in the cave . I be tell to kill you , but I take pity on you instead . I decide , I will not raise a hand against my master , for he be the   Lord s anoint .      look here , my father . see the end of your robe which I hold . I cut off an end of your robe and do not kill you . now see and be convince that I plan no harm and no rebellion . I have do you no wrong , though you be hunt I down to take my life .        may the   Lord   judge between I and you . may the   Lord   exact justice from you in my case . I shall not lay a hand on you .      as the old proverb say , from the wicked come wickedness . thus I will not lay a hand on you .      what be the king of Israel attack ? what be you pursue ? a dead dog ! a single flea !        the   Lord   will be the judge to decide between we . may the   Lord   see this , defend my cause , and give I justice against you !     Sauls Remorse .     when David finish say these thing to Saul , Saul answer , be that your voice , my son David ? and he weep freely .      Saul then admit to David : you be more in the right than I be . you have treat I graciously , while I have treat you badly .      you have declare this day how you treat I graciously : the   Lord   deliver I into your hand and you do not kill I .      for if someone come upon an enemy , do they send they graciously on their way ? so may the   Lord   reward you graciously for what you have do this day .      and now , since I know that you will certainly become king and that the kingship over Israel shall come into your possession ,        swear to I by the   Lord   that you will not cut off my descendant and that you will not blot out my name from my father house .        David give Saul his oath and Saul return home , while David and his man go up to the stronghold .             '
