b '   Nathans Parable .      the   Lord   send Nathan to David , and when he come to he , he say : tell I how you judge this case : in a certain town there be two man , one rich , the other poor .        the rich man have flock and herd in great number .      but the poor man have nothing at all except one little ewe lamb that he have buy . he nourish she , and she grow up with he and his child . of what little he have she eat ; from his own cup she drink ; in his bosom she sleep ; she be like a daughter to he .      now , a visitor come to the rich man , but he spare his own flock and herd to prepare a meal for the traveler who have come to he : he take the poor mans ewe lamb and prepare it for the one who have come to he .      David grow very angry with that man and say to Nathan : as the   Lord   live , the man who have do this deserve death !      he shall make fourfold restitution    for the lamb because he have do this and be unsparing .        then Nathan say to David : you be the man ! Nathans Indictment .   thus say the   Lord   God of Israel : I anoint you king over Israel . I deliver you from the hand of Saul .        I give you your lord house and your lord wife for your own . I give you the house of Israel and of Judah . and if this be not enough , I could count up for you still more .      why have you despise the   Lord   and do what be evil in his sight ? you have cut down Uriah the Hittite with the sword ; his wife you take as your own , and he you kill with the sword of the Ammonites .      now , therefore , the sword shall never depart from your house , because you have despise I and have take the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your wife .        thus say the   Lord : I will bring evil upon you out of your own house . I will take your wife before your very eye , and will give they to your neighbor : he shall lie with your wife in broad daylight .         you have act in secret , but I will do this in the presence of all Israel , in the presence of the sun itself .    Davids Repentance .     then David say to Nathan , I have sin against the   Lord . Nathan answer David : for his part , the   Lord   have remove your sin . you shall not die ,        but since you have utterly spurn the   Lord   by this deed , the child bear to you will surely die .      then Nathan return to his house . the   Lord   strike the child that the wife of Uriah have bear to David , and it become desperately ill .      David plead with God on behalf of the child . he keep a total fast , and spend the night lie on the ground clothe in sackcloth .      the elder of his house stand beside he to get he to rise from the ground ; but he would not , nor would he take food with they .      on the seventh day , the child die . Davids servant be afraid to tell he that the child be dead , for they say : when the child be alive , we speak to he , but he would not listen to what we say . how can we tell he the child be dead ? he may do some harm !      but David notice his servant whisper among themselves and realize that the child be dead . he ask his servant , be the child dead ? they say , yes .      rise from the ground , David wash and anoint himself , and change his clothe . then he go to the house of the   Lord   and worship . he return to his own house and ask for food ; they set it before he , and he eat .      his servant say to he : what be this you be do ? while the child be live , you fast and weep and keep vigil ; now that the child be dead , you rise and take food .      he reply : while the child be live , I fast and weep , think , who know ? the   Lord   may grant I the child life .      but now he be dead . why should I fast ? can I bring he back again ? I shall go to he , but he will not return to I .        then David console Bathsheba his wife . he go and sleep with she ; and she conceive and bear he a son , who be name Solomon . the   Lord   love he      and send the prophet Nathan to name he Jedidiah ,    on behalf of the   Lord .    end of the Ammonite War .      Joab fight against Rabbah of the Ammonites and capture that royal city .      he send messenger to David to say : I have fight against Rabbah and have take the water - city .      therefore , assemble the rest of the soldier , join the siege against the city , and capture it , lest I be the one to capture the city and mine be the name people mention , not yours .      so David assemble the rest of the soldier , go to Rabbah , fight against it , and capture it .      he take the crown of Milcom from the idol head , a talent    of gold in weight , with precious stone ; this crown David wear on his own head . he also bring out a great amount of spoil from the city .      he deport the people of the city and set they to work with saw , iron pick , and iron axis , or put they to work at the brickmold . he deal thus with all the city of the Ammonites . then David and his whole army return to Jerusalem .
