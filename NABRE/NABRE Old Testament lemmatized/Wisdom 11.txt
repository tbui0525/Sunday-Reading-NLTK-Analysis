b '    she prosper their affair through the holy prophet .     introduction   they journey through the uninhabited desert ,   and in lonely place they pitch their tent ;     they withstand enemy and ward off their foe .    when they thirst , they call upon you ,   and water be give they from the sheer rock ,   a quenching of their thirst from the hard stone .   for by the thing through which their foe be punish   they in their need be benefit .     First example : Water Punishes the Egyptians and Benefits the Israelites   instead of a river    perennial source ,   trouble with impure blood     as a rebuke to the decree for the slaying of infant , you give they abundant water beyond their hope ,    after you have show by the thirst they experience   how you punish their adversary .   for when they have be try , though only mildly chastise ,    they recognize how the wicked , condemn in anger , be be torment .   you test your own people , admonish they as a father ;   but as a stern king you probe and condemn the wicked .   those near and far be equally afflict :     for a twofold grief    take hold of they    and a groaning at the remembrance of the one who have depart .   for when they hear that the cause of their own torment   be a benefit to these other , they recognize the Lord .   for though they have mock and reject he who have be cast out and abandon long ago ,   in the final outcome , they marvel at he ,   since their thirst prove unlike that of the righteous .     Second example : animal punish the Egyptians and benefit the Israelites   in return for their senseless , wicked thought ,   which mislead they into worship dumb    serpent and worthless insect , you send upon they swarm of dumb creature for vengeance ;     that they might recognize that one be punish by the very thing through which one sin .     Digression on Gods Mercy   for not without mean be your almighty hand ,    that have fashion the universe from formless matter ,    to send upon they many bear or fierce lion ,   or newly create , wrathful , unknown beast   breathe forth fiery breath , or pour out roar smoke ,   or flash terrible spark from their eye .   not only could these attack and completely destroy they ;   even their frightful appearance itself could slay .   even without these , they could have be kill at a single blast ,   pursue by justice   and winnow by your mighty spirit . but you have dispose all thing by measure and number and weight .    for great strength be always present with you ;   who can resist the might of your arm ?    indeed , before you the whole universe be like a grain from a balance ,    or a drop of morning dew come down upon the earth .       but you have mercy on all , because you can do all thing ;   and you overlook sin for the sake of repentance .    for you love all thing that be   and loathe nothing that you have make ;   for you would not fashion what you hate .    how could a thing remain , unless you will it ;   or be preserve , have it not be call forth by you ?    but you spare all thing , because they be yours ,   O Ruler and Lover of soul ,     for your imperishable spirit be in all thing !
