b '     gather , gather yourselves together ,   o nation without shame !   before you be drive away ,   like chaff that disappear ; before there come upon you   the blaze anger of the   Lord ; before there come upon you   the day of the   Lord s anger .   seek the   Lord ,   all you humble of the land ,   who have observe his law ; seek justice ,   seek humility ; perhaps you will be shelter   on the day of the   Lord s anger .     judgment on the nation   for Gaza shall be forsake ,   and Ashkelon shall be a waste , Ashdod they shall drive out at midday ,   and Ekron    shall be uproot .    ah ! you who dwell by the seacoast ,   the nation of Cherethites ,    the word of the   Lord   be against you ! o Canaan , land of the Philistines ,   I will leave you to perish without an inhabitant !   you shall become field for shepherd ,   and fold for flock .   the seacoast shall belong   to the remnant of the house of Judah ;   by the sea they shall pasture . in the house of Ashkelon   they shall lie down in the evening . for the   Lord   their God will take care of they ,   and bring about their restoration .     I have hear the taunt utter by Moab ,   and the insult of the Ammonites ,   when they taunt my people   and make boast against their territory .    therefore , as I live\xe2\x80\x94   oracle of the   Lord   of hosts\xe2\x80\x94   the God of Israel , Moab shall become like Sodom ,   the Ammonites like Gomorrah : a field of weed ,   a salt pit ,   a waste forever . the remnant of my people shall plunder they ,   the survivor of my nation dispossess they .   this will be the recompense for their pride ,   because they taunt and boast against   the people of the   Lord   of host .   the   Lord   shall inspire they with terror   when he make all the god of earth waste away ; then the distant shore of the nation ,   each from its own place ,   shall bow down to he .     you too , o Cushites ,    shall be slay by the sword of the   Lord .    he will stretch out his hand against the north ,   to destroy Assyria ; he will make Nineveh a waste ,   dry as the desert .    in her midst flock shall lie down ,   all the wild life of the hollow ; the screech owl and the desert owl   shall roost in her column ; the owl shall hoot from the window ,   the raven croak from the doorway .    be this the exultant city    that dwelt secure , that tell itself ,   I and there be no one else ? how it have become a waste ,   a lair for wild animal ! those who pass by it   hiss , and shake their fist !
