b '   the Resurrection   at that time there shall arise Michael ,    the great prince ,   guardian of your people ; it shall be a time unsurpassed in distress   since the nation begin until that time . at that time your people shall escape ,   everyone who be find write in the book .    many of those who sleep    in the dust of the earth shall awake ; some to everlasting life ,   other to reproach and everlasting disgrace .    but those with insight shall shine brightly   like the splendor of the firmament , and those who lead the many to justice   shall be like the star    forever .      as for you , Daniel , keep secret the message and seal the book until the end time ; many shall wander aimlessly and evil shall increase .     I , Daniel , look and see two other , one stand on either bank of the river .      one of they say to the man clothe in linen , who be upstream , how long shall it be to the end of these appalling thing ?      the man clothe in linen ,    who be upstream , lift his hand to heaven ; and I hear he swear by he who live forever that it should be for a time , two time , and half a time ;    and that , when the power of the destroyer of the holy people be bring to an end , all these thing should end .      I hear , but I do not understand ; so I ask , my lord , what follow this ?      go , Daniel , he say , because the word be to be keep secret and seal until the end time .      many shall be refine , purify , and test , but the wicked shall prove wicked ; the wicked shall have no understanding , but those with insight shall .       from the time that the daily sacrifice be abolish and the desolating abomination be set up , there shall be one thousand two hundred and ninety day .      bless be they who have patience and persevere for the one thousand three hundred and thirty - five day .      go , take your rest , you shall rise for your reward at the end of day .
