b '   Revelation to Samuel .     during the time young Samuel be minister to the   Lord   under Eli , the word of the   Lord   be scarce and vision infrequent .       one day Eli be asleep in his usual place . his eye have lately grow so weak that he could not see .      the lamp of God be not yet extinguish ,    and Samuel be sleep in the temple of the   Lord   where the ark of God be .        the   Lord   call to Samuel , who answer , here I be .      he run to Eli and say , here I be . you call I . I do not call you , Eli answer . go back to sleep . so he go back to sleep .      again the   Lord   call Samuel , who rise and go to Eli . here I be , he say . you call I . but he answer , I do not call you , my son . go back to sleep .     Samuel do not yet recognize the   Lord , since the word of the   Lord   have not yet be reveal to he .      the   Lord   call Samuel again , for the third time . get up and go to Eli , he say , here I be . you call I . then Eli understand that the   Lord   be call the youth .      so he say to Samuel , go to sleep , and if you be call , reply , speak ,   Lord , for your servant be listen . when Samuel go to sleep in his place ,      the   Lord   come and stand there , call out as before : Samuel , Samuel ! Samuel answer , speak , for your servant be listen .      the   Lord   say to Samuel : I be about to do something in Israel that will make the ear of everyone who hear it ring .        on that day I will carry out against Eli everything I have say about his house , begin to end .      I announce to he that I be condemn his house once and for all , because of this crime : though he know his son be blaspheme God , he do not reprove they .        therefore , I swear to Elis house : no sacrifice or offering will ever expiate its crime .        Samuel then sleep until morning , when he get up early and open the door of the temple of the   Lord . he be afraid to tell Eli the vision ,      but Eli call to he , Samuel , my son ! he reply , here I be .      then Eli ask , what do he say to you ? hide nothing from I ! may God do thus to you , and more ,    if you hide from I a single thing he tell you .      so Samuel tell he everything , and hold nothing back . Eli answer , it be the   Lord . what be pleasing in the   Lord s sight , the   Lord   will do .    Samuel acknowledge as Prophet .     Samuel grow up , and the   Lord   be with he , not permit any word of his to go unfulfilled .         thus all Israel from Dan to Beer - sheba come to know that Samuel be a trustworthy prophet of the   Lord .      the   Lord   continue to appear at Shiloh , manifest himself to Samuel at Shiloh through his word . Samuels word spread throughout Israel .             '
