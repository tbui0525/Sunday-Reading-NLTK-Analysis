I be a Philistine , and you be Sauls servant . choose one of your man , and have he come down to I .      if he beat I in combat and kill I , we will be your vassal ; but if I beat he and kill he , you shall be our vassal and serve we .      the Philistine continue : I defy the rank of Israel today . give I a man and let we fight together .      when Saul and all Israel hear this challenge of the Philistine , they be stunned and terrify . David come to the Camp .        David be the son of an Ephrathite name Jesse from Bethlehem in Judah who have eight son . in the day of Saul Jesse be old and well on in year .        the three old son of Jesse have follow Saul to war ; the name of these three son who have go off to war be Eliab the firstborn ; Abinadab the second ; and Shammah the third .      David be the young . while the three old have join Saul ,      David would come and go from Sauls presence to tend his father sheep at Bethlehem .      meanwhile the Philistine come forward and take his stand morning and evening for forty day .     now Jesse say to his son David : take this ephah of roasted grain and these ten loaf for your brother , and bring they quickly to your brother in the camp .      also take these ten cheese for the field officer . greet your brother and bring home some token from they .      Saul and your brother , together with all Israel , be at war with the Philistines in the valley of the Elah .      early the next morning , having leave the flock with a shepherd , David pack up and set out , as Jesse have command he . he reach the barricade of the camp just as the army , on their way to the battleground , be shout their battle cry .        the Israelites and the Philistines draw up opposite each other in battle array .      David entrust what he have bring to the keeper of the baggage and hasten to the battle line , where he greet his brother .        while he be talk with they , the philistine champion , by name Goliath of Gath , come up from the rank of the Philistines and speak as before , and David listen .      when the Israelites see the man , they all retreat before he , terrify .      the Israelites have be say : do you see this man come up ? he come up to insult Israel . the king will make whoever kill he a very wealthy man . he will give his daughter to he and declare his father family exempt from taxis in Israel .        David now say to the man stand near he : how will the man who kill this Philistine and free Israel from disgrace be reward ? who be this uncircumcised Philistine that he should insult the army of the live God ?        they repeat the same word to he and say , that be how the man who kill he will be reward .      when Eliab , his old brother , hear he speak with the man , he grow angry with David and say : why do you come down ? with whom have you leave those sheep in the wilderness ? I know your arrogance and dishonest heart . you come down to enjoy the battle !        David protest , what have I do now ? I be only talk .      he turn from he to another and ask the same question ; and everyone give he the same answer as before .      the word that David have speak be overhear and report to Saul , who send for he .    David challenge Goliath .     then David speak to Saul : my lord should not lose heart . let your servant go and fight this Philistine .      but Saul answer David , you can not go up against this Philistine and fight with he , for you be only a youth , while he have be a warrior from his youth .       then David tell Saul : your servant use to tend his father sheep , and whenever a lion or bear come to carry off a sheep from the flock ,      I would chase after it , attack it , and snatch the prey from its mouth . if it attack I , I would seize it by the throat , strike it , and kill it .      your servant have kill both a lion and a bear . this uncircumcised Philistine will be as one of they , because he have insult the army of the live God .     David continue : the same   Lord   who deliver I from the claw of the lion and the bear will deliver I from the hand of this Philistine . Saul answer David , go ! the   Lord   will be with you .     Preparation for the Encounter .     then Saul dress David in his own tunic , put a bronze helmet on his head and arm he with a coat of mail .      David also fasten Sauls sword over the tunic . he walk with difficulty , however , since he have never wear armor before . he say to Saul , I can not go in these , because I be not use to they . so he take they off .      then , staff in hand , David select five smooth stone from the wadi and put they in the pocket of his shepherd bag . with his sling in hand , he approach the Philistine .    Davids Victory .      with his shield - bearer marching before he , the Philistine advance close and close to David .      when he size David up and see that he be youthful , ruddy , and handsome in appearance , he begin to deride he .      he say to David , be I a dog that you come against I with a staff ? then the Philistine curse David by his god      and say to he , come here to I , and I will feed your flesh to the bird of the air and the beast of the field .        David answer he : you come against I with sword and spear and scimitar , but I come against you in the name of the   Lord   of host , the God of the army of Israel whom you have insult .      today the   Lord   shall deliver you into my hand ; I will strike you down and cut off your head . this very day I will feed your dead body and the dead body of the philistine army to the bird of the air and the beast of the field ; thus the whole land shall learn that Israel have a God .      all this multitude , too , shall learn that it be not by sword or spear that the   Lord   save . for the battle belong to the   Lord , who shall deliver you into our hand .      the Philistine then move to meet David at close quarter , while David run quickly toward the battle line to meet the Philistine .      David put his hand into the bag and take out a stone , hurl it with the sling , and strike the Philistine on the forehead . the stone embed itself in his brow , and he fall on his face to the ground .      thus David triumph over the Philistine with sling and stone ; he strike the Philistine dead , and do it without a sword in his hand .        then David run and stand over he ; with the Philistines own sword which he draw from its sheath he kill he , and cut off his head .   Flight of the Philistines .   when the Philistines see that their hero be dead , they flee .      then the man of Israel and Judah spring up with a battle cry and pursue they to the approach of Gath and to the gate of Ekron , and Philistines fall wound along the road from Shaaraim as far as Gath and Ekron .      when they return from their pursuit of the Philistines , the Israelites loot their camp .       David take the head of the Philistine and bring it to Jerusalem ; but he keep Goliaths armor in his own tent .     David present to Saul .     as Saul watch David go out to meet the Philistine , he ask his general Abner , Abner , whose son be that young man ? Abner reply , on your life , o king , I have no idea .        and the king say , find out whose son the lad be .      so when David return from slay the Philistine , Abner escort he into Sauls presence . David be still hold the Philistines head .      Saul then ask he , whose son be you , young man ? David reply , I be the son of your servant Jesse of Bethlehem .             '
