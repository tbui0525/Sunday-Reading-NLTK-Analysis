b '   Exhortation to Trust in the Lord   listen to I , you who pursue justice ,   who seek the   Lord ; look to the rock from which you be hew ,   to the quarry    from which you be take ;    look to Abraham , your father ,   and to Sarah , who give you birth ; though he be but one when I call he ,   I bless he and make he many .    yes , the   Lord   shall comfort Zion ,   shall comfort all her ruin ; her wilderness he shall make like Eden ,   her wasteland like the garden of the   Lord ; Joy and gladness shall be find in she ,   thanksgiving and the sound of song .     be attentive to I , my people ;    my nation , give ear to I . for teaching shall go forth from I ,   and my judgment , as light to the people .    I will make my victory come swiftly ;   my salvation shall go forth   and my arm shall judge the nation ; in I the coastland shall hope ,   and my arm they shall await .     raise your eye to the heavens ,   look at the earth below ; though the heaven vanish like smoke ,   the earth wear out like a garment   and its inhabitant die like fly , my salvation shall remain forever   and my victory shall always be firm .    hear I , you who know justice ,   you people who have my teaching at heart : do not fear the reproach of other ;   remain firm at their reviling .   they shall be like a garment eat by moth ,   like wool consume by grub ; but my victory shall remain forever ,   my salvation , for all generation .      Awake , awake , put on strength ,   arm of the   Lord ! awake as in the day of old ,   in age long ago ! be it not you who crush Rahab ,    you who pierce the dragon ?    be it not you who dry up the sea ,   the water of the great deep ,   you who make the depth of the sea into a way   for the redeemed to pass through ?   those whom the   Lord   have ransom will return   and enter Zion singing ,   crown with everlasting joy ; they will meet with joy and gladness ,   sorrow and mourning will flee .     I , it be I who comfort you .   can you then fear mortal who die ,   human being who be just grass ,   and forget the   Lord , your maker ,   who stretch out the heaven   and lay the foundation of earth ? all the day you be in constant dread   of the fury of the oppressor when he prepare himself to destroy ;   but where be the oppressor fury ?     the captive shall soon be release ;   they shall not die and go down into the pit ,   nor shall they want for bread .   for I be the   Lord , your God ,   who stir up the sea so that its wave roar ;   the   Lord   of host by name .    I have put my word into your mouth ,   I cover you , shield by my hand , stretch out the heavens ,   lay the foundation of the earth ,   say to Zion : you be my people .    the Cup of the Lord   Wake up , wake up !   Arise , Jerusalem , you who drink at the   Lord s hand   the cup of his wrath ; who drain to the dreg   the bowl of staggering !    she have no one to guide she   of all the child she bear ; she have no one to take she by the hand ,   of all the child she reared!\xe2\x80\x94   your misfortune be double ;   who be there to grieve with you ? desolation and destruction , famine and sword !   who be there to comfort you ?   your child lie helpless   at every street corner   like antelope in a net . they be fill with the wrath of the   Lord ,   the rebuke of your God .     but now , hear this , afflict one ,   drunk , but not with wine ,    thus say the   Lord , your Master ,   your God , who defend his people : see , I be take from your hand   the cup of staggering ; the bowl of my wrath   you shall no long drink .   I will put it into the hand of your tormentor ,   those who say to you ,   Bow down , that we may walk over you . so you offer your back like the ground ,   like the street for they to walk on .
