b '   Defeat of Midian .     early the next morning Jerubbaal    ( that is , Gideon ) encamp by the spring of Harod with all his soldier . the camp of Midian be north of he , beside the hill of Moreh in the valley .      the   Lord   say to Gideon : you have too many soldier with you for I to deliver Midian into their power , lest Israel vaunt itself against I and say , my own power save I .         so announce in the hearing of the soldier , if anyone be afraid or fearful , let he leave !    let he depart from Mount Gilead !    twenty - two thousand of the soldier leave , but ten thousand remain .      the   Lord   say to Gideon : there be still too many soldier . lead they down to the water and I will test they for you there . if I tell you that a certain man be to go with you , he must go with you . but no one be to go if I tell you he must not .       when Gideon lead the soldier down to the water , the   Lord   say to he : everyone who lap up the water as a dog do with its tongue you shall set aside by himself ; and everyone who kneel down to drink raise his hand to his mouth you shall set aside by himself .      those who lap up the water with their tongue number three hundred , but all the rest of the soldier kneel down to drink the water .      the   Lord   say to Gideon : by mean of the three hundred who lap up the water I will save you and deliver Midian into your power . so let all the other soldier go home .      they take up such supply as the soldier have with they , as well as their horn , and Gideon send the rest of the Israelites to their tent , but keep the three hundred man . now the camp of Midian be below he in the valley .     that night the   Lord   say to Gideon : go , descend on the camp , for I have deliver it into your power .      if you be afraid to attack , go down to the camp with your aide Purah      and listen to what they be say . after that you will have the courage to descend on the camp . so he go down with his aide Purah to the outpost of the armed man in the camp .       the Midianites , Amalekites , and all the Kedemites be lie in the valley , thick as locust . their camel could not be count , for they be as many as the sand on the seashore .       when Gideon arrive , one man be tell another about a dream . I have a dream , he say , that a round loaf of barley bread be roll into the camp of Midian . it come to a certain tent and strike it and turn it upside down , and the tent collapse .      this can only be the sword of the Israelite Gideon , son of Joash , the other reply . God have deliver Midian and all the camp into his power .      when Gideon hear the account of the dream and its explanation , he bow down . then return to the camp of Israel , he say , Arise , for the   Lord   have deliver the camp of Midian into your power .     he divide the three hundred man into three company , and provide they all with horn and with empty jar and torch inside the jar .      watch I and follow my lead , he tell they . I shall go to the edge of the camp , and as I do , you must do also .      when I and those with I blow horn , you too must blow horn all around the camp and cry out , for the   Lord   and for Gideon !      so Gideon and the hundred man who be with he come to the edge of the camp at the beginning of the middle watch ,    just after the posting of the guard . they blow the horn and break the jar they be hold .      when the three company have blow their horn and break their jar , they take the torch in their left hand , and in their right the horn they have be blow , and cry out , a sword for the   Lord   and for Gideon !      they all remain stand in place around the camp , while the whole camp begin to run and shout and flee .      when they blow the three hundred horn , the   Lord   set the sword of one against another throughout the camp , and they flee as far as Beth - shittah in the direction of Zeredah , near the border of Abel - meholah at Tabbath .      the Israelites be call to arm from Naphtali , from Asher , and from all Manasseh , and they pursue Midian .      Gideon also send messenger throughout the mountain region of Ephraim to say , go down to intercept Midian , and seize the water course against they as far as Beth - barah , as well as the Jordan . so all the ephraimite be call to arm , and they seize the water course as far as Beth - barah , and the Jordan as well .       they capture the two prince of Midian , Oreb and Zeeb , kill Oreb at the rock of Oreb and Zeeb at the wine press of Zeeb . then they pursue Midian , but they have the head of Oreb and Zeeb bring to Gideon beyond the Jordan .
