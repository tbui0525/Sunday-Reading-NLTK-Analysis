Extol she , and she will exalt you ;   she will bring you honor if you embrace she ;   she will put on your head a graceful diadem ;   a glorious crown will she bestow on you .    the two Ways    Hear , my son , and receive my word ,   and the year of your life shall be many .    on the way of wisdom I direct you ,   I lead you on straight path .   when you walk , your step will not be impede ,   and should you run , you will not stumble .   hold fast to instruction , never let it go ;   keep it , for it be your life .    the path of the wicked do not enter ,   nor walk in the way of the evil ;   Shun it , do not cross it ,   turn aside from it , pass on .   for they can not rest unless they have do evil ;   if they do not trip anyone they lose sleep .   for they eat the bread of wickedness   and drink the wine of violence .   but the path of the just be like shine light ,   that grow in brilliance till perfect day .    the way of the wicked be like darkness ;   they do not know on what they stumble .    with your whole be Heed my word and live    my son , to my word be attentive ,   to my saying incline your ear ;   let they not slip from your sight ,   keep they within your heart ;   for they be life to those who find they ,    bring health to one whole being .   with all vigilance guard your heart ,   for in it be the source of life .    dishonest mouth put away from you ,   deceitful lip put far from you .   let your eye look straight ahead   and your gaze be focus forward .   survey the path for your foot ,   and all your way will be sure .   turn neither to right nor to left ,   keep your foot far from evil .
