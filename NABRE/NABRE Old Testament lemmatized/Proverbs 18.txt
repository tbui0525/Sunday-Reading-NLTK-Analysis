b '    one who be alienate seek a pretext ,   with all persistence pick a quarrel .   fool take no delight in understanding ,   but only in display what they think .    with wickedness come contempt ,   and with disgrace , scorn .   the word of one mouth be deep water ,   the spring of wisdom , a run brook .     it be not good to favor the guilty ,   nor to reject the claim of the just .    the lip of fool walk into a fight ,   and their mouth be ask for a beating .    the mouth of fool be their ruin ;   their lip be a deadly snare .    the word of a talebearer be like dainty morsel :   they sink into one inmost be .    those slack in their work   be kin to the destroyer .    the name of the   Lord   be a strong tower ;   the just run to it and be safe .   the wealth of the rich be their strong city ;    they fancy it a high wall .   before disaster the heart be haughty ,    but before honor be humility .   whoever answer before listen ,    theirs be folly and shame .    Ones spirit support one when ill ,   but a broken spirit who can bear ?    the heart of the intelligent acquire knowledge ,   and the ear of the wise seek knowledge .    gift clear the way for people ,   win access to the great .    those who plead the case first seem to be in the right ;   then the opponent come and cross - examine they .    the lot put an end to dispute ,   and decide a controversy between the mighty .    a brother offend be more unyielding than a stronghold ;   such strife be more daunting than castle gate .    with the fruit of one mouth one belly be fill ,   with the produce of one lip one be sate .     death and life be in the power of the tongue ;    those who choose one shall eat its fruit .    to find a wife be to find happiness ,   a favor grant by the   Lord .    the poor implore ,   but the rich answer harshly .   there be friend who bring ruin ,   but there be true friend more loyal than a brother .
