b '   Israels history of Infidelity .     in the seventh year , on the tenth day of the fifth month ,    some of the elder of Israel come to consult the   Lord   and sit down before I .        then the word of the   Lord   come to I :      Son of man , speak to the elder of Israel and say to they : thus say the Lord   God : have you come to consult I ? as I live , I will not allow myself to be consult by you!\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the Lord   God .     will you judge they ? will you judge , son of man ? tell they about the abomination of their ancestor ,        and say to they : thus say the Lord   God : the day I choose Israel , I swear to the descendant of the house of Jacob ; I reveal myself to they in the land of Egypt and swear to they , say : I be the   Lord , your God .      that day I swear to bring they out of the land of Egypt to the land I have search out for they , a land flow with milk and honey , a jewel among all land .        then I say to they : throw away , each of you , the detestable thing    that hold your eye ; do not defile yourself with the idol of Egypt : I be the   Lord , your God .      but they rebel and refuse to listen to I ; none of they throw away the detestable thing that hold their eye , nor do they abandon the idol of Egypt . then I consider pour out my fury and spend my anger against they there in the land of Egypt .        I act for the sake of my name , that it should not be desecrate in the eye of the nation among whom they be : in the eye of the nation I have make myself know to they , to bring they out of the land of Egypt .        therefore I lead they out of the land of Egypt and bring they into the wilderness .       then I give they my statute and make known to they my ordinance , so that everyone who keep they have life through they .       I also give they my sabbath to be a sign between I and they , to show that it be I , the   Lord , who make they holy .     but the house of Israel rebel against I in the wilderness . they do not observe my statute , and they reject my ordinance that bring life to those who keep they . my sabbath , too , they desecrate grievously . then I consider pour out my fury on they in the wilderness to put an end to they ,        but I act for the sake of my name , so it would not be desecrate in the eye of the nation in whose sight I have bring they out .        nevertheless in the wilderness I swear to they that I would not bring they into the land I have give them\xe2\x80\x94a land flow with milk and honey , a jewel among all the land .      their heart follow after their idol so closely that they do not live by my statute , but reject my ordinance and desecrate my sabbath .      but I look on they with pity , not want to destroy they , so I do not put an end to they in the wilderness .     then I say to their child in the wilderness : do not follow the statute of your parent . do not keep their ordinance . do not defile yourself with their idol .      I be the   Lord , your God : follow my statute and be careful to observe my ordinance ;      keep holy my sabbath as a sign between I and you so that you may know that I be the   Lord , your God .        but their child rebel against I : they do not follow my statute or keep my ordinance that bring life to those who observe they ; my sabbath they desecrate . then I consider pour out my fury on they , spend my anger against they in the wilderness ;      but I stay my hand , act for the sake of my name , lest it be desecrate in the eye of the nation , in whose sight I have bring they out .      nevertheless I swear to they in the wilderness that I would disperse they among the nation and scatter they in other land ,      because they do not carry out my ordinance , but reject my statute and desecrate my sabbath , have eye only for the idol of their ancestor .      therefore I give they statute that be not good ,    and ordinance through which they could not have life .        I let they become defile by their offering , by have they make a fiery offering of every womb firstborn , in order to ruin they so they might know that I be the   Lord .      therefore speak to the house of Israel , son of man , and tell they : thus say the Lord   God : in this way also your ancestor blaspheme I , break faith with I .      when I bring they to the land I have swear to give they , and they see all its high hill and leafy tree , there they offer sacrifice , there they make offering to provoke I , there they send up sweet - smell oblation , there they pour out their libation .        so I say to they , what be this high place    to which you go ? thus its name become high place even to this day .        therefore say to the house of Israel : thus say the Lord   God : will you defile yourself in the way your ancestor do ? will you lust after their detestable idol ?      by offer your gift , by make your child pass through the fire , you defile yourself with all your idol even to this day . shall I let myself be consult by you , house of Israel ? as I live\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the Lord   God \xe2\x80\x94i swear I will not let myself be consult by you !      what have enter your mind shall never happen : you be think , we shall be like the nation , like the people of foreign land , serve wood and stone .      as I live\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the Lord   God \xe2\x80\x94with mighty hand and outstretched arm , with wrath pour out , I swear I will be king over you !        with mighty hand and outstretched arm , with wrath pour out , I will bring you out from the nation and gather you from the country over which you be scatter ;         I will lead you to the wilderness of the people and enter into judgment with you face to face .      just as I enter into judgment with your ancestor in the wilderness of the land of Egypt , so will I enter into judgment with you\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the Lord   God .      thus I will make you pass under the staff    and will impose on you the term of the covenant .        I will sort out from you those who defy I and rebel against I ; from the land where they reside as alien I will bring they out , but they shall not return to the land of Israel . thus you shall know that I be the   Lord .     as for you , house of Israel , thus say the Lord   God : go ! each of you , and worship your idol . listen to I ! you shall never again desecrate my holy name with your offering and your idol !        for on my holy mountain ,    on the high mountain in Israel\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the Lord   God \xe2\x80\x94there the whole house of Israel shall worship I ; there in the land I will accept they all , there I will claim your tribute , the good of your offering , from all your holy thing .        as a sweet - smell oblation I will accept you , when I bring you from among the nation and gather you out of the land over which you be scatter ; and through you I will manifest my holiness in the sight of the nation .        thus you shall know that I be the   Lord , when I bring you back to the soil of Israel , the land I swear to give your ancestor .      there you shall remember your way , all the deed by which you defile yourself ; and you shall loathe yourself because of all the evil you do .        and you shall know that I be the   Lord   when I deal with you thus , for the sake of my name , not accord to your evil way and wanton deed , house of Israel\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the Lord   God .
