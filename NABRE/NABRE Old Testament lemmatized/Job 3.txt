b '    Jobs Complaint .     after this , Job open his mouth and curse his day .        Job speak out and say :     perish the day on which I be bear ,    the night when they say , the child be a boy !   may that day be darkness :   may God    above not care for it ,   may light not shine upon it !   May darkness and gloom claim it ,   cloud settle upon it ,   blackness of day    affright it !   May obscurity seize that night ;   may it not be count among the day of the year ,   nor enter into the number of the month !   may that night be barren ;   let no joyful outcry greet it !   let they curse it who curse the Sea ,   those skilled at disturb Leviathan !    may the star of its twilight be darken ;   may it look for daylight , but have none ,   nor gaze on the eye of the dawn ,   because it do not keep shut the door of the womb   to shield my eye from trouble !   why do I not die at birth ,    come forth from the womb and expire ?   why do knee receive I ,   or breast nurse I ?   for then I should have lain down and be tranquil ;   have I sleep , I should then have be at rest   with king and counselor of the earth   who rebuild what be ruin   or with prince who have gold   and fill their house with silver .   or why be I not bury away like a stillborn child ,   like baby that have never see the light ?   there    the wicked cease from troubling ,   there the weary be at rest .   the captive be at ease together ,   and hear no overseer voice .   small and great be there ;   the servant be free from the master .   why be light give to the toiler ,   life to the bitter in spirit ?   they wait for death and it do not come ;   they search for it more than for hidden treasure .   they rejoice in it exultingly ,   and be glad when they find the grave :   a man whose path be hide from he ,   one whom God have hem in !    for to I sigh come more readily than food ;   my groan well forth like water .   for what I fear overtake I ;   what I dread come upon I .   I have no peace nor ease ;   I have no rest , for trouble have come !             '
