b '   law concern Nazirites .     the   Lord   say to Moses :      speak to the Israelites and tell they : when man or woman solemnly take the nazirite    vow to dedicate themselves to the   Lord ,      they shall abstain from wine and strong drink ;    they may neither drink wine vinegar , other vinegar , or any kind of grape juice , nor eat either fresh or dry grape .      as long as they be nazirite they shall not eat anything of the produce of the grapevine ; not even the seed or the skin .      while they be under the nazirite vow , no razor shall touch their hair .    until the period of their dedication to the   Lord   be over , they shall be holy , let the hair of their head grow freely .      as long as they be dedicate to the   Lord , they shall not come near a dead person .        not even for their father or mother , sister or brother , should they defile themselves , when these die , since their head bear their dedication to God .      as long as they be nazirite they be holy to the   Lord .     if someone die very suddenly in their presence , defile their dedicated head , they shall shave their head on the day of their purification , that is , on the seventh day .      on the eighth day they shall bring two turtledove or two pigeon to the priest at the entrance of the tent of meeting .      the priest shall offer up the one as a purification offering and the other as a burn offering , thus make atonement for they for the sin they commit with respect to the corpse . on the same day they shall reconsecrate their head      and rededicate themselves to the   Lord   for the period of their dedication , bring a yearling lamb as a reparation offering . the previous period be not valid , because they defile their dedicate head .     this be the ritual for the nazirites :    when the period of their dedication be complete they shall go to the entrance of the tent of meeting ,      bring their offering to the   Lord , one unblemished yearle lamb for a burn offering , one unblemished yearle ewe lamb for a purification offering , one unblemished ram as a communion offering ,      and a basket of unleavened cake of bran flour mix with oil and of unleavened wafer spread with oil , along with their grain offering and libation .      the priest shall present they before the   Lord , and shall offer up the purification offering and the burn offering for they .      he shall then offer up the ram as a communion sacrifice to the   Lord , along with the basket of unleavened cake , and the priest will offer the grain offering and libation .      then at the entrance of the tent of meet the nazirite shall shave his or her dedicated head , take the hair of the dedicated head , and put it in the fire under the communion sacrifice .      after the nazirite have shave off the dedicated hair , the priest shall take a boil shoulder of the ram , as well as one unleavene cake from the basket and one unleavene wafer , and shall put they in the hand of the nazirite .      the priest shall then elevate they as an elevated offering before the   Lord . they be an offering belong to the priest , along with the brisket of the elevated offering and the leg of the contribution . only after this may the nazirite drink wine .     this , then , be the law for the nazirite , that is , what they vow as their offering to the   Lord   in accord with their dedication , apart from anything else which their mean may allow . in keep with the vow they take so shall they do , accord to the law of their dedication .    the priestly Blessing .     the   Lord   say to Moses :      speak to Aaron and his son and tell they : this be how you shall bless the Israelites . say to they :     the   Lord   bless you and keep you !   the   Lord   let his face shine upon you , and be gracious to you !   the   Lord   look upon you kindly and give you peace !      so shall they invoke my name upon the Israelites , and I will bless they .
