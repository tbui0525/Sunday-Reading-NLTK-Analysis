b '   the New Zion   raise a glad cry , you barren one    who never bear a child ,   break forth in jubilant song , you who have never be in labor , for more numerous be the child of the deserted wife   than the child of she who have a husband ,   say the   Lord .    enlarge the space for your tent ,   spread out your tent cloth unsparingly ;   lengthen your rope and make firm your peg .    for you shall spread abroad to the right and leave ;   your descendant shall dispossess the nation   and shall people the deserted city .       do not fear , you shall not be put to shame ;   do not be discourage , you shall not be disgrace . for the shame of your youth you shall forget ,   the reproach of your widowhood no long remember .   for your husband be your maker ;   the   Lord   of host be his name , your redeemer ,    the Holy One of Israel ,   call God of all the earth .     the   Lord   call you back ,   like a wife forsake and grieve in spirit , a wife marry in youth and then cast off ,   say your God .    for a brief moment I abandon you ,   but with great tenderness I will take you back .   in an outburst of wrath , for a moment   I hide my face from you ; but with endure love I take pity on you ,   say the   Lord , your redeemer .     this be for I like the day of Noah : as I swear then that the water of Noah   should never again flood the earth , so I have swear now not to be angry with you ,   or to rebuke you .    though the mountain fall away   and the hill be shake , my love shall never fall away from you   nor my covenant of peace    be shake ,   say the   Lord , who have mercy on you .      o afflict one ,    storm - batter and unconsoled ,   I lay your pavement in carnelians ,   your foundation in sapphire ;    I will make your battlement of ruby ,   your gate of jewel ,   and all your wall of precious stone .   all your child shall be teach by the   Lord ;   great shall be the peace of your child .   in justice shall you be establish ,   far from oppression , you shall not fear ,   from destruction , it can not come near .   if there be an attack , it be not my doing ;   whoever attack shall fall before you .     see , I have create the smith   who blow on the burn coal   and forge weapon as his work ; it be I also who have create   the destroyer to work havoc .   every weapon fashion against you shall fail ;   every tongue that bring you to trial   you shall prove false .    this be the lot of the servant of the   Lord ,   their vindication from me\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord .
