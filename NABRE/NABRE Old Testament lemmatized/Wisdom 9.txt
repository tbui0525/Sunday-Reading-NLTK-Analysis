b '   Solomons Prayer     God of my ancestor , Lord of mercy ,    you who have make all thing by your word    and in your wisdom have establish humankind   to rule the creature produce by you ,    and to govern the world in holiness and righteousness ,   and to render judgment in integrity of heart :    give I wisdom , the consort at your throne ,   and do not reject I from among your child ;    for I be your servant , the child of your maidservant ,   a man weak and short - live   and lack in comprehension of judgment and of law .    indeed , though one be perfect among mortal ,   if Wisdom , who come from you , be lack ,   that one will count for nothing .      you have choose I king over your people   and magistrate over your son and daughter .    you have bid I build a temple on your holy mountain   and an altar in the city that be your dwelling place ,   a copy of the holy tabernacle which you have establish from of old .    now with you be wisdom , who know your work   and be present when you make the world ; who understand what be pleasing in your eye   and what be conformable with your command .    send she forth from your holy heaven   and from your glorious throne dispatch she that she may be with I and work with I ,   that I may know what be pleasing to you .    for she know and understand all thing ,   and will guide I prudently in my affair   and safeguard I by her glory ;    thus my deed will be acceptable ,   and I will judge your people justly   and be worthy of my father throne .      for who know Gods counsel ,   or who can conceive what the Lord intend ?    for the deliberation of mortal be timid ,   and uncertain our plan .    for the corruptible body burden the soul   and the earthly tent weigh down the mind with its many concern .    scarcely can we guess the thing on earth ,   and only with difficulty grasp what be at hand ;   but thing in heaven , who can search they out ?    or who can know your counsel , unless you give wisdom   and send your holy spirit from on high ?     thus be the path of those on earth make straight ,   and people learn what please you ,   and be save by Wisdom .
