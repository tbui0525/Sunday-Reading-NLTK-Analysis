b '   praise for Gods Deliverance and the Celebration in Zion    O   Lord , you be my God ,   I extol you , I praise your name ; for you have carry out your wonderful plan of old ,   faithful and true .    for you have make the city a heap ,   the fortified city a ruin , the castle of the insolent , a city no more ,   not ever to be rebuild .    therefore a strong people will honor you ,   ruthless nation will fear you .   for you have be a refuge to the poor ,   a refuge to the needy in their distress ; shelter from the rain ,   shade from the heat .   when the blast of the ruthless be like a winter rain ,    the roar of stranger like heat in the desert , you subdue the heat with the shade of a cloud ,   the rain of the tyrant be vanquish .   on this mountain    the   Lord   of host   will provide for all people a feast of rich food and choice wine ,   juicy , rich food and pure , choice wine .   on this mountain he will destroy   the veil that veil all people , the web that be weave over all nation .    he will destroy death forever . the Lord   God   will wipe away   the tear from all face ; the reproach of his people he will remove   from the whole earth ; for the   Lord   have speak .     on that day it will be say : indeed , this be our God ; we look to he , and he save we !   this be the   Lord   to whom we look ;   let we rejoice and be glad that he have save we !     judgment on Moab    for the hand of the   Lord   will rest on this mountain ,   but Moab will be trodden down   as straw be trodden down in the mire .    he will spread out his hand in its midst ,   as a swimmer spread out his hand to swim ; his pride will be bring low   despite his stroke .    the high - walled fortress he will raze ,   bring it low , level it to the ground , to the very dust .
