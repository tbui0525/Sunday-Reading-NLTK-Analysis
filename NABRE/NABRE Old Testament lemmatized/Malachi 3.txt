b '   the Messenger of the Covenant    now I be send my messenger\xe2\x80\x94   he will prepare the way before I ;   and the lord whom you seek will come suddenly to his temple ; the messenger of the covenant whom you desire\xe2\x80\x94   see , he be come ! say the   Lord   of host .   but who can endure the day of his come ?   who can stand firm when he appear ? for he will be like a refiner fire ,   like fuller lye .    he will sit refining and purify silver ,   and he will purify the Levites , refine they like gold or silver ,   that they may bring offering to the   Lord   in righteousness .   then the offering of Judah and Jerusalem   will please the   Lord ,   as in ancient day , as in year go by .   I will draw near to you for judgment ,   and I will be swift to bear witness against sorcerer , adulterer , and perjurer ,   those who deprive a laborer of wage , Oppress a widow or an orphan ,   or turn aside a resident alien ,   without fear I , say the   Lord   of host .    gift for God , blessing for the People   for I , the   Lord , do not change ,    and you , son of Jacob , do not cease to be .    since the day of your ancestor you have turn aside   from my statute and have not keep they . return to I , that I may return to you ,   say the   Lord   of host . but you say , why should we return ?     can anyone rob God ? but you be rob I ! and you say , how have we rob you ?   of tithe and contribution !   you be indeed accursed ,   for you , the whole nation , rob I .    bring the whole tithe   into the storehouse ,   that there may be food in my house .   Put I to the test , say the   Lord   of host , and see if I do not open the floodgate of heaven for you ,   and pour down upon you blessing without measure !   I will rebuke the locust for you   so that it will not destroy your crop , and the vine in the field will not be barren ,   say the   Lord   of host .    all the nation will call you bless ,   for you will be a delightful land ,   say the   Lord   of host .    the need to serve God   your word be too much for I , say the   Lord .   you ask , what have we speak against you ?    you have say , it be useless to serve God ;   what do we gain by observe god requirement , and by go about as mourner    before the   Lord   of host ?   but we call the arrogant bless ;   for evildoer not only prosper   but even test God and escape .    then those who fear the   Lord   speak with one another ,   and the   Lord   listen attentively ; a record book    be write before he   of those who fear the   Lord   and esteem his name .    they shall be mine , say the   Lord   of host ,   my own special possession , on the day when I take action . and I will have compassion on they ,   as a man have compassion on his son who serve he .   then you will again distinguish   between the just and the wicked , between the person who serve God ,   and the one who do not .    for the day be come , blaze like an oven ,   when all the arrogant and all evildoer will be stubble , and the day that be come will set they on fire ,   leave they neither root nor branch ,   say the   Lord   of host .    but for you who fear my name , the sun of justice   will arise with healing in its wing ;   and you will go out leap like calf from the stall    and tread down the wicked ; they will become dust under the sol of your foot ,   on the day when I take action , say the   Lord   of host .    Moses and Elijah    remember the law of Moses my servant ,   whom I charge at Horeb with statute and ordinance   for all Israel .    now I be send to you   Elijah    the prophet , before the day of the   Lord   come ,   the great and terrible day ;   he will turn the heart of father to their son ,   and the heart of son to their father , Lest I come and strike   the land with utter destruction .
