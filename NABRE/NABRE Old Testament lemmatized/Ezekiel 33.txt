b '    the Prophet as Sentinel .     the word of the   Lord   come to I :      Son of man , speak to your people and tell they : when I bring the sword against a land , if the people of that land select one of their number as a sentinel    for they ,        and the sentinel see the sword come against the land , he should blow the trumpet to warn the people .        if they hear the trumpet but do not take the warning and a sword attack and kill they , their blood will be on their own head .        they hear the trumpet blast but ignore the warning ; their blood be on they . if they have heed the warning , they could have escape with their life .      if , however , the sentinel see the sword come and do not blow the trumpet , so that the sword attack and take someone life , his life will be take for his own sin , but I will hold the sentinel responsible for his blood .      you , son of man\xe2\x80\x94i have appoint you as a sentinel for the house of Israel ; when you hear a word from my mouth , you must warn they for I .      when I say to the wicked , you wicke , you must die , and you do not speak up to warn the wicked about their way , they shall die in their sin , but I will hold you responsible for their blood .      if , however , you warn the wicked to turn from their way , but they do not , then they shall die in their sin , but you shall save your life .    Individual Retribution .     as for you , son of man , speak to the house of Israel : you people say , our crime and our sin weigh we down ; we be rot away because of they . how can we survive ?         answer they : as I live\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the Lord   God \xe2\x80\x94i swear I take no pleasure in the death of the wicked , but rather that they turn from their way and live . turn , turn from your evil way ! why should you die , house of Israel ?     as for you , son of man , say to your people : the justice of the just will not save they on the day they sin ; the wickedness of the wicked will not bring about their downfall on the day they turn from their wickedness . no , the just can not save their life on the day they sin .        even though I say to the just that they shall surely live , if they , rely on their justice , do wrong , none of their just deed shall be remember ; because of the wrong they have do , they shall die .        and though I say to the wicked that they shall die , if they turn away from sin and do what be just and right\xe2\x80\x94      return pledge , restore steal good , walk by statute that bring life , do nothing wrong\xe2\x80\x94they shall surely live ; they shall not die .        none of the sin they commit shall be remember against they . if they do what be right and just , they shall surely live .     your people say , the way of the   Lord   be not fair ! but it be their way that be not fair .      when the just turn away from justice and do wrong , they shall die for it .        when the wicked turn away from wickedness and do what be right and just , because of this they shall live .      but still you say , the way of the   Lord   be not fair ! I will judge each of you accord to your way , house of Israel .    the Survivor from Jerusalem .     on the fifth day of the tenth month ,    in the twelfth year of our exile , the survivor come to I from Jerusalem and say , the city be take !        the hand of the   Lord   have come upon I the evening before the survivor arrive and open my mouth when he reach I in the morning . my mouth be open , and I be mute no long .   those leave in Judah .        the word of the   Lord   come to I :      Son of man , these who live among the ruin in the land of Israel be say : Abraham be only one person , yet he be give possession of the land . since we be many , the land must be give to we as our possession .        therefore say to they : thus say the Lord   God : you eat on the mountain , you raise your eye to your idol , you shed blood\xe2\x80\x94yet you would keep possession of the land ?        you rely on your sword , you commit abomination , each defile his neighbor wife\xe2\x80\x94yet you would keep possession of the land ?      say this to they : thus say the Lord   God : as I live , those among the ruin shall fall by the sword ; those in the open field I have make food for the wild beast ; and those in rocky hideout and cave shall die by the plague .      I will make the land a desolate waste , so that its proud strength will come to an end , and the mountain of Israel shall be so desolate that no one will cross they .      thus they shall know that I be the   Lord , when I make the land a desolate waste because of all the abomination they commit .    Popular Misunderstanding .     as for you , son of man , your people be talk about you beside the wall and in the doorway of house . they say to one another , Lets go hear the late word that come from the   Lord .      my people come to you , gather as a crowd and sit in front of you to hear your word , but they will not act on they . love song be on their lip , but in their heart they pursue dishonest gain .        for they you be only a singer    of love song , with a pleasant voice and a clever touch . they listen to your word , but they do not obey they .      but when it comes\xe2\x80\x94and it be surely coming!\xe2\x80\x94they shall know that there be a prophet among they .
