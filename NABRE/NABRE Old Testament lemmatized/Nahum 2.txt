b '    at this moment on the mountain   the footstep of one bear good news ,   of one announce peace !   celebrate your feast , Judah ,   fulfill your vow ! for never again will destroyer invade you ;    they be completely cut off .    the attack on Nineveh   one who scatter have come up against you ;    guard the rampart , watch the road , brace yourself ,   marshal all your strength !    the   Lord   will restore the vine of Jacob ,   the honor of Israel , because ravager have ravage they   and ruin their branch .   the shield of his warrior be crimson ,   the soldier clothe in scarlet ; like fire be the trapping of the chariot   on the day he prepare for war ;   the cavalry be agitate !   the chariot dash madly through the street   and wheel in the square , look like torch ,   bolt like lightning .   his pick troop be call ,   rank break at their charge ; to the wall they rush ,   their screen    be set up .   the river gate    be open ,   the palace be wash away .   the mistress be lead forth captive ,   and her maidservant    lead away , moan like dove ,   beat their breast .   Nineveh be like a pool   whose water escape ; stop ! stop !   but none turn back .    plunder the silver , plunder the gold !   there be no end to the treasure ,   to wealth in every precious thing !     Emptiness , desolation , waste ;   melt heart and tremble knee , churn in every stomach ,   every face turn pale !    where be the lioness den ,   the young lion cave , where the lion    go in and out ,   and the cub , with no one to disturb they ?    the lion tear apart enough for his cub ,   and strangle for his lioness ; he fill his lair with prey ,   and his dens with torn flesh .   I now come against you\xe2\x80\x94   oracle of the   Lord   of hosts\xe2\x80\x94 I will consume your chariot in smoke ,   and the sword will devour your young lion ; your preying on the land I will bring to an end ,   the cry of your lioness will be hear no more .
