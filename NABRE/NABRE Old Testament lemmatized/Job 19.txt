b '   Jobs Fifth Reply .      then Job answer and say :     how long will you afflict my spirit ,   grind I down with word ?   these ten time you have humiliate I ,   have assail I without shame !   even if it be true that I be at fault ,   my fault would remain with I ;   if truly you exalt yourself at my expense ,   and use my shame as an argument against I ,   know then that it be God who have deal unfairly with I ,   and compass I round with his net .   if I cry out violence ! I be not answer .    I shout for help , but there be no justice .   he have bar my way and I can not pass ;   veil my path in darkness ;   he have strip I of my glory ,   take the diadem from my brow .   he break I down on every side , and I be go ;   he have uproot my hope like a tree .   he have kindle his wrath against I ;   he count I one of his enemy .    his troop advance as one ;   they build up their road to attack I ,   encamp around my tent .   my family have withdraw from I ,    my friend be wholly estranged .   my relative and companion neglect I ,   my guest have forget I .   even my maidservant consider I a stranger ;   I be a foreigner in their sight .   I call my servant , but he give no answer ,   though I plead aloud with he .   my breath be abhorrent to my wife ;    I be loathsome to my very child .   even young child despise I ;   when I appear , they speak against I .   all my intimate friend hold I in horror ;   those whom I love have turn against I !    my bone cling to my skin ,   and I have escape by the skin of my tooth .    pity I , pity I , you my friend ,   for the hand of God have strike I !   why do you pursue I like God ,   and prey insatiably upon I ?   oh , would that my word be write down !    would that they be inscribe in a record :    that with an iron chisel and with lead   they be cut in the rock forever !   as for I , I know that my vindicator live ,    and that he will at last stand forth upon the dust .    this will happen when my skin have be strip off ,   and from my flesh I will see God :   I will see for myself ,   my own eye , not another , will behold he :   my inmost be be consume with longing .   but you who say , how shall we persecute he ,   see that the root of the matter be find in he ?   be afraid of the sword for yourself ,   for your anger be a crime deserve the sword ;   that you may know that there be a judgment .
