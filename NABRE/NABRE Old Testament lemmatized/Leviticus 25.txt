b '   the Sabbatical Year .     the   Lord   say to Moses on Mount Sinai :       speak to the Israelites and tell they : when you enter the land that I be give you , let the land , too , keep a sabbath for the   Lord .      for six year you may sow your field , and for six year prune your vineyard , gather in their produce .        but during the seventh year the land shall have a sabbath of complete rest , a sabbath for the   Lord ,    when you may neither sow your field nor prune your vineyard .      the aftergrowth of your harvest you shall not reap , nor shall you pick the grape of your untrimmed vine . it shall be a year of rest for the land .      while the land have its sabbath , all its produce will be food to eat for you yourself and for your male and female slave , for your laborer and the tenant who live with you ,      and likewise for your livestock and for the wild animal on your land .    the Jubilee Year .      you shall count seven week of years\xe2\x80\x94seven time seven years\xe2\x80\x94such that the seven week of year amount to forty - nine year .      then , on the tenth day of the seventh month    let the ram horn resound ; on this , the Day of Atonement ,    the ram horn blast shall resound throughout your land .      you shall treat this fiftieth year as sacred . you shall proclaim liberty in the land for all its inhabitant .    it shall be a jubilee for you , when each of you shall return to your own property , each of you to your own family .      this fiftieth year be your year of jubilee ; you shall not sow , nor shall you reap the aftergrowth or pick the untrimmed vine ,      since this be the jubilee . it shall be sacred for you . you may only eat what the field yield of itself .     in this year of jubilee , then , each of you shall return to your own property .      therefore , when you sell any land to your neighbor or buy any from your neighbor , do not deal unfairly with one another .      on the basis of the number of year since the last jubilee you shall purchase the land from your neighbor ;    and so also , on the basis of the number of year of harvest , that person shall sell it to you .      when the year be many , the price shall be so much the more ; when the year be few , the price shall be so much the less . for it be really the number of harvest that the person sell you .      do not deal unfairly with one another , then ; but stand in fear of your God . I , the   Lord , be your God .     observe my statute and be careful to keep my ordinance , so that you will dwell securely in the land .      the land will yield its fruit and you will eat your fill , and live there securely .        and if you say , what shall we eat in the seventh year , if we do not sow or reap our crop ?        I will command such a blessing for you in the sixth year that there will be crop enough for three year ,      and when you sow in the eighth year , you will still be eat from the old crop ; even into the ninth year , until the crop come in , you will still be eat from the old crop .   Redemption of Property .        the land shall not be sell irrevocably ; for the land be mine , and you be but resident alien and under my authority .      therefore , in every part of the country that you occupy , you must permit the land to be redeem .      when one of your kindred be reduce to poverty and have to sell some property , that person close relative ,    who have the duty to redeem it , shall come and redeem what the relative have sell .        if , however , the person have no relative to redeem it , but later on acquire sufficient mean to redeem it ,      the person shall calculate the year since the sale , return the balance to the one to whom it be sell , and thus regain the property .        but if the person do not acquire sufficient mean to buy back the land , what be sell shall remain in the possession of the purchaser until the year of the jubilee , when it must be release and return to the original owner .       when someone sell a dwelling in a walled town , it can be redeem up to a full year after its sale\xe2\x80\x94the redemption period be one year .      but if such a house in a walled town have not be redeem at the end of a full year , it shall belong irrevocably to the purchaser throughout the generation ; it shall not be release in the jubilee .      however , house in village that be not encircle by wall shall be reckon as part of the surround farm land ; they may be redeem , and in the jubilee they must be release .      in levitical city    the Levites shall always have the right to redeem the house in the city that be in their possession .      as for levitical property that go unredeemed\xe2\x80\x94houses sell in city of their possession shall be release in the jubilee ; for the house in levitical city be their possession in the midst of the Israelites .      moreover , the pasture land    belong to their city shall not be sell at all ; it must always remain their possession .     when one of your kindred be reduce to poverty and become indebted to you , you shall support that person like a resident alien ; let your kindred live with you .      do not exact interest in advance or accrue interest ,    but out of fear of God let your kindred live with you .       do not give your money at interest or your food at a profit .      I , the   Lord , be your God , who bring you out of the land of Egypt to give you the land of Canaan and to be your God .      when your kindred with you , having be so reduce to poverty , sell themselves to you , do not make they work as slave .        rather , let they be like laborer or like your tenant , work with you until the jubilee year ,      when , together with any child , they shall be release from your service and return to their family and to their ancestral property .      since they be my servant , whom I bring out of the land of Egypt , they shall not sell themselves as slave be sell .      do not lord it over they harshly , but stand in fear of your God .      the male and female slave that you possess\xe2\x80\x94these you shall acquire from the nation round about you .        you may also acquire they from among the resident alien who reside with you , and from their family who be with you , those whom they bear in your land . these you may possess ,      and bequeath to your child as their hereditary possession forever . you may treat they as slave . but none of you shall lord it harshly over any of your fellow Israelites .      when your kindred , having be so reduce to poverty , sell themselves to a resident alien who have become wealthy or to descendant of a resident alien family ,      even after having sell themselves , they still may be redeem by one of their kindred ,      by an uncle or cousin , or by some other relative from their family ; or , having acquire the mean , they may pay the redemption price themselves .      with the purchaser they shall compute the year from the sale to the jubilee , distribute the sale price over these year as though they have be hire as laborer .      the more year there be , the more of the sale price they shall pay back as the redemption price ;      the few year there be before the jubilee year , the more they have as credit ; in proportion to the year of service they shall pay the redemption price .      the tenant alien shall treat those who sell themselves as laborer hire on an annual basis , and the alien shall not lord it over they harshly before your very eye .      and if they be not redeem by these mean , they shall nevertheless be release , together with any child , in the jubilee year .      for the Israelites belong to I as servant ; they be my servant , whom I bring out of the land of Egypt , I , the   Lord , your God .
