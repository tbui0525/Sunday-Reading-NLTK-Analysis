b ' treacherous conspirator punish by God   for the leader . a psalm of David .    I   o God , hear my anguished voice ;   from a dreadful foe protect my life .   hide I from the malicious crowd ,   the mob of evildoer .   they sharpen their tongue like sword ,   bend their bow of poison word .    they shoot at the innocent from ambush ,   they shoot he in a moment and do not fear .   they resolve on their wicked plan ;   they conspire to set snare ;   they say : who will see we ?   they devise wicked scheme ,   conceal the scheme they devise ;   the design of their heart be hide .     II   God shoot an arrow at they ;   in a moment they be strike down .    they be bring down by their own tongue ;   all who see they flee .    every person fear and proclaim Gods action ,   they ponder his deed .   the righteous rejoice and take refuge in the   Lord ;   all the upright give praise .
