b '   the Fiery Furnace .     King Nebuchadnezzar have a golden statue make , sixty cubit high and six cubit wide , which he set up in the plain of Dura    in the province of Babylon .      he then order the satrap ,    prefect , and governor , the counselor , treasurer , judge , magistrate and all the official of the province to be summon to the dedication of the statue which he have set up .      the satrap , prefect , and governor , the counselor , treasurer , judge , magistrate and all the official of the province come together for the dedication and stand before the statue which King Nebuchadnezzar have set up .      a herald cry out : nation and people of every language ,       when you hear the sound of the horn , pipe , zither , dulcimer , harp , double - flute , and all the other musical instrument , you must fall down and worship the golden statue which King Nebuchadnezzar have set up .      whoever do not fall down and worship shall be instantly cast into a white - hot furnace .      therefore , as soon as they hear the sound of the horn , pipe , zither , dulcimer , harp , double - flute , and all the other musical instrument , the nation and people of every language all fall down and worship the golden statue which King Nebuchadnezzar have set up .     at that point , some of the Chaldeans come and accuse the Jews      to King Nebuchadnezzar : o king , live forever !      o king , you issue a decree that everyone who hear the sound of the horn , pipe , zither , dulcimer , harp , and double - flute , and all the other musical instrument should fall down and worship the golden statue ;      whoever do not be to be cast into a white - hot furnace .      there be certain Jews whom you have make administrator of the province of Babylon : Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego ; these man , o king , have pay no attention to you ; they will not serve your god or worship the golden statue which you set up .     Nebuchadnezzar fly into a rage and send for Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego , who be promptly bring before the king .      King Nebuchadnezzar question they : be it true , Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego , that you will not serve my god , or worship the golden statue that I set up ?      now , if you be ready to fall down and worship the statue I make , whenever you hear the sound of the horn , pipe , zither , dulcimer , harp , double - flute , and all the other musical instrument , then all will be well ;    if not , you shall be instantly cast into the white - hot furnace ; and who be the God who can deliver you out of my hand ?      Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego answer King Nebuchadnezzar , there be no need for we to defend ourselves before you in this matter .      if our God , whom we serve , can save we    from the white - hot furnace and from your hand , o king , may he save we !      but even if he will not , you should know , o king , that we will not serve your god or worship the golden statue which you set up .     Nebuchadnezzars face become livid with utter rage against Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego . he order the furnace to be heat seven time more than usual      and have some of the strong man in his army bind Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego and cast they into the white - hot furnace .      they be bind and cast into the white - hot furnace with their trouser , shirt , hat and other garment ,      for the king order be urgent . so huge a fire be kindle in the furnace that the flame devour the man who throw Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego into it .      but these three fall , bind , into the midst of the white - hot furnace . prayer of Azariah .        they walk about in the flame , singe to God and bless the Lord .      Azariah    stand up in the midst of the fire and pray aloud :     bless be you , and praiseworthy ,   o Lord , the God of our ancestor ,   and glorious forever be your name .   for you be just in all you have do ;   all your deed be faultless , all your way right ,   and all your judgment proper .   you have execute proper judgment   in all that you have bring upon we   and upon Jerusalem , the holy city of our ancestor . by a proper judgment you have do all this   because of our sin ;   for we have sin and transgress   by depart from you ,   and we have do every kind of evil .   your commandment we have not heed or observe ,   nor have we do as you order we for our good .   therefore all you have bring upon we ,   all you have do to we ,   you have do by a proper judgment .   you have hand we over to our enemy ,   lawless and hateful rebel ;   to an unjust king , the bad in all the world .   now we can not open our mouth ;   shame and reproach have come upon we ,   your servant , who revere you .   for your name sake , do not deliver we up forever ,   or make void your covenant .   do not take away your mercy from we ,   for the sake of Abraham , your beloved ,   Isaac your servant , and Israel your holy one ,   to whom you promise to multiply their offspring   like the star of heaven ,   or the sand on the shore of the sea .   for we be reduce , o Lord , beyond any other nation ,   bring low everywhere in the world this day   because of our sin .   we have in our day no prince , prophet , or leader ,   no burn offering , sacrifice , oblation , or incense ,   no place to offer first fruit , to find favor with you .   but with contrite heart and humble spirit   let we be receive ; as though it be burn offering of ram and bull ,   or ten of thousand of fat lamb ,   so let our sacrifice be in your presence today   and find favor before you ;   for those who trust in you can not be put to shame .   and now we follow you with our whole heart ,   we fear you and we seek your face . do not put we to shame ,    but deal with we in your kindness and great mercy .   deliver we in accord with your wonder ,   and bring glory to your name , o Lord :   let all those be put to shame   who inflict evil on your servant ; let they be shame and powerless ,   and their strength break ;   let they know that you alone be the Lord God ,   glorious over the whole world .     now the king servant who have throw they in continue to stoke the furnace with naphtha , pitch , tow , and brush .      the flame rise forty - nine cubit above the furnace ,      and spread out , burn the Chaldeans that it catch around the furnace .      but the angel of the Lord go down into the furnace with Azariah and his companion , drive the fiery flame out of the furnace ,      and make the inside of the furnace as though a dew - laden breeze be blow through it . the fire in no way touch they or cause they pain or harm .      then these three in the furnace with one voice sing , glorify and bless God :     bless be you , o Lord , the God of our ancestor ,   praiseworthy and exalted above all forever ; and bless be your holy and glorious name ,   praiseworthy and exalted above all for all age .   bless be you in the temple of your holy glory ,   praiseworthy and glorious above all forever .   bless be you on the throne of your kingdom ,   praiseworthy and exalted above all forever .   bless be you who look into the depth   from your throne upon the cherubim ,   praiseworthy and exalted above all forever .   bless be you in the firmament of heaven ,   praiseworthy and glorious forever .   bless the Lord , all you work of the Lord ,   praise and exalt he above all forever .

Nebuchadnezzar exclaim , bless be the God of Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego , who send his angel to deliver the servant that trust in he ; they disobey the royal command and yield their body rather than serve or worship any god except their own God .      therefore I decree for nation and people of every language that whoever blaspheme the God of Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego shall be cut to piece and his house make into a refuse heap . for there be no other God who can rescue like this .      then the king promote Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego in the province of Babylon .      King Nebuchadnezzar to the nation and people of every language , wherever they dwell on earth : may your peace abound !      it have seem good to I to publish the sign and wonder which the most high God have accomplish in my regard .     how great be his sign , how mighty his wonder ;   his kingship be an everlasting kingship ,   and his dominion endure through all generation .
