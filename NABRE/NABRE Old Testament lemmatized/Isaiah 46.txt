b '   the Gods of Babylon   Bel bow down , Nebo    stoop ,   their idol set upon beast and cattle ; they must be bear upon shoulder ,   a load for weary animal .   they stoop and bow down together ;   unable to deliver those who bear they ,   they too go into captivity .     hear I , o house of Jacob ,   all the remnant of the house of Israel , my burden from the womb ,   whom I have carry since birth .    even to your old age I be he ,   even when your hair be gray I will carry you ; I have do this , and I will lift you up ,   I will carry you to safety .     to whom would you liken I as an equal ,   compare I , as though we be alike ?   there be those who pour out gold from a purse   and weigh out silver on the scale ; they hire a goldsmith to make it into a god   before which they bow down in worship .   they lift it to their shoulder to carry ;   when they set it down , it stay ,   and do not move from the place . they cry out to it , but it can not answer ;   it deliver no one from distress .     remember this and be firm ,   take it to heart , you rebel ;    remember the former thing , those long ago : I be God , there be no other ;   I be God , there be none like I .   at the beginning I declare the outcome ;   from of old , thing not yet do . I say that my plan shall stand ,   I accomplish my every desire .     I summon from the east a bird of prey ,    from a distant land , one to carry out my plan . yes , I have speak , I will accomplish it ;   I have plan it , and I will do it .   listen to I , you fainthearte ,   far from the victory of justice :   I be bring on that victory , it be not far off ,   my salvation shall not tarry ; I will put salvation within Zion ,   give to Israel my glory .
