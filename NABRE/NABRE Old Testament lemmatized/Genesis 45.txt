b '   the truth reveal .      Joseph could no long restrain himself in the presence of all his attendant , so he cry out , have everyone withdraw from I ! so no one attend he when he make himself know to his brother .      but his sob be so loud that the Egyptians hear he , and so the news reach Pharaohs house .       I be Joseph , he say to his brother . be my father still alive ? but his brother could give he no answer , so dumbfounded be they at he .     come close to I , Joseph tell his brother . when they have do so , he say : I be your brother Joseph , whom you sell into Egypt .      but now do not be distressed , and do not be angry with yourself for having sell I here . it be really for the sake of save life that God send I here ahead of you .        the famine have be in the land for two year now , and for five more year cultivation will yield no harvest .      God , therefore , send I on ahead of you to ensure for you a remnant on earth and to save your life in an extraordinary deliverance .      so it be not really you but God who have I come here ; and he have make I a father to Pharaoh ,    lord of all his household , and ruler over the whole land of Egypt .      hurry back , then , to my father and tell he : thus say your son Joseph : God have make I lord of all Egypt ; come down to I without delay .        you can settle in the region of Goshen ,    where you will be near me\xe2\x80\x94you and your child and children child , your flock and herd , and everything that you own .      I will provide for you there in the five year of famine that lie ahead , so that you and your household and all that be yours will not suffer want .      surely , you can see for yourself , and Benjamin can see for himself , that it be I who be speak to you .      tell my father all about my high position in Egypt and all that you have see . but hurry and bring my father down here .      then he throw his arm around his brother Benjamin and weep on his shoulder .      Joseph then kiss all his brother and weep over they ; and only then be his brother able to talk with he .     the news reach Pharaohs house : Josephs brother have come . Pharaoh and his official be pleased .      so Pharaoh tell Joseph : say to your brother : this be what you shall do : load up your animal and go without delay to the land of Canaan .      there get your father and your household , and then come to I ; I will assign you the good land in Egypt , where you will live off the fat of the land .        instruct they far : do this . take wagon from the land of Egypt for your child and your wife and bring your father back here .      do not be concerned about your belonging , for the good in the whole land of Egypt shall be yours .     the son of Israel act accordingly . Joseph give they the wagon , as Pharaoh have order , and he supply they with provision for the journey .      he also give to each of they a set of clothe , but to Benjamin he give three hundred shekel of silver and five set of clothe .      moreover , what he send to his father be ten donkey load with the fine product of Egypt and another ten load with grain and bread and provision for his father journey .      as he send his brother on their way , he tell they , do not quarrel on the way .     so they go up from Egypt and come to the land of Canaan , to their father Jacob .      when they tell he , Joseph be still alive\xe2\x80\x94 in fact , it be he who be govern all the land of Egypt , he be unmove , for he do not believe they .      but when they recount to he all that Joseph have tell they , and when he see the wagon that Joseph have send to transport he , the spirit of their father Jacob come to life .      enough , say Israel . my son Joseph be still alive ! I must go and see he before I die .             '
