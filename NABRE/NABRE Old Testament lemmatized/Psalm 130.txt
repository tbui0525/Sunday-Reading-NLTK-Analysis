b ' prayer for Pardon and Mercy   a song of ascent . I out of the depth    I call to you ,   Lord ;    Lord , hear my cry ! may your ear be attentive   to my cry for mercy .    if you ,   Lord , keep account of sin ,   Lord , who can stand ?    but with you be forgiveness   and so you be revere .     II   I wait for the   Lord ,   my soul wait   and I hope for his word .    my soul look for the Lord   more than sentinel for daybreak .   More than sentinel for daybreak ,    let Israel hope in the   Lord , for with the   Lord   be mercy ,   with he be plenteous redemption ,    and he will redeem Israel   from all its sin .
