b '    my child , do not mock the life of the poor ;   do not keep needy eye    wait .    do not grieve the hungry ,   nor anger the needy .   do not aggravate a heart already angry ,   nor delay give to the needy .   a beggar request do not reject ;   do not turn your face away from the poor .   from the needy do not turn your eye ;   do not give they reason to curse you .   if in their pain they cry out bitterly ,   their Rock will hear the sound of their cry .    Social Conduct   Endear yourself to the assembly ;   before the citys ruler bow your head .   give a hearing to the poor ,   and return their greeting with deference ;   deliver the oppressed from their oppressor ;    right judgment should not be repugnant to you .   be like a father to orphan ,   and take the place of a husband to widow . then God will call you his child ,   and he will be merciful to you and deliver you from the pit .    the Rewards of Wisdom    Wisdom teach her child   and admonish all who can understand she .   those who love her love life ;   those who seek she out win the   Lord s favor .   those who hold she fast will attain glory ,   and they shall abide in the blessing of the   Lord .   those who serve she serve the Holy One ;   those who love she the Lord love .      whoever obey I will judge nation ;   whoever listen to I will dwell in my inmost chamber .   if they remain faithful , they will possess I ;   their descendant too will inherit I .     I will walk with they in disguise ,   and at first I will test they with trial . fear and dread I will bring upon they   and I will discipline they with my constraint . when their heart be fully with I ,    then I will set they again on the straight path   and reveal my secret to they .   but if they turn away from I , I will abandon they   and deliver they over to robber .    Sincerity and Justice    my son , watch for the right time ; fear what be evil ;   do not bring shame upon yourself .   there be a shame heavy with guilt ,   and a shame that bring glory and respect .   show no favoritism to your own discredit ;   let no one intimidate you to your own downfall .   do not refrain from speak at the proper time ,   and do not hide your wisdom ;   for wisdom becomes know through speech ,   and knowledge through the tongue response .     never speak against the truth ,   but of your own ignorance be ashamed .   do not be ashamed to acknowledge your sin ,   and do not struggle against a rush stream .   do not abase yourself before a fool ;   do not refuse to do so before ruler .   even to the death , fight for what be right ,   and the   Lord   will do battle for you .     do not be haughty in your speech ,   or lazy and slack in your deed .   do not be like a lion at home ,   or sly and suspicious with your servant .   do not let your hand be open to receive ,   but clench when it be time to give .
