b '    the wicked flee though none pursue ;   but the just , like a lion , be confident .   if a land be rebellious , its prince will be many ;   but with an intelligent and wise ruler there be stability .    one who be poor and extort from the lowly   be a devastating rain that leave no food .    those who abandon instruction    praise the wicked ,   but those who keep instruction oppose they .   the evil understand nothing of justice ,    but those who seek the   Lord   understand everything .   well to be poor and walk in integrity   than rich and crooked in one way .    whoever heed instruction be a wise son ,   but whoever join with wastrel disgrace his father .   whoever amass wealth by interest and overcharge    gather it for the one who be kind to the poor .   those who turn their ear from hear instruction ,    even their prayer be an abomination .   those who mislead the upright into an evil way   will themselves fall into their own pit ,   but the blameless will attain prosperity .   the rich be wise in their own eye ,   but the poor who be intelligent see through they .   when the just triumph , there be great glory ;   but when the wicked prevail , people hide .    those who conceal their sin do not prosper ,   but those who confess and forsake they obtain mercy .    happy those who always fear ;    but those who harden their heart fall into evil .   a roar lion or a ravenous bear   be a wicked ruler over a poor people .   the less prudent the ruler , the more oppressive their deed .   those who hate ill - get gain prolong their day .   though a person burden with blood guilt be in flight even to the grave ,   let no one offer support .   whoever walk blamelessly be safe ,   but one whose way be crooked fall into a pit .   those who cultivate their land will have plenty of food ,   but those who engage in idle pursuit will have plenty of want .    the trustworthy will be richly bless ;   but whoever hasten to be rich will not go unpunished .    to show partiality be never good :    for even a morsel of bread one may do wrong .    Misers hurry toward wealth ,   not know that want be come toward they .    whoever rebuke another win more favor   than one who flatter with the tongue .   whoever defrauds father or mother and say , it be no sin ,    be a partner to a brigand .   the greedy person stir up strife ,   but the one who trust in the   Lord   will prosper .   those who trust in themselves be fool ,   but those who walk in wisdom be safe .   those who give to the poor have no lack ,    but those who avert their eye , many curse .   when the wicked prevail , people hide ;   but at their fall the just abound .
