b '     but you , our God , be good and true ,   slow to anger , and govern all with mercy .    for even if we sin , we be yours , and know your might ;   but we will not sin , know that we belong to you .    for to know you well be complete righteousness ,   and to know your might be the root of immortality .    for the evil creation of human fancy do not deceive we ,   nor the fruitless labor of painter ,   a form smear with varied color ,    the sight of which arouse yearn in a fool ,   till he long for the inanimate form of a dead image .   lover of evil thing , and worthy of such hope   be they who make they and long for they and worship they .     the Potters Clay Idols   for the potter , laboriously work the soft earth ,   mold for our service each single article : he fashion out of the same clay   both the vessel that serve for clean purpose   and their opposite , all alike ; as to what shall be the use of each vessel of either class   the worker in clay be the judge .     with misspent toil he mold a meaningless god from the selfsame clay ,   though he himself shortly before be make from the earth , and be soon to go whence he be take ,   when the life that be lend he be demand back .    but his concern be not that he be to die   nor that his span of life be brief ; rather , he vie with goldsmith and silversmith   and emulate molder of bronze ,   and take pride in fashion counterfeit .    ash his heart be !    more worthless than earth be his hope ,    more ignoble than clay his life ;   because he know not the one who fashion he ,   and breathe into he a quicken soul ,   and infuse a vital spirit .    instead , he esteem our life a mere game ,   and our span of life a holiday for gain ; for one must , say he , make a profit in every way , be it even from evil .    for more than anyone else he know that he be sin ,   when out of earthen stuff he create fragile vessel and idol alike .     but most stupid of all and bad than senseless in mind ,   be the enemy of your people who enslave they .    for they esteem all the idol of the nation as god ,   which can not use their eye to see ,   nor nostril to breathe the air , nor ear to hear ,   nor finger on their hand for feeling ;   even their foot be useless to walk with .    for it be a mere human being who make they ;    one live on borrow breath who fashion they . for no one be able to fashion a god like himself ;    he be mortal , and what he make with lawless hand be dead . for he be well than the thing he worship ;   he at least life , but never his idol .    Second Example resume    besides , they worship the most loathsome beasts\xe2\x80\x94    as regard stupidity , these be bad than the rest ,    for beast be neither good - look nor desirable ;   they have escape both the approval of God and his blessing .
