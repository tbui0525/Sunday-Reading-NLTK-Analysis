b '   God the Savior of those in Distress   give thank to the   Lord   for he be good ,   his mercy endure forever !    let that be the prayer of the   Lord s redeem ,   those redeem from the hand of the foe ,    those gather from foreign land ,   from east and west , from north and south .     I   some have lose their way in a barren desert ;   find no path toward a city to live in .   they be hungry and thirsty ;   their life be ebb away .    in their distress they cry to the   Lord ,   who rescue they in their peril ,    guide they by a direct path   so they reach a city to live in .    let they thank the   Lord   for his mercy ,   such wondrous deed for the child of Adam .   for he satisfy the thirsty ,   fill the hungry with good thing .     II   some live in darkness and gloom ,   imprison in misery and chain .   because they rebel against Gods word ,   and scorn the counsel of the most high ,    he humble their heart through hardship ;   they stumble with no one to help .    in their distress they cry to the   Lord ,   who save they in their peril ;   he bring they forth from darkness and the shadow of death   and break their chain asunder .    let they thank the   Lord   for his mercy ,   such wondrous deed for the child of Adam .   for he break down the gate of bronze   and snap the bar of iron .    III   some fall sick from their wicked way ,   afflict because of their sin .   they loathe all manner of food ;    they be at the gate of death .   in their distress they cry to the   Lord ,   who save they in their peril ,   Sent forth his word to heal they ,    and snatch they from the grave .   let they thank the   Lord   for his mercy ,   such wondrous deed for the child of Adam .   let they offer a sacrifice in thank ,   recount his work with shout of joy .    IV   some go off to sea in ship ,   ply their trade on the deep water .    they see the work of the   Lord ,   the wonder of God in the deep .   he command and rouse a storm wind ;   it toss the wave on high .    they rise up to the heaven , sink to the depth ;   their heart tremble at the danger .   they reel , stagger like drunkard ;   their skill be of no avail .    in their distress they cry to the   Lord ,   who bring they out of their peril ;   he hush the storm to silence ,   the wave of the sea be still .    they rejoice that the sea grow calm ,   that God bring they to the harbor they long for .   let they thank the   Lord   for his mercy ,   such wondrous deed for the child of Adam .   let they extol he in the assembly of the people ,   and praise he in the council of the elder .    V    God change river into desert ,   spring of water into thirsty ground ,    fruitful land into a salty waste ,   because of the wickedness of its people .    he change the desert into pool of water ,   arid land into spring of water ,    and settle the hungry there ;   they build a city to live in .    they sow field and plant vineyard ,   bring in an abundant harvest .     God bless they , and they increase greatly ,   and their livestock do not decrease .    but he pour out contempt on prince ,   make they wander trackless waste ,   where they be diminish and bring low   through misery and cruel oppression .   while he release the poor man from affliction ,   and increase their family like flock .    the upright see this and rejoice ;    all wickedness shut its mouth .   whoever be wise will take note of these thing ,    and ponder the merciful deed of the   Lord .
