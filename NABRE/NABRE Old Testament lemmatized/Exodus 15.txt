b '    then Moses and the Israelites sing    this song to the   Lord :   I will sing to the   Lord , for he be gloriously triumphant ;   horse and chariot he have cast into the sea .   my strength and my refuge be the   Lord ,   and he have become my savior .   this be my God , I praise he ;   the God of my father , I extol he .   the   Lord   be a warrior ,   Lord   be his name !   Pharaohs chariot and army he hurl into the sea ;   the elite of his officer be drown in the Red Sea .    the flood water cover they ,   they sink into the depth like a stone .    your right hand , O   Lord , magnificent in power ,   your right hand , O   Lord , shatter the enemy .   in your great majesty you overthrow your adversary ;   you loose your wrath to consume they like stubble .   at the blast of your nostril the water pile up ,   the flow water stand like a mound ,   the flood water foam in the midst of the sea .   the enemy boast , I will pursue and overtake they ;   I will divide the spoil and have my fill of they ;   I will draw my sword ; my hand will despoil they !   when you blow with your breath , the sea cover they ;   like lead they sink in the mighty water .   who be like you among the god , o   Lord ?   who be like you , magnificent among the holy one ? Awe - inspire in deed of renown , worker of wonder ,    when you stretch out your right hand , the earth swallow they !   in your love    you lead the people you redeem ;   in your strength you guide they to your holy dwelling .   the people hear and quake ;   anguish grip the dweller in Philistia .   then be the chieftain of Edom dismayed ,   the noble of Moab seize by tremble ; all the inhabitant of Canaan melt away ;     terror and dread fall upon they . by the might of your arm they become silent like stone ,   while your people ,   Lord , pass over ,   while the people whom you create pass over .    you bring they in , you plant they   on the mountain that be your own\xe2\x80\x94 the place you make the base of your throne ,   Lord ,   the sanctuary ,   Lord , your hand establish .   may the   Lord   reign forever and ever !     when Pharaohs horse and chariot and horseman enter the sea , the   Lord   make the water of the sea flow back upon they , though the Israelites walk on dry land through the midst of the sea .        then the prophet Miriam , Aarons sister , take a tambourine in her hand , while all the woman go out after she with tambourine , dancing ;      and she respond    to they : sing to the   Lord , for he be gloriously triumphant ;   horse and chariot he have cast into the sea .      at Marah and Elim .      then Moses lead Israel forward from the Red Sea ,    and they march out to the wilderness of Shur . after travel for three day through the wilderness without find water ,      they arrive at Marah , where they could not drink its water , because it be too bitter . hence this place be call Marah .      as the people grumble against Moses , say , what be we to drink ?      he cry out to the   Lord , who point out to he a piece of wood . when he throw it into the water , the water become fresh .   it be here that God , in make statute and ordinance for they , put they to the test .      he say : if you listen closely to the voice of the   Lord , your God , and do what be right in his eye : if you heed his commandment and keep all his statute , I will not afflict you with any of the disease with which I afflict the Egyptians ;    for I , the   Lord , be your healer .     then they come to Elim , where there be twelve spring of water and seventy palm tree , and they camp there near the water .
