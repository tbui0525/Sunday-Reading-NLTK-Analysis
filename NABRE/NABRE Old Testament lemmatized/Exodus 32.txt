b ' VII . Israels Apostasy and Gods Renewal of the Covenant   the Golden Calf .     when the people see that Moses be delay in come down from the mountain , they gather around Aaron and say to he , come , make we a god who will go before we ; as for that man Moses who bring we out of the land of Egypt , we do not know what have happen to he .        Aaron reply , take off the golden earring that your wife , your son , and your daughter be wear , and bring they to I .      so all the people take off their earring and bring they to Aaron .      he receive their offering , and fashion it with a tool , make a molten calf . then they cry out , these be your god , Israel , who bring you    up from the land of Egypt .        on see this , Aaron build an altar in front of the calf and proclaim , tomorrow be a feast of the   Lord .      early the next day the people sacrifice burn offering and bring communion sacrifice . then they sit down to eat and drink , and rise up to revel .       then the   Lord   say to Moses : go down at once because your people , whom you bring out of the land of Egypt , have act corruptly .      they have quickly turn aside from the way I command they , make for themselves a molten calf and bow down to it , sacrifice to it and cry out , these be your god , Israel , who bring you up from the land of Egypt !       I have see this people , how stiff - necked they be , continue the   Lord   to Moses .      let I alone , then , that my anger may burn against they to consume they . then I will make of you a great nation .      but Moses implore the   Lord , his God , say ,    why , o   Lord , should your anger burn against your people , whom you bring out of the land of Egypt with great power and with a strong hand ?      why should the Egyptians say , with evil intent he bring they out , that he might kill they in the mountain and wipe they off the face of the earth ? turn from your burn wrath ; change your mind about punish your people .      remember your servant Abraham , Isaac , and Israel , and how you swear to they by your own self , say ,    I will make your descendant as numerous as the star in the sky ; and all this land that I promise , I will give your descendant as their perpetual heritage .      so the   Lord   change his mind about the punishment he have threaten to inflict on his people .     Moses then turn and come down the mountain with the two tablet of the covenant in his hand ,    tablet that be write on both side , front and back .      the tablet be make by God ; the writing be the writing of God , engrave on the tablet .        now , when Joshua hear the noise of the people shout , he say to Moses , that sound like a battle in the camp .      but Moses answer , it be not the noise of victory ,   it be not the noise of defeat ;   the sound I hear be singe .     as he draw near the camp , he see the calf and the dancing . then Moses anger burn , and he throw the tablet down and break they on the base of the mountain .        take the calf they have make , he burn it in the fire and then grind it down to powder , which he scatter on the water    and make the Israelites drink .       Moses ask Aaron , what do this people do to you that you should lead they into a grave sin ?      Aaron reply , do not let my lord be angry . you know how the people be prone to evil .      they say to I , make we a god to go before we ; as for this man Moses who bring we out of the land of Egypt , we do not know what have happen to he .      so I tell they , whoever be wear gold , take it off . they give it to I , and I throw it into the fire , and this calf come out .     Moses see that the people be run wild because Aaron have lose control\xe2\x80\x94to the secret delight of their foe .      Moses stand at the gate of the camp and shout , whoever be for the   Lord , come to I ! all the Levites    then rally to he ,      and he tell they , thus say the   Lord , the God of Israel : each of you put your sword on your hip ! go back and forth through the camp , from gate to gate , and kill your brother , your friend , your neighbor !      the Levites do as Moses have command , and that day about three thousand of the people fall .      then Moses say , today you be instal as priest    for the   Lord , for you go against your own son and brother , to bring a blessing upon yourself this day .    the Atonement .     on the next day Moses say to the people ,    you have commit a grave sin . now I will go up to the   Lord ; perhaps I may be able to make atonement for your sin .      so Moses return to the   Lord   and say , ah , this people have commit a grave sin in make a god of gold for themselves !      now if you would only forgive their sin ! but if you will not , then blot I out of the book that you have write .        the   Lord   answer Moses : only the one who have sin against I will I blot out of my book .      now , go and lead the people where I have tell you . see , my angel will go before you . when it be time for I to punish , I will punish they for their sin .     thus the   Lord   strike the people for make the calf , the one that Aaron make .
