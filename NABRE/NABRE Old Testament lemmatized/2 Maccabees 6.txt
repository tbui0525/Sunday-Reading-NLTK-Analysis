b '   abolition of Judaism .      not long after this the king send an athenian senator    to force the Jews to abandon the law of their ancestor and live no long by the law of God ,      also to profane the temple in Jerusalem and dedicate it to Olympian Zeus ,    and the one on Mount Gerizim to Zeus the Host to Strangers , as the local inhabitant be will not to be .        this be a harsh and utterly intolerable evil .      the Gentiles fill the temple with debauchery and revelry ; they amuse themselves with prostitute and have intercourse with woman even in the sacred court . they also bring forbidden thing into the temple ,        so that the altar be cover with abominable offering prohibit by the law .     no one could keep the sabbath or celebrate the traditional feast , nor even admit to be a Jew .      moreover , at the monthly celebration of the king birthday the Jews , from bitter necessity , have to partake of the sacrifice , and when the festival of Dionysus    be celebrate , they be compel to march in his procession , wear wreath of ivy .      follow upon a vote of the citizen of Ptolemais , a decree be issue order the neighboring greek city to adopt the same measure , oblige the Jews to partake of the sacrifice      and put to death those who would not consent to adopt the custom of the Greeks . it be obvious , therefore , that disaster have come upon they .      thus , two woman who be arrest for having circumcise their child be publicly parade about the city with their baby hang at their breast and then throw down from the top of the city wall .        other , who have assemble in nearby cave to observe the seventh day in secret , be betray to Philip and all burn to death . in their respect for the holiness of that day , they refrain from defend themselves .     Gods Purpose .      now I urge those who read this book not to be dishearten by these misfortune , but to consider that these punishment be mean not for the ruin but for the correction of our nation .      it be , in fact , a sign of great kindness to punish the impious promptly instead of let they go for long .       thus , in deal with other nation , the Sovereign Lord patiently wait until they reach the full measure of their sin before punish they ; but with we he have decide to deal differently ,      in order that he may not have to punish we later , when our sin have reach their fullness .      therefore he never withdraw his mercy from we . although he discipline we with misfortune , he do not abandon his own people .      let these word suffice for recall this truth . without further ado we must go on with our story .    Martyrdom of Eleazar .      Eleazar , one of the foremost scribe , a man advance in age and of noble appearance , be be force to open his mouth to eat pork .        but prefer a glorious death to a life of defilement , he go forward of his own accord to the instrument of torture ,      spit out the meat as they should do who have the courage to reject food unlawful to taste even for love of life .     those in charge of that unlawful sacrifice take the man aside , because of their long acquaintance with he , and privately urge he to bring his own provision that he could legitimately eat , and only to pretend to eat the sacrificial meat prescribe by the king .      thus he would escape death , and be treat kindly because of his old friendship with they .      but he make up his mind in a noble manner , worthy of his year , the dignity of his advanced age , the merit distinction of his gray hair , and of the admirable life he have live from childhood . above all loyal to the holy law give by God , he swiftly declare , send I to Hades !     at our age it would be unbecome to make such a pretense ; many of the young would think the ninety - year - old Eleazar have go over to an alien religion .      if I dissemble to gain a brief moment of life , they would be lead astray by I , while I would bring defilement and dishonor on my old age .      even if , for the time be , I avoid human punishment , I shall never , whether alive or dead , escape the hand of the Almighty .      therefore , by bravely give up life now , I will prove myself worthy of my old age ,      and I will leave to the young a noble example of how to die willingly and nobly for the revered and holy law . he speak thus , and go immediately to the instrument of torture .      those who shortly before have be kindly dispose , now become hostile toward he because what he have say seem to they utter madness .        when he be about to die under the blow , he groan , say : the Lord in his holy knowledge know full well that , although I could have escape death , I be not only endure terrible pain in my body from this scourging , but also suffer it with joy in my soul because of my devotion to he .      this be how he die , leave in his death a model of nobility and an unforgettable example of virtue not only for the young but for the whole nation .
