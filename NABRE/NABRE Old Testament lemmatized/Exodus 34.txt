b '   Renewal of the tablet .     the   Lord   say to Moses : cut two stone tablet like the former ,    that I may write on they the word    which be on the former tablet that you break .      get ready for tomorrow morning , when you be to go up Mount Sinai and there present yourself to I on the top of the mountain .      no one shall come up with you , and let no one even be see on any part of the mountain ;    even the sheep and the cattle be not to graze in front of this mountain .      Moses then cut two stone tablet like the former , and early the next morning he go up Mount Sinai as the   Lord   have command he , take in his hand the two stone tablet .     the   Lord   come down in a cloud and stand with he there and proclaim the name ,   Lord .      so the   Lord   pass before he and proclaim : the   Lord , the   Lord , a God gracious and merciful , slow to anger and abound in love and fidelity ,        continue his love for a thousand generation , and forgive wickedness , rebellion , and sin ; yet not declare the guilty guiltless , but bring punishment for their parent wickedness on child and children child to the third and fourth generation !        Moses at once kneel and bow down to the ground .      then he say , if I find favor with you , Lord , please , Lord , come along in our company . this be indeed a stiff - necked people ; yet pardon our wickedness and sin , and claim we as your own .    religious Laws .     the   Lord   say : here be the covenant I will make . before all your people I will perform marvel never before do    in any nation anywhere on earth , so that all the people among whom you live may see the work of the   Lord . Awe - inspire be the deed I will perform with you !      as for you , observe what I be command you today .   see , I be about to drive out before you the Amorites , Canaanites , Hittites , Perizzites , Hivites and Jebusites .       take care not to make a covenant with the inhabitant of the land that you be to enter ; lest they become a snare among you .      tear down their altar ; smash their sacred stone , and cut down their asherah .        you shall not bow down to any other god , for the   Lord \xe2\x80\x94Jealous    his name\xe2\x80\x94is a jealous God .      do not make a covenant with the inhabitant of the land ; else , when they prostitute themselves with their god and sacrifice to they , one of they may invite you and you may partake of the sacrifice .      and when you take their daughter as wife for your son , and their daughter prostitute themselves with their god , they will make your son do the same .     you shall not make for yourself molten god .      you shall keep the festival of Unleavened Bread .    for seven day at the appoint time in the month of Abib you be to eat unleavened bread , as I command you ; for in the month of Abib you come out of Egypt .     to I belong every male that open the womb among all your livestock , whether in the herd or in the flock .        the firstling of a donkey you shall redeem with a lamb ; if you do not redeem it , you must break its neck . the firstborn among your son you shall redeem . no one shall appear before I empty - handed .     six day you may labor ,    but on the seventh day you shall rest ; even during the season of plow and harvesting you must rest .      you shall keep the feast of Weeks with the first fruit of the wheat harvest , likewise , the feast of the Ingathering at the close of the year .        three time a year all your man shall appear before the Lord , the   Lord   God of Israel .      since I will drive out the nation before you and enlarge your territory , no one will covet your land when you go up three time a year to appear before the   Lord , your God .     you shall not offer I the blood of sacrifice with anything leaven , nor shall the sacrifice of the Passover feast be keep overnight for the next day .     the choice first fruit of your soil you shall bring to the house of the   Lord , your God . you shall not boil a young goat in its mother milk .     Radiance of Moses Face .     then the   Lord   say to Moses : write down these word , for in accordance with these word I have make a covenant with you and with Israel .      so Moses be there with the   Lord   for forty day and forty night ,    without eat any food or drink any water , and he write on the tablet the word of the covenant , the ten word .     as Moses come down from Mount Sinai with the two tablet of the covenant in his hand , he do not know that the skin of his face have become radiant    while he speak with the   Lord .      when Aaron , then , and the other Israelites see Moses and notice how radiant the skin of his face have become , they be afraid to come near he .      only after Moses call to they do Aaron and all the leader of the community come back to he . Moses then speak to they .      later , all the Israelites come up to he , and he enjoin on they all that the   Lord   have tell he on Mount Sinai .      when Moses finish speak with they , he put a veil over his face .      whenever Moses enter the presence of the   Lord   to speak with he , he remove the veil until he come out again .    on come out , he would tell the Israelites all that he have be command .      then the Israelites would see that the skin of Moses face be radiant ; so he would again put the veil over his face until he go in to speak with the   Lord .
