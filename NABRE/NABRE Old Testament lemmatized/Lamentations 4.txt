b '   Miseries of the Besieged City    how the gold have lose its luster ,   the noble metal change ; jewel    lie scatter   at the corner of every street .     and zion precious child ,   worth their weight in gold\xe2\x80\x94 how they be treat like clay jug ,   the work of any potter !      even jackal offer their breast   to nurse their young ; but the daughter of my people be as cruel   as the ostrich    in the wilderness .      the tongue of the infant cleave   to the roof of its mouth in thirst ; child beg for bread ,   but no one give they a piece .     those who feast on delicacy   be abandon in the street ; those who recline on crimson    now embrace dung heap .      the punishment of the daughter of my people   surpass the penalty of Sodom , which be overthrow in an instant   with no hand lay on it .      her prince be bright than snow ,   white than milk , their body more ruddy than coral ,   their beauty like the sapphire .     now their appearance be blacker than soot ,   they go unrecognized in the street ; their skin have shrink on their bone ,   and become dry as wood .      well for those pierce by the sword   than for those pierce by hunger , well for those who bleed from wound   than for those who lack food .     the hand of compassionate woman   have boil their own child ! they become their food   when the daughter of my people be shatter .      the   Lord   have exhaust his anger ,   pour out his blaze wrath ; he have kindle a fire in Zion   that have consume her foundation .      the king of the earth do not believe ,   nor any of the world inhabitant , that foe or enemy could enter   the gate of Jerusalem .     except for the sin of her prophet   and the crime of her priest , who pour out in her midst   the blood of the just .      they stagger blindly in the street ,   defile with blood , so that people could not touch   even their garment :      go away ! unclean ! they cry to they ,   away , away , do not touch ! if they go away and wander ,   it would be say among the nation ,   they can no long live here !     the presence of the   Lord   be their portion ,   but he no long look upon they . the priest be show no regard ,   the elder , no mercy .     even now our eye be wear out ,   search in vain for help ; from our watchtower we have watch   for a nation    unable to save .     they dog our every step ,   we could not walk in our square ; our end draw near , our time be up ;   yes , our end have come .     our pursuer be swift   than eagle in the sky , in the mountain they be hot on our trail ,   they ambush we in the wilderness .      the   Lord s anointed\xe2\x80\x94our very lifebreath!\xe2\x80\x94    be catch in their snare , he in whose shade we think   to live among the nation .      rejoice and gloat , daughter Edom ,   dwell in the land of Uz ,   the cup will pass to you as well ;   you shall become drunk and strip yourself naked !      your punishment be complete , daughter Zion ,   the Lord will not prolong your exile ; the Lord will punish your iniquity , daughter Edom ,   will lay bare your sin .
