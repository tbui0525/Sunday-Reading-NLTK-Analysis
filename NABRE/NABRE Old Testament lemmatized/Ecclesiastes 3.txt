b '   no one can determine the Right Time to Act    there be an appoint time for everything ,   and a time for every affair under the heavens .   a time to give birth , and a time to die ;   a time to plant , and a time to uproot the plant .   a time to kill , and a time to heal ;   a time to tear down , and a time to build .   a time to weep , and a time to laugh ;   a time to mourn , and a time to dance .   a time to scatter stone , and a time to gather they ;   a time to embrace , and a time to be far from embrace .   a time to seek , and a time to lose ;   a time to keep , and a time to cast away .   a time to rend , and a time to sew ;   a time to be silent , and a time to speak .   a time to love , and a time to hate ;   a time of war , and a time of peace .      what profit have worker from their toil ?      I have see the business that God have give to mortal to be busy about .       God have make everything appropriate to its time , but have put the timeless    into their heart so they can not find out , from begin to end , the work which God have do .       I recognize that there be nothing well than to rejoice and to do well during life .      moreover , that all can eat and drink and enjoy the good of all their toil\xe2\x80\x94this be a gift of God .      I recognize that whatever God do will endure forever ; there be no adding to it , or take from it . thus have God do that he may be revere .        what now be have already be ; what be to be , already be : God retrieve what have go by .    the Problem of Retribution .      and still under the sun in the judgment place I see wickedness , and wickedness also in the seat of justice .       I say in my heart , both the just and the wicked God will judge , since a time be set for every affair and for every work .        I say in my heart : as for human being , it be Gods way of test they and of show that they be in themselves like beast .      for the lot of mortal and the lot of beast be the same lot : the one die as well as the other . both have the same life breath . human being have no advantage over beast , but all be vanity .       both go to the same place ; both be make from the dust , and to the dust they both return .      who know    if the life breath of mortal go upward and the life breath of beast go earthward ?       and I see that there be nothing well for mortal than to rejoice in their work ; for this be their lot . who will let they see what be to come after they ?
