b '   I   why ,   Lord , do you stand afar   and pay no heed in time of trouble ?   arrogant scoundrel pursue the poor ;   they trap they by their cunning scheme .     II   the wicked even boast of their greed ;   these robber curse and scorn the   Lord .    in their insolence the wicked boast :   God do not care ; there be no God .     yet their affair always succeed ;   they ignore your judgment on high ;   they sneer at all who oppose they .   they say in their heart , we will never fall ;   never will we see misfortune .   their mouth be full of oath , violence , and lie ;   discord and evil be under their tongue .    they wait in ambush near town ;   their eye watch for the helpless   to murder the innocent in secret .    they lurk in ambush like lion in a thicket ,   hide there to trap the poor ,   snare they and close the net .    the helpless be crush , lay low ;   they fall into the power of the wicked ,   who say in their heart , God have forget ,   show no concern , never bother to look .     III   rise up ,   Lord ! God , lift up your hand !   do not forget the poor !   why should the wicked scorn God ,   say in their heart , God do not care ?   but you do see ;   you take note of misery and sorrow ;    you take the matter in hand . to you the helpless can entrust their cause ;   you be the defender of orphan .    break the arm of the wicked and depraved ;   make they account for their crime ;   let none of they survive .    IV   the   Lord   be king forever ;    the nation have vanish from his land .   you listen ,   Lord , to the need of the poor ;   you strengthen their heart and incline your ear .   you win justice for the orphan and oppress ;    no one on earth will cause terror again .
