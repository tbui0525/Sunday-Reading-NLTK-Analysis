b ' Thanksgiving to God who deliver the just   of David , when he feign madness before Abimelech ,    who drive he out and he go away .    I   I will bless the   Lord   at all time ;   his praise shall be always in my mouth .    my soul will glory in the   Lord ;   let the poor hear and be glad .   magnify the   Lord   with I ;   and let we exalt his name together .    II   I seek the   Lord , and he answer I ,   deliver I from all my fear .   look to he and be radiant ,   and your face may not blush for shame .   this poor one cry out and the   Lord   hear ,   and from all his distress he save he .   the angel of the   Lord   encamp   around those who fear he , and he save they .    taste and see that the   Lord   be good ;   bless be the stalwart one who take refuge in he .    fear the   Lord , you his holy one ;   nothing be lack to those who fear he .    the rich grow poor and go hungry ,   but those who seek the   Lord   lack no good thing .    III   Come , child ,    listen to I ;    I will teach you fear of the   Lord .   who be the man who delight in life ,    who love to see the good day ?   keep your tongue from evil ,   your lip from speak lie .   turn from evil and do good ;    seek peace and pursue it .   the eye of the   Lord   be direct toward the righteous    and his ear toward their cry .   the   Lord s face be against evildoer   to wipe out their memory from the earth .   the righteous cry out , the   Lord   hear   and he rescue they from all their affliction .   the   Lord   be close to the brokenhearted ,   save those whose spirit be crush .   many be the trouble of the righteous ,   but the   Lord   deliver he from they all .   he watch over all his bone ;   not one of they shall be break .    Evil will slay the wicked ;   those who hate the righteous be condemn .   the   Lord   be the redeemer of the soul of his servant ;   and none be condemn who take refuge in he .             '
