b '     remember your creator in the day of your youth ,   before the evil day come and the year approach of which you will say ,   I have no pleasure in they ;   before the sun be darken   and the light and the moon and the star   and the cloud return after the rain ;    when the guardian of the house tremble ,   and the strong man be bent ; when the woman who grind be idle because they be few ,   and those who look through the window grow blind ;   when the door to the street be shut ,   and the sound of the mill be low ; when one rise at the call of a bird ,   and all the daughter of song be quiet ;   when one be afraid of height ,   and peril in the street ; when the almond tree bloom ,   and the locust grow sluggish   and the caper berry be without effect , because mortal go to their lasting home ,   and mourner go about the street ;    before the silver cord be snap   and the golden bowl be break , and the pitcher be shatter at the spring ,   and the pulley be break at the well ,   and the dust return to the earth as it once be ,   and the life breath return to God who give it .     Vanity of vanity , say Qoheleth ,   all thing be vanity !     Epilogue .      besides be wise , Qoheleth teach the people knowledge , and weigh , scrutinize and arrange many proverb .      Qoheleth seek to find appropriate saying , and to write down true saying with precision .      the saying of the wise be like goad ; like fix spike be the collect saying give by one shepherd .         as to more than these ,    my son , beware . of the making of many book there be no end , and in much study there be weariness for the flesh .       the last word , when all be hear : fear God and keep his commandment , for this concern all humankind ;       because God will bring to judgment every work , with all its hidden quality , whether good or bad .
