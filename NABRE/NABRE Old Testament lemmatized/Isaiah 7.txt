b '   the Syro - Ephraimite War   Crisis in Judah .     in the day of Ahaz ,    king of Judah , son of Jotham , son of Uzziah , Rezin , king of Aram , and Pekah , king of Israel , son of Remaliah , go up to attack Jerusalem , but they be not able to conquer it .        when word come to the house of David that Aram have ally itself with Ephraim , the heart of the king and heart of the people tremble , as the tree of the forest tremble in the wind .     then the   Lord   say to Isaiah : go out to meet Ahaz , you and your son Shear - jashub ,    at the end of the conduit of the upper pool , on the highway to the fuller field ,      and say to he : take care you remain calm and do not fear ; do not let your courage fail before these two stump of smolder brand ,    the blaze anger of Rezin and the Arameans and of the son of Remaliah\xe2\x80\x94      because Aram , with Ephraim and the son of Remaliah , have plan    evil against you . they say ,      let we go up against Judah , tear it apart , make it our own by force , and appoint the son of Tabeel    king there .     thus say the Lord   God :   it shall not stand , it shall not be !     the head of Aram be Damascus ,   and the head of Damascus be Rezin ;   the head of Ephraim be Samaria ,   and the head of Samaria be the son of Remaliah . within sixty - five year ,   Ephraim shall be crush , no long a nation . unless your faith be firm ,   you shall not be firm !     Emmanuel .     again the   Lord   speak to Ahaz :      ask for a sign from the   Lord , your God ; let it be deep as Sheol , or high as the sky !        but Ahaz answer , I will not ask ! I will not tempt the   Lord !        then he say : listen , house of David ! be it not enough that you weary human being ? must you also weary my God ?      therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign ;    the young woman , pregnant and about to bear a son , shall name he Emmanuel .      Curds and honey    he will eat so that he may learn to reject evil and choose good ;      for before the child learn to reject evil and choose good , the land of those two king whom you dread shall be desert .     the   Lord   shall bring upon you and your people and your father house such day as have not come since Ephraim secede    from Judah ( the king of Assyria ) .      on that day the   Lord   shall whistle   for the fly in the farth stream of Egypt ,   and for the bee in the land of Assyria .    all of they shall come and settle   in the steep ravine and in the rocky cleft ,   on all thornbushe and in all pasture .      on that day the Lord shall shave with the razor hire from across the River ( the king of Assyria ) the head , and the hair of the foot ; it shall also shave off the beard .      on that day a man shall keep alive a young cow or a couple of sheep ,      and from their abundant yield of milk he shall eat curds ; curds and honey shall be the food of all who be leave in the land .       on that day every place where there be a thousand vine worth a thousand piece of silver shall become brier and thorn .      one shall have to go there with bow and arrow , for all the country shall be brier and thorn .        but as for all the hill which be hoe with a mattock , for fear of brier and thorn you will not go there ; they shall become a place for cattle to roam and sheep to trample .
