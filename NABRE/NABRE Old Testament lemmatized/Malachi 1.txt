b '     an oracle . the word of the   Lord   to Israel through Malachi .    Israel prefer to Edom    I love you , say the   Lord ;   but you say , how do you love we ?     be not Esau Jacobs brother?\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord .   I love Jacob , but reject Esau ; I make his mountain a waste ,   his heritage a desert for jackal .    if Edom say , we have be crush ,   but we will rebuild the ruin , thus say the   Lord   of host :   they indeed may build , but I will tear down , and they shall be call territory of wickedness ,   the people with whom the   Lord   be angry forever .    your own eye will see it , and you will say ,   Great be the   Lord , even beyond the territory of Israel .    offense in Sacrifice and Priestly Duty    a son honor his father ,   and a servant fear his master ; if , then , I be a father ,   where be the honor due to I ? and if I be a master ,   where be the fear due to I ? so say the   Lord   of host to you , o priest ,   who disdain my name . but you ask , how have we disdain your name ?    by offer defile food on my altar ! you ask , how have we defile it ?   by say that the table of the   Lord   may be disdain !     when you offer a blind animal for sacrifice ,   be there no wrong in that ? when you offer a lame or sick animal ,   be there no wrong in that ? present it to your governor !   will he be pleased with you\xe2\x80\x94or show you favor ?   say the   Lord   of host .   so now implore Gods favor , that he may have mercy on we !   you be the one who have do this ; will he show favor to any of you ?   say the   Lord   of host .    oh , that one of you would just shut the temple gate   to keep you from kindle fire on my altar in vain ! I take no pleasure in you , say the   Lord   of host ;   and I will not accept any offering from your hand !    from the rise of the sun to its setting ,   my name be great among the nation ; incense offering be make to my name everywhere ,   and a pure offering ; for my name be great among the nation ,   say the   Lord   of host .   but you profane it by say   that the   Lord s table be defile ,   and its food may be disdain .   you say , see what a burden this be !   and you exasperate I , say the   Lord   of host ; you bring in what be mutilate , or lame , or sick ;   you bring it as an offering ! will I accept it from your hand ?   say the   Lord .   curse be the cheat who have in his flock an intact male ,   and vow it , but sacrifice to the   Lord   a defective one instead ; for a great king be I , say the   Lord   of host ,   and my name be fear among the nation .
