b '     a copy of the letter which Jeremiah send to those lead captive to Babylon by the king of the Babylonians , to tell they what God have command he :   for the sin you commit before God , you be be lead captive to Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar , king of the Babylonians .      when you reach Babylon you will be there many year , a long time\xe2\x80\x94seven generation ;    after that I will bring you back from there in peace .      and now in Babylon you will see god of silver and gold and wood , carry shoulder high , to cast fear upon the nation .         take care that you yourself do not become like these foreigner and let not such fear possess you .      when you see the crowd before they and behind worship they , say in your heart , you , Lord , be the one to be worship !        for my angel    be with you , and he will keep watch on you .      their tongue be smoothed by woodworker ; they be cover with gold and silver\xe2\x80\x94but they be fraud , and can not speak .        People bring gold , as though for a girl fond of dress up ,      and prepare crown for the head of their god . then sometimes the priest filch the gold and silver from their god and spend it on themselves ,      or give part of it to harlot    in the brothel . they dress they up in clothe like human being , these god of silver and gold and wood .      though they be wrap in purple clothing , they be not safe from rust and corrosion .      their face be wipe clean of the cloud of dust which be thick upon they .      each have a scepter , like the human ruler of a district , but none can do away with those that offend against it .      each have in its right hand an ax or dagger , but it can not save itself from war or pillage . thus it be know they be not god ; do not fear they .     as useless as a broken pot        be their god , set up in their temple , their eye full of dust from the foot of those who enter .      their courtyard be wall in like those of someone bring to execution for a crime against the king ; the priest reinforce their temple with gate and bar and bolt , so they will not be carry off by robber .      they light more lamp for they than for themselves , yet not one of these can they see .      they be like any timber in the temple ; their heart , it be say , be eat away . though crawl creature from the ground consume they and their garment , they do not feel it .      their face become sooty from the smoke in the temple .      Bats and swallow alight on their body and heads\xe2\x80\x94any bird , and cat as well .      know , therefore , that they be not god ; do not fear they .     Gold adorn they , but unless someone wipe away the corrosion , they do not shine ; they feel nothing when they be mold .      they be buy at whatever price , but there be no spirit in they .      since they have no foot , they be carry shoulder high , display to all how worthless they be ; even those who worship they be put to shame        because , if they fall to the ground , the worshiper must pick they up . they neither move of themselves if one set they upright , nor come upright if they be tip over ; offering be set out for they as for the dead .         their priest sell their sacrifice for their own advantage . likewise their wife cure some of the meat , but they do not share it with the poor and the weak ;        woman ritually unclean or at childbirth handle their sacrifice . from such thing , know that they be not god ; do not fear they .     how can they be call god ? woman set out the offering for these god of silver and gold and wood ,      and in their temple the priest squat with torn tunic and with shaven hair and beard , and with their head uncover .        they shout and wail before their god as other do at a funeral banquet .      the priest take some of the clothing from their god and put it on their wife and child .       whether these god be treat well or badly by anyone , they can not repay it . they can neither set up nor remove a king .        they can not give anyone rich or penny ; if one fail to fulfill a vow to they , they will not exact it .      they neither save anyone from death , nor deliver the weak from the strong ,        nor do they restore sight to the blind , or rescue anyone in distress .      the widow they do not pity , the orphan they do not help .      these gilded and silvered wooden statue be no well than stone from the mountain ; their worshiper will be put to shame .      how then can it be think or claim that they be god ?     even the Chaldeans themselves have no respect for they ; for when they see a deaf mute , unable to speak , they bring forward Bel    and expect he to make a sound , as though he could hear .      they themselves be unable to reflect and abandon these god , for they have no sense .       and the woman , with cord around they , sit by the road , burn chaff for incense ;        and whenever one of they be take aside by some passerby who lie with she , she mock her neighbor who have not be think thus worthy , and have not have her cord break .      all that be do for these god be a fraud ; how then can it be think or claim that they be god ?     they be produce by woodworker and goldsmith ; they be nothing other than what these artisan wish they to be .      even those who produce they be not long - live ;      how then can the thing they have produce be god ? they have leave fraud and disgrace to their successor .      for when war or disaster come upon they , the priest deliberate among themselves where they can hide with they .      how then can one not understand that these be not god , who save themselves neither from war nor from disaster ?      being that be wooden , gild and silver , they will later be know for fraud . to all nation and king it will be clear that they be not god , but human handiwork ; and that Gods work be not in they .      be it not obvious that they be not god ?      they set no king over the land , nor do they give rain .      they neither vindicate their own right , nor do they rescue anyone wrong , for they be powerless .      they be like crow in midair . for when fire break out in the temple of these wooden or gilded or silvered god , though the priest flee and be safe , they themselves be burn up in the fire like timber .      they can not resist a king or enemy force .      how then can it be admit or think that they be god ? they be safe from neither thief nor bandit , these wooden and silvered and gilded god .      anyone who can will strip off the gold and the silver , and go away with the clothing that be on they ; they can not help themselves .      how much well to be a king display his valor , or a handy tool in a house , the joy of its owner , than these false god ; well the door of a house , protect whatever be within , than these false god ; well a wooden post in a palace , than these false god !         the sun and moon and star be bright , obedient in the task for which they be send .      likewise the lightning , when it flash , be a great sight ; and the one wind blow over every land .      the cloud , too , when command by God to proceed across the whole world , fulfill the command ;      and fire , send from on high to burn up the mountain and the forest , carry out its command . but these false god be not their equal , whether in appearance or in power .      so it be unthinkable , and can not be claim that they be god . they can neither execute judgment , nor benefit anyone .      know , therefore , that they be not god ; do not fear they .     king they can neither curse nor bless .      they show the nation no sign in the heaven , nor do they shine like the sun , nor give light like the moon .      the beast be well than they\xe2\x80\x94beasts can help themselves by flee to shelter .      thus be it in no way apparent to we that they be god ; so do not fear they .     for like a scarecrow in a cucumber patch ,    provide no protection , be their wooden , gild , silvered god .      just like a thornbush in a garden on which perch every kind of bird , or like a corpse hurl into darkness , be their wooden , gild , silvered god .      from the rotting of the purple and the linen upon they , you can know that they be not god ; they themselves will in the end be consume , and be a disgrace in the land .      well the just who have no idol ; such shall be far from disgrace !
