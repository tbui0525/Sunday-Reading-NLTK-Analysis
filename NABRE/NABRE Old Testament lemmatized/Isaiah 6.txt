b '   chapter 6 the Sending of Isaiah .     in the year King Uzziah die ,    I see the Lord seat on a high and lofty throne ,    with the train of his garment fill the temple .      Seraphim    be station above ; each of they have six wing : with two they cover their face , with two they cover their foot , and with two they hover .        one cry out to the other : holy , holy , holy    be the   Lord   of host !   all the earth be fill with his glory !     at the sound of that cry , the frame of the door shake and the house be fill with smoke .       then I say , Woe be I , I be doom !    for I be a man of unclean lip , live among a people of unclean lip ,    and my eye have see the King , the   Lord   of host !      then one of the seraphim fly to I , hold an ember which he have take with tong from the altar .     he touch my mouth with it . see , he say , now that this have touch your lip ,    your wickedness be remove , your sin purge .      then I hear the voice of the Lord say , whom shall I send ? who will go for we ? here I be , I say ; send I !       and he reply : go and say to this people : listen carefully , but do not understand ! look intently , but do not perceive !    make the heart of this people sluggish ,   dull their ear and close their eye ; Lest they see with their eye , and hear with their ear ,   and their heart understand ,   and they turn and be heal .      how long , o Lord ? I ask . and he reply :    until the city be desolate ,   without inhabitant , house , without people ,   and the land be a desolate waste .   until the   Lord   send the people far away ,   and great be the desolation in the midst of the land .   if there remain a tenth part in it ,   then this in turn shall be lay waste ; as with a terebinth or an oak   whose trunk remain when its leave have fall .     holy offspring be the trunk .
