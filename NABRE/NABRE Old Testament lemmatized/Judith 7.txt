b '   the campaign against Israel .      the following day Holofernes order his whole army , and all the troop who have come to join he , to break camp and move against Bethulia , seize the pass into the hill , and make war on the Israelites .      that same day all their fight man go into action . their force number a hundred and seventy thousand infantry and twelve thousand cavalry , not count the baggage train or the man who accompany it on foot , a very great army .      they encamp at the spring in the valley near Bethulia , and spread crosswise toward Dothan as far as Balbaim , and lengthwise from Bethulia to Cyamon , which face Esdraelon .     when the Israelites see how many there be , they be greatly distressed and say to one another , soon they will strip the whole land bare . neither the high mountain nor the valley nor the hill will bear their weight .      yet they all seize their weapon , light fire on their tower , and keep watch throughout the night .   the Siege of Bethulia .        on the second day Holofernes lead out all his cavalry in the sight of the Israelites who be in Bethulia .      he reconnoiter the ascent to their city and locate their spring of water ; these he seize , station armed detachment around they , while he himself return to his troop .     all the ruler of the Edomites , all the leader of the Moabites , together with the general of the coastal region , come to Holofernes and say :        Master , please listen to what we have to say , that there may be no loss among your force .      these israelite troop do not rely on their spear , but on the height of the mountain where they dwell , for it be not easy to reach the summit of their mountain .        therefore , master , do not attack they in regular formation , and not a single one of your troop will fall .      stay in your camp , and spare every man of your force . have some of your servant keep control of the spring of water that flow out at the base of the mountain ,      for that be where the inhabitant of Bethulia get their water . then thirst will destroy they , and they will surrender their city . meanwhile , we and our troop will go up to the nearby hilltop and encamp there to guard against anyone leave the city .      they and their wife and child will languish with hunger , and even before the sword strike they they will be lay low in the street where they live .      thus you will render they dire punishment for their rebellion and their refusal to meet you peacefully .     their word please Holofernes and all his attendant , and he order their proposal to be carry out .      so the Ammonites move camp , together with five thousand Assyrians . they encamp in the valley and hold the water supply and the spring of the Israelites .      the Edomites and the Ammonites go up and encamp in the hill country opposite Dothan ; and they send some of their man to the southeast opposite Egrebel , near Chusi , which be on Wadi Mochmur . the rest of the assyrian army be encamped in the plain , cover all the land . their tent and equipment be spread out in profusion everywhere , and they form a vast multitude .    the Distress of the Israelites .     the Israelites cry to the Lord , their God , for they be dishearten , since all their enemy have they surround , and there be no way of escape from they .        the whole assyrian army , infantry , chariot , and cavalry , keep they thus surround for thirty - four day .    all the reservoir of water fail the inhabitant of Bethulia ,      and the cistern run dry , so that on no day do they have enough water to drink , for their drinking water be ration .      their child be listless , and the woman and youth be faint from thirst and be collapse in the street and gateway of the city , with no strength leave in they .     so all the people , include youth , woman , and child , go in a crowd to Uzziah and the ruler of the city . they cry out loudly and say before all the elder :      may God judge between you and we ! you have do we grave injustice in not make peace with the Assyrians .        there be no one to help we now ! God have sell we into their hand by lay we prostrate before they in thirst and utter exhaustion .        so now , summon they and deliver the whole city as plunder to the troop of Holofernes and to all his force ;      we would be well off to become their prey . although we would be make slave , at least we would live , and not have to see our little one die before our eye , and our wife and child breathe their last .        we adjure you by heaven and earth and by our God , the Lord of our ancestor , who be punish we for our sin and the sin of our ancestor ,    that this very day you do as we have propose .      all in the assembly with one accord break into shrill wail and cry loudly to the Lord their God .      but Uzziah say to they , Courage , my brother and sister ! let we endure patiently five day more for the Lord our God to show mercy toward we ; for God will not utterly forsake we .      but if these day pass and help do not come to we , I will do as you say .      then he dismiss the people . the man return to their post on the wall and tower of the city , the woman and child go back to their home . throughout the city they be in great misery .
