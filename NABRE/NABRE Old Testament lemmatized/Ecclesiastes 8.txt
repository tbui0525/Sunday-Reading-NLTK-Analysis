b '   critique of advice to Heed Authority    who be like the wise person ,   and who know the explanation of thing ? wisdom illumine the face   and transform a grim countenance .     observe the command of the king , in view of your oath to God .      be not hasty to withdraw from the king ; do not persist in an unpleasant situation , for he do whatever he please .      his word be sovereign , and who can say to he , what be you do ?       whoever observe a command know no harm , and the wise heart know time and judgment .       yes , there be a time and a judgment for everything . but it be a great evil for mortal       that they be ignorant of what be to come ; for who will make known to they how it will be ?      no one be master of the breath of life so as to retain it , and none have mastery of the day of death . there be no exemption in wartime , nor do wickedness deliver those who practice it .      all these thing I see and I apply my heart to every work that be do under the sun , while one person tyrannize over another for harm .    the Problem of Retribution .     meanwhile I see the wicked bury . they would come and go from the holy place . but those be forget in the city who have act justly . this also be vanity .        because the sentence against an evil deed be not promptly execute , the human heart be fill with the desire to commit evil\xe2\x80\x94       because the sinner do evil a hundred time and survive . though indeed I know that it shall be well with those who fear God , for their reverence toward he ;      and that it shall not be well with the wicked , who shall not prolong their shadowy day , for their lack of reverence toward God .     this be a vanity that occur on earth : there be those who be just but be treat as though they have do evil , and those who be wicked but be treat as though they have do justly . this , too , I say be vanity .       therefore I praise joy , because there be nothing well for mortal under the sun than to eat and to drink and to be joyful ; this will accompany they in their toil through the limited day of life God give they under the sun .     I apply my heart to know wisdom and to see the business that be do on earth , though neither by day nor by night do one eye see sleep ,       and I see all the work of God : no mortal can find out the work that be do under the sun . however much mortal may toil in search , no one find it out ; and even if the wise claim to know , they be unable to find it out .
