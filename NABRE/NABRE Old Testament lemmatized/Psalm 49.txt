b ' confidence in God rather than in Riches   for the leader . a psalm of the Korahites .      hear this , all you people !   give ear , all who inhabit the world ,   you of lowly birth or high estate ,   rich and poor together .   my mouth shall speak word of wisdom ,   my heart shall offer insight .    I will turn my ear to a riddle ,    expound my question on a lyre .    I   why should I fear in evil day ,   with the iniquity of my assailant surround I ,   of those who trust in their wealth   and boast of their abundant rich ?     no man can ransom even a brother ,   or pay to God his own ransom .    the redemption of his soul be costly ;   and he will pass away forever .   will he live on forever , then ,   and never see the Pit of corruption ?   indeed , he will see that the wise die ,   and the fool will perish together with the senseless ,    and they leave their wealth to other .    their tomb be their home forever ,   their dwelling through all generation ,   they name country after themselves    \xe2\x80\x94but man do not abide in splendor .   he be like the beasts\xe2\x80\x94they perish .     II   this be the way of those who trust in themselves ,   and the end of those who take pleasure in their own mouth . Selah   like a herd of sheep they will be put into Sheol ,   and Death will shepherd they . straight to the grave they descend ,   where their form will waste away ,   Sheol will be their palace .   but God will redeem my life ,   will take I    from the hand of Sheol .   Selah   do not fear when a man become rich ,   when the wealth of his house grow great .   at his death he will not take along anything ,   his glory will not go down after he .    during his life his soul utter blessing ;   they will praise you , for you do well for yourself .   but he will join the company of his father ,   never again to see the light .    in his prime , man do not understand .   he be like the beasts\xe2\x80\x94they perish .
