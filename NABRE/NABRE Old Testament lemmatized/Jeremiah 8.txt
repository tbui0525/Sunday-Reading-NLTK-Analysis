Israels Conduct Incomprehensible    tell they : thus say the   Lord : when someone fall , do they not rise again ?   if they turn away , do they not turn back ?   why then do these people resist   with persistent rebellion ? why do they cling to deception ,   refuse to turn back ?    I have listen closely :   they speak what be not true ; no one regret wickedness ,   say , what have I do ? everyone keep on run their course ,   like a horse dash into battle .    even the stork in the sky   know its season ; Turtledove , swift , and thrush   observe the time of their return , but my people do not know   the order of the   Lord .    how can you say , we be wise ,    we have the law of the   Lord ? see , that have be change into falsehood   by the lie pen of the scribe !    the wise be put to shame ,   terrify , and trap ; since they have reject the word of the   Lord ,   what sort of wisdom do they have ?     shameless in their crime   therefore , I will give their wife to other man ,   their field to new owner . small and great alike , all be greedy for gain ,   prophet and priest , all practice fraud .    they have treat lightly   the injury to the daughter of my people :   Peace , peace ! they say ,   though there be no peace .    they have act shamefully ; they have do abominable thing ,   yet they be not at all ashamed ,   they do not know how to blush . hence they shall be among those who fall ;   in their time of punishment they shall stumble ,   say the   Lord .     threat of punishment   I will gather they all in\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord :   no grape on the vine , no fig on the fig tree ,   foliage wither ! whatever I have give they be go .   why do we remain here ?   let we assemble and flee to the fortified city ,   where we will meet our doom ; for the   Lord   our God have doom we ,   he have give we poison water to drink ,   because we have sin against the   Lord .    we wait for peace to no avail ;   for a time of healing , but terror come instead .    from Dan be hear   the snorting of horse ; the neighing of stallion   shake the whole land . they come to devour the land and everything in it ,   the city and its inhabitant .   yes , I will send against you   poisonous snake . against they no charm will work   when they bite you\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord .     the Prophets grief over the Peoples suffer   my joy be go ,   grief be upon I ,   my heart be sick .   listen ! the cry of the daughter of my people ,   far and wide in the land ! be the   Lord   no long in Zion ,   be her King no long in her midst ? why do they provoke I with their idol ,   with their foreign nonentity ?    the harvest be over , the summer end ,   but we have not yet be save !
