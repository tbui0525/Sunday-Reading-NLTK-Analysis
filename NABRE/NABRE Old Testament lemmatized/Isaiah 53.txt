b '    who would believe what we have hear ?    to whom have the arm of the   Lord   be reveal ?    he grow up like a sapling before he ,    like a shoot from the parched earth ; he have no majestic bearing to catch our eye ,   no beauty to draw we to he .   he be spurn and avoid by man ,   a man of suffering , know pain , like one from whom you turn your face ,   spurn , and we hold he in no esteem .      yet it be our pain that he bear ,   our suffering he endure . we think of he as stricken ,   strike down by God    and afflict ,    but he be pierce for our sin ,   crush for our iniquity . he bear the punishment that make we whole ,   by his wound we be heal .    we have all go astray like sheep ,   all follow our own way ; but the   Lord   lay upon he    the guilt of we all .      though harshly treat , he submit   and do not open his mouth ; like a lamb lead to slaughter   or a sheep silent before shearer ,   he do not open his mouth .    seize and condemn , he be take away .   who would have think any more of his destiny ? for he be cut off from the land of the living ,   strike for the sin of his people .   he be give a grave among the wicked ,   a burial place with evildoer , though he have do no wrong ,   nor be deceit find in his mouth .    but it be the   Lord s will to crush he with pain . by make his life as a reparation offering ,    he shall see his offspring , shall lengthen his day ,   and the   Lord s will shall be accomplish through he .   because of his anguish he shall see the light ;   because of his knowledge he shall be content ; my servant , the just one , shall justify the many ,   their iniquity he shall bear .   therefore I will give he his portion among the many ,   and he shall divide the spoil with the mighty , because he surrender himself to death ,   be count among the transgressor , Bore the sin of many ,   and intercede for the transgressor .
