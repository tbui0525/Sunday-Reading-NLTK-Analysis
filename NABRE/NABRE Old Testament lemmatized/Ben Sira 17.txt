b '   Creation of Human Beings   the Lord create human being from the earth ,   and make they return to earth again .    a limited number of day he give they ,    but grant they authority over everything on earth .   he endow they with strength like his own ,   and make they in his image .   he put fear of they in all flesh ,   and give they dominion over beast and bird .    Discernment , tongue , and eye ,   ear , and a mind for think he give they .   with knowledge and understanding he fill they ;   good and evil he show they .   he put fear of he into their heart   to show they the grandeur of his work ,   that they might describe the wonder of his deed    and praise his holy name .   he set before they knowledge ,   and allot to they the law of life .   an everlasting covenant he make with they ,   and his commandment    he reveal to they .   his majestic glory their eye behold ,   his glorious voice their ear hear .   he say to they , avoid all evil ;   to each of they he give precept about their neighbor .   their way be ever know to he ,   they can not be hide from his eye .    over every nation he appoint a ruler ,    but Israel be the Lords own portion .     all their work be clear as the sun to he ,   and his eye be ever upon their way .   their iniquity can not be hide from he ;   all their sin be before the Lord .    human goodness be like a signet ring with God ,   and virtue he keep like the apple of his eye .   later he will rise up and repay they ,   requite each one as they deserve .     appeal for a return to God    but to the penitent he provide a way back   and encourage those who be lose hope !   turn back to the Lord and give up your sin ,   pray before he and make your offense few .   turn again to the most high and away from iniquity ,   and hate intensely what he loathe .    who in Sheol can glorify the most High    in place of the living who offer their praise ?   the dead can no more give praise than those who have never live ;   they who be alive and well glorify the Lord .   how great be the mercy of the Lord ,   and his forgiveness for those who return to he !   for not everything be within human reach ,   since human being be not immortal .   be anything bright than the sun ? yet it can be eclipse .   how worthless    then the thought of flesh and blood !   God hold accountable the host of high heaven ,   while all mortal be dust and ashe .             '
