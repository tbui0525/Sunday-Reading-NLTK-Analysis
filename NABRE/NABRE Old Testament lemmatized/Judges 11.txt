b '   Jephthah .     Jephthah    the Gileadite be a warrior . he be the son of a prostitute , father by Gilead .      gilead wife have also bear he son . when they grow up the son of the wife have drive Jephthah away , say to he , you shall inherit nothing in our father house , for you be the son of another woman .      so Jephthah have flee from his brother and take up residence in the land of Tob .    worthless man have join company with he , and go out with he on raid .      some time later , the Ammonites go to war with Israel .      as soon as the Ammonites be at war with Israel , the elder of Gilead go to bring Jephthah from the land of Tob .      come , they say to Jephthah , be our commander so that we can fight the Ammonites .      be you not the one who hate I and drive I from my father house ? Jephthah reply to the elder of Gilead , why do you come to I now , when you be in distress ?       the elder of Gilead say to Jephthah , this be the reason we have come back to you now : if you go with we to fight against the Ammonites , you shall be the leader of all of the inhabitant of Gilead .      Jephthah answer the elder of Gilead , if you bring I back to fight against the Ammonites and the   Lord   deliver they up to I , I will be your leader .      the elder of Gilead say to Jephthah , the   Lord   be witness between we that we will do as you say .      so Jephthah go with the elder of Gilead , and the army make he their leader and commander . Jephthah give all his order in the presence of the   Lord   in Mizpah .     then he send messenger to the king of the Ammonites to say , what do you have against I that you come to fight with I in my land ?      the king of the Ammonites answer the messenger of Jephthah , Israel take away my land from the Arnon to the Jabbok and the Jordan when they come up from Egypt .    now restore it peaceably .     again Jephthah send messenger to the king of the Ammonites ,      say to he , this be what Jephthah say : Israel do not take the land of Moab or the land of the Ammonites .        for when they come up from Egypt , Israel go through the wilderness to the Red Sea and come to Kadesh .      Israel then send messenger to the king of Edom say , let I pass through your land . but the king of Edom do not give consent .    they also send to the king of Moab , but he too be unwilling . so Israel remain in Kadesh .        then they go through the wilderness , and bypass the land of Edom and the land of Moab , they arrive east of the land of Moab and encamp across the Arnon .    thus they do not enter the territory of Moab , for the Arnon be the boundary of Moab .         then Israel send messenger to the Amorite king Sihon , who be king of Heshbon . Israel say to he , let I pass through your land to my own place .      but Sihon refuse to let Israel pass through his territory . he gather all his soldier , and they encamp at Jahaz and fight Israel .      but the   Lord , the God of Israel , deliver Sihon and his entire army into the power of Israel , who defeat they and occupy all the land of the Amorites who live in that region .      they occupy all of the Amorite territory from the Arnon to the Jabbok and the wilderness to the Jordan .        now , then , it be the   Lord , the God of Israel , who dispossess the Amorites for his people , Israel . and you be go to dispossess they ?      should you not take possession of that which your god Chemosh    give you to possess , and should we not take possession of all that the   Lord , our God , have dispossess for we ?      now , then , be you any well than Balak , son of Zippor , king of Moab ? do he ever quarrel with Israel or make war against they ?        Israel have dwelt in Heshbon and its village , Aroer and its village , and all the city on the bank of the Arnon for three hundred year .    why do you not recover they during that time ?      as for I , I have not sin against you , but you wrong I by make war against I . let the   Lord , who be judge , decide this day between the Israelites and the Ammonites !      but the king of the Ammonites pay no heed to the message Jephthah send he .    Jephthahs Vow .     the spirit of the   Lord   come upon Jephthah .    he pass through Gilead and Manasseh , and through Mizpah of Gilead as well , and from Mizpah of Gilead he cross over against the Ammonites .       Jephthah make a vow to the   Lord .    if you deliver the Ammonites into my power , he say ,      whoever come out of the door of my house to meet I when I return from the Ammonites in peace shall belong to the   Lord . I shall offer he up as a burn offering .     Jephthah then cross over against the Ammonites to fight against they , and the   Lord   deliver they into his power .      he inflict a very severe defeat on they from Aroer to the approach of Minnith\xe2\x80\x94twenty city in all\xe2\x80\x94and as far as Abel - keramin . so the Ammonites be bring into subjection by the Israelites .      when Jephthah return to his house in Mizpah , it be his daughter who come out to meet he , with tambourine - playing and dancing . she be his only child : he have neither son nor daughter besides she .      when he see she , he tear his garment and say , ah , my daughter ! you have strike I down and bring calamity upon I . for I have make a vow    to the   Lord   and I can not take it back .        Father , she reply , you have make a vow to the   Lord . do with I as you have vow , because the   Lord   have take vengeance for you against your enemy the Ammonites .      then she say to her father , let I have this favor . do nothing for two month , that I and my companion may go wander in the mountain to weep for my virginity .      go , he reply , and send she away for two month . so she depart with her companion and weep for her virginity in the mountain .      at the end of the two month she return to her father , and he do to she as he have vow . she have not have relation with any man . it become a custom in Israel      for israelite woman to go yearly to mourn the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite for four day of the year .
