b '   the ten Commandments .      then God speak all these word :      I be the   Lord   your God , who bring you out of the land of Egypt ,    out of the house of slavery .      you shall not have other god beside I .        you shall not make for yourself an idol    or a likeness of anything    in the heaven above or on the earth below or in the water beneath the earth ;      you shall not bow down before they or serve they .    for I , the   Lord , your God , be a jealous God , inflict punishment for their ancestor wickedness on the child of those who hate I , down to the third and fourth generation   ;      but show love down to the thousandth generation of those who love I and keep my commandment .     you shall not invoke the name of the   Lord , your God , in vain .     for the   Lord   will not leave unpunished anyone who invoke his name in vain .     remember the sabbath day\xe2\x80\x94keep it holy .        six day you may labor and do all your work ,      but the seventh day be a sabbath of the   Lord   your God .    you shall not do any work , either you , your son or your daughter , your male or female slave , your work animal , or the resident alien within your gate .      for in six day the   Lord   make the heavens and the earth , the sea and all that be in they ; but on the seventh day he rest .    that be why the   Lord   have bless the sabbath day and make it holy .        honor your father and your mother , that you may have a long life in the land the   Lord   your God be give you .      you shall not kill .       you shall not commit adultery .      you shall not steal .      you shall not bear false witness against your neighbor .      you shall not covet your neighbor house . you shall not covet your neighbor wife , his male or female slave , his ox or donkey , or anything that belong to your neighbor .     Moses Accepted as Mediator .     now as all the people witness the thunder and lightning , the blast of the shofar and the mountain smoking , they become afraid and tremble .    so they take up a position far away      and say to Moses , you speak to we , and we will listen ; but do not let God speak to we , or we shall die .      Moses answer the people , do not be afraid , for God have come only to test you and put the fear of he upon you so you do not sin .      so the people remain at a distance , while Moses approach the dark cloud where God be .    the Covenant Code .      the   Lord   say to Moses : this be what you will say to the Israelites : you have see for yourself that I have speak to you from heaven .      you shall not make alongside of I god of silver , nor shall you make for yourself god of gold .        an altar of earth make for I , and sacrifice upon it your burn offering and communion sacrifice , your sheep and your oxen .    in every place where I cause my name to be invoke    I will come to you and bless you .      but if you make an altar of stone for I ,    do not build it of cut stone , for by put a chisel to it you profane it .      you shall not ascend to my altar by step , lest your nakedness be expose .
