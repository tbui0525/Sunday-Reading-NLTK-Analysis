b ' God appoint the King both King and Priest   a psalm of David . the   Lord   say to my lord :    sit at my right hand ,   while I make your enemy your footstool .    the scepter of your might :   the   Lord   extend your strong scepter from Zion .   have dominion over your enemy !   yours be princely power from the day of your birth .   in holy splendor before the daystar ,   like dew I begot you .    the   Lord   have swear and will not waver :   you be a priest forever in the manner of Melchizedek .     at your right hand be the Lord ,   who crush king on the day of his wrath ,    who judge nation , heap up corpse ,   crush head across the wide earth ,    who drink from the brook by the wayside   and thus hold high his head .
