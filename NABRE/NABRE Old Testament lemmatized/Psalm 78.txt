b '   New Beginning in Zion and David     maskil   of saph . I ttend , my people , to my teaching ;   listen to the word of my mouth .   I will open my mouth in a parable ,    unfold the puzzle event of the past .    what we have hear and know ;   thing our ancestor have recount to we .    we do not keep they from our child ;   we recount they to the next generation , the praiseworthy deed of the   Lord   and his strength ,   the wonder that he perform .    God make a decree in Jacob ,   establish a law in Israel :   which he command our ancestor ,   they be to teach their child ;   that the next generation might come to know ,   child yet to be bear .   in turn they be to recount they to their child ,    that they too might put their confidence in God , nd not forget Gods deed ,   but keep his commandment .   they be not to be like their ancestor ,   a rebellious and defiant generation ,    generation whose heart be not constant ,    and whose spirit be not faithful to God .   the rank of Ephraimite archer ,    retreat on the day of battle .   they do not keep Gods covenant ;   they refuse to walk accord to his law .   they forget his deed ,   the wonder that he have show they .    II    in the sight of their ancestor God do wonder ,   in the land of Egypt , the plain of Zoan .     he split the sea and lead they across ,    make the water stand like wall .    he lead they with a cloud by day ,   all night with the light of fire .    he split rock in the desert ,   give water to drink , abundant as the deep of the sea .    he make stream flow from crag ,   cause river of water to flow down .    b   but they go on sin against he ,   rebel against the most high in the desert .    they test God in their heart ,   demand the food they crave .    they speak against God , and say ,   can God spread a table in the wilderness ?    true , when he strike the rock ,   water gush forth ,   the wadie flood . but can he also give bread ,   or provide meat to his people ?    C   the   Lord   hear and grow angry ;    fire blaze up against Jacob ;   anger flare up against Israel .   for they do not believe in God ,   do not trust in his saving power .    so he command the cloud above ;   and open the door of heaven .   God rain manna upon they for food ;   grain from heaven he give they .    Man eat the bread of the angel ;    food he send in abundance .   he stir up the east wind in the sky ;   by his might God bring on the south wind .   he rain meat upon they like dust ,   winged fowl like the sand of the sea ,   they fall down in the midst of their camp ,   all round their dwelling .   they eat and be well fill ;   he give they what they have crave .   but while they still want more ,   and the food be still in their mouth ,   Gods anger flare up against they ,   and he make a slaughter of their strong ,   lay low the youth of Israel .    in spite of all this they go on sin ,   they do not believe in his wonder .    D   God end their day abruptly ,   their year in sudden death .   when he slew they , they begin to seek he ;   they again look for God .    they remember    that God be their rock ,   God most High , their redeemer .   but they deceive he with their mouth ,   lie to he with their tongue .   their heart be not constant toward he ;   they be not faithful to his covenant .     but God be compassionate forgave their sin ;   he do not utterly destroy they . time and again he turn back his anger ,   unwilling to unleash all his rage .    he remember that they be flesh ,   a breath that pass on and do not return .    III    how often they rebel against God in the wilderness ,   grieve he in the wasteland .   gain and again they test God ,   provoke the Holy One of Israel .   they do not remember his power ,   the day he redeem they from the foe ,     when he perform his sign in Egypt ,   his wonder in the plain of Zoan .    God turn their river to blood ;   their stream they could not drink .   he send swarm of insect that devour they ,    frog that destroy they .   he give their harvest to the caterpillar ,   the fruit of their labor to the locust .   he kill their vine with hail ,    their sycamore with frost .   he expose their cattle to plague ,   their flock to pestilence .    he let loose against they the heat of his anger ,   wrath , fury , and distress ,   a band of deadly messenger .   he clear a path for his anger ;   he do not spare they from death ,   but deliver their animal to the plague .   he strike all the firstborn of Egypt ,    the first fruit of their vigor in the tent of Ham .   then God lead forth his people like sheep ,   guide they like a flock through the wilderness .    he lead they on secure and unafraid ,   while the sea envelop their enemy .    nd he bring they to his holy mountain ,   the hill his right hand have win .    he drive out the nation before they ,   allot they as their inherit portion ,   and settle in their tent the tribe of Israel .    b   but they test and rebel against God most High ,   his decree they do not observe .   they turn disloyal , faithless like their ancestor ;   they prove false like a slack bow .   they enrage he with their high place ,   and with their idol provoke he    to jealous anger .     C   God hear and grow angry ;   he reject Israel completely .   he forsake the shrine at Shiloh ,     the tent he set up among human being .   he give up his might into captivity ,   his glorious ark into the hand of the foe .    God deliver his people to the sword ;   he be enrage against his heritage .   Fire consume their young man ;   their young woman hear no wedding song .    their priest fall by the sword ;   their widow make no lamentation .    D   then the Lord awake as from sleep ,   like a warrior shout from the effect of wine .   he put his foe to flight ;   everlaste shame he deal they .   he reject the tent of Joseph ,   choose not the tribe of Ephraim .    God choose the tribe of Judah ,   Mount Zion which he love .    he build his shrine like the heavens ,   like the earth which he found forever .   he choose David his servant ,   take he from the sheepfold .    from tend ewe God bring he ,   to shepherd Jacob , his people ,   Israel , his heritage .    he shepherd they with a pure heart ;   with skilled hand he guide they .
