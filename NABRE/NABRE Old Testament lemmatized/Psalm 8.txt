b ' Divine Majesty and Human Dignity   for the leader ; upon the   gittith .    a psalm of David .     o   Lord , our Lord ,   how awesome be your name through all the earth !    I will sing of your majesty above the heaven    with the mouth of babe    and infant .   you have establish a bulwark against your foe ,   to silence enemy and avenger .     when I see your heaven , the work of your finger ,   the moon and star that you set in place\xe2\x80\x94    what be man that you be mindful of he ,    and a son of man that you care for he ?    yet you have make he little less than a god ,    crown he with glory and honor .   you have give he rule over the work of your hand ,    put all thing at his foot :   all sheep and oxen ,   even the beast of the field ,   the bird of the air , the fish of the sea ,   and whatever swim the path of the sea .     o   Lord , our Lord ,   how awesome be your name through all the earth !
