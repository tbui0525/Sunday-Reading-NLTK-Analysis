b '   Abram and Lot Part .     from Egypt Abram go up to the Negeb with his wife and all that belong to he , and Lot go with he .         now Abram be very rich in livestock , silver , and gold .        from the Negeb he travel by stage toward Bethel , to the place between Bethel and Ai where his tent have formerly stand ,      the site where he have first build the altar ; and there Abram invoke the   Lord   by name .      Lot , who go with Abram , also have flock and herd and tent ,      so that the land could not support they if they stay together ; their possession be so great that they could not live together .      there be quarrel between the herder of Abrams livestock and the herder of lot livestock . at this time the Canaanites and the Perizzites be live in the land .     so Abram say to Lot : let there be no strife between you and I , or between your herder and my herder , for we be kindred .      be not the whole land available ? please separate from I . if you prefer the left , I will go to the right ; if you prefer the right , I will go to the left .      Lot look about and see how abundantly water the whole Jordan Plain be as far as Zoar , like the   Lord s own garden , or like Egypt . this be before the   Lord   have destroy Sodom and Gomorrah .      Lot , therefore , choose for himself the whole Jordan Plain and set out eastward . thus they separate from each other .      Abram settle in the land of Canaan , while Lot settle among the city of the Plain , pitch his tent near Sodom .      now the inhabitant of Sodom be wicked , great sinner against the   Lord .      after Lot have part from he , the   Lord   say to Abram : look about you , and from where you be , gaze to the north and south , east and west ;        all the land that you see I will give to you and your descendant forever .        I will make your descendant like the dust of the earth ; if anyone could count the dust of the earth , your descendant too might be count .        get up and walk through the land , across its length and breadth , for I give it to you .      Abram move his tent and go on to settle near the oak of Mamre , which be at Hebron . there he build an altar to the   Lord .              '
