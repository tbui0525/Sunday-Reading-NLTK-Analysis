b '   Sickness and Death   make friend with the doctor , for he be essential to you ;    God have also establish he in his profession .   from God the doctor have wisdom ,   and from the king he receive sustenance .   Knowledge make the doctor distinguish ,   and give access to those in authority .   God make the earth yield heal herb   which the prudent should not neglect ;   be not the water sweeten by a twig ,   so that all might learn his power ?    he endow people with knowledge ,   to glory in his mighty work ,   through which the doctor ease pain ,    and the druggist prepare his medicine . thus Gods work continue without cease   in its efficacy on the surface of the earth .     my son , when you be ill , do not delay ,   but pray to God , for it be he who heal .    Flee wickedness and purify your hand ;   cleanse your heart of every sin .   offer your sweet - smell oblation and memorial ,   a generous offering accord to your mean .    then give the doctor his place   lest he leave ; you need he too ,   for there be time when recovery be in his hand .    he too pray to God that his diagnosis may be correct   and his treatment bring about a cure .   whoever be a sinner before his maker   will be defiant toward the doctor .     my son , shed tear for one who be dead    with wail and bitter lament ; as be only proper , prepare the body ,   and do not absent yourself from the burial .   weep bitterly , mourn fully ,   pay your tribute of sorrow , as deserve : a day or two , to prevent gossip ;   then compose yourself after your grief .   for grief can bring on death ,   and heartache can sap one strength .    when a person be carry away , sorrow be over ;   and the life of the poor one be grievous to the heart .   do not turn your thought to he again ;   cease to recall he ; think rather of the end .    do not recall he , for there be no hope of his return ;   you do he no good , and you harm yourself .    remember that his fate will also be your ;   for he it be yesterday , for you today .    with the dead at rest , let memory cease ;   be console , once the spirit have go .    vocation of the Skilled Worker and the Scribe    the scribe wisdom increase wisdom ;   whoever be free from toil can become wise .   how can one become learn who guide the plow ,   and thrill in wield the goad like a lance , who guide the ox and urge on the bullock ,   and whose every concern be for cattle ?   his concern be to plow furrow ,   and he be careful to fatten the livestock .     so with every engraver and designer   who , labor night and day , fashion carve seal ,   and whose concern be to vary the pattern . his determination be to produce a lifelike impression ,   and he be careful to finish the work .     so too the smith sit by the anvil ,   intent on the iron he forge . the flame from the fire sear his flesh ,   yet he toil away in the furnace heat . the clang of the hammer deafen his ear ;   his eye be on the object he be shape . his determination be to finish the work ,   and he be careful to perfect it in detail .     so also the potter sit at his labor ,   revolve the wheel with his foot . he be always concerned for his product ,   and turn they out in quantity .   with his hand he mold the clay ,   and with his foot soften it . his determination be to complete the glazing ,   and he be careful to fire the kiln .     all these be skilled with their hand ,   each one an expert at his own work ;   without they no city could be live in ,   and wherever they stay , they do not go hungry . but they be not seek out for the council of the people ,    nor be they prominent in the assembly . they do not sit on the judge bench ,   nor can they understand law and justice . they can not expound discipline or judgment ,   nor be they find among the ruler .   yet they maintain the fabric of the world ,   and their concern be for exercise of their skill .
