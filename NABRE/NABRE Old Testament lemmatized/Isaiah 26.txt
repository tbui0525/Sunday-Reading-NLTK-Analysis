b '   Judahs praise and Prayer for Deliverance .      on that day this song shall be sing in the land of Judah : a strong city    have we ;   he set up victory as our wall and rampart .    open up the gate   that a righteous nation may enter ,   one that keep faith .    with firm purpose you maintain peace ;   in peace , because of our trust in you .    Trust in the   Lord   forever !   for the   Lord   be an eternal Rock .    he humble those who dwell on high ,   the lofty city he bring down , bring it down to the ground ,   level it to the dust .    the foot of the needy trample on it\xe2\x80\x94   the foot of the poor .   the way of the just be smooth ;   the path of the just you make level .    the course of your judgment ,   Lord , we await ;   your name and your memory be the desire of our soul .   my soul yearn for you at night ,   yes , my spirit within I seek you at dawn ; when your judgment come upon the earth ,   the world inhabitant learn justice .    the wicked , when spare , do not learn justice ;   in an upright land they act perversely ,   and do not see the majesty of the   Lord .    Lord , your hand be raise high ,   but they do not perceive it ; let they be put to shame when they see your zeal for your people :   let the fire prepare for your enemy consume they .    Lord , you will decree peace for we ,   for you have accomplish all we have do .    Lord , our God , lord other than you have rule we ;   only because of you can we call upon your name .   dead they be , they can not live ,   shade that can not rise ; indeed , you have punish and destroy they ,   and wipe out all memory of they .   you have increase the nation ,   Lord ,   you have increase the nation , have add to your glory ,   you have extend far all the boundary of the land .    Lord , oppress by your punishment ,   we cry out in anguish under your discipline .    as a woman about to give birth   writhe and cry out in pain ,   so be we before you ,   Lord .    we conceive and writhe in pain ,   give birth only to wind ; Salvation we have not achieve for the earth ,   no inhabitant for the world be bear .     but your dead shall live , their corpse shall rise !   Awake and sing , you who lie in the dust ! for your dew be a dew of light ,   and you cause the land of shade to give birth .     the Lords Response    go , my people , enter your chamber ,   and close the door behind you ; hide yourself for a brief moment ,   until the wrath be past .    see , the   Lord   go forth from his place ,   to punish the wickedness of the earth inhabitant ; the earth will reveal the blood shed upon it ,   and no long conceal the slay .
