b '   the Enemy at the Gates   seek refuge , Benjaminites ,   from the midst of Jerusalem ! blow the trumpet in Tekoa ,   raise a signal over Beth - haccherem ; for disaster threaten from the north ,   and mighty destruction .    lovely and delicate   daughter Zion , you be ruin !   against she , shepherd come with their flock ;    all around , they pitch their tent against she ;   each one graze his portion .    prepare for war against she ,   up ! let we rush upon she at midday ! woe to we ! the day be wane ,   evening shadow lengthen !   up ! let we rush upon she by night ,   destroy her palace !     for thus say the   Lord   of host : Hew down her tree ,   throw up a siege mound against Jerusalem . woe to the city mark for punishment ;   there be nothing but oppression within she !    as a well keep its water fresh ,   so she keep fresh her wickedness . violence and destruction resound in she ;   ever before I be wound and blow .    be warn , Jerusalem ,   or I will be estranged from you , and I will turn you into a wilderness ,   a land where no one dwell .    thus say the   Lord   of host : Glean , glean like a vine   the remnant of Israel ; pass your hand , like a vintager ,   repeatedly over the tendril .   to whom shall I speak ?   whom shall I warn , and be hear ? see ! their ear be uncircumcised ,   they can not pay attention ; see , the word of the   Lord   have become for they   an object of scorn , for which they have no taste .    but the wrath of the   Lord   brim up within I ,   I be weary of hold it in . I will pour it out upon the child in the street ,   upon the young man gather together . yes , husband and wife will be take ,   elder with ancient .    their house will fall to other ,   their field and their wife as well ; for I will stretch forth my hand   against those who dwell in the land\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord .    small and great alike , all be greedy for gain ;   prophet and priest , all practice fraud .    they have treat lightly   the injury to my people : Peace , peace ! they say ,   though there be no peace .    they have act shamefully , commit abomination ,   yet they be not at all ashamed ,   they do not know how to blush . therefore they will fall among the fallen ;   in the time of their punishment they shall stumble ,   say the   Lord .     thus say the   Lord : stand by the early road ,   ask the pathway of old ,   which be the way to good ? and walk it ;   thus you will find rest for yourself .   but they say , we will not walk it .    I raise up watchman    for they :   pay attention to the sound of the trumpet !   but they say , we will not pay attention !   therefore hear , o nation ,   and know , o earth ,   what I will do with they :   see , I bring evil upon this people ,   the fruit of their own scheme , because they do not pay attention to my word ,   because they reject my law .    of what use to I be incense that come from Sheba ,   or sweet cane from far - off land ? your burn offering find no favor with I ,   your sacrifice do not please I .     therefore , thus say the   Lord : see , I will place before this people   obstacle to trip they up ; parent and child alike ,   neighbor and friend shall perish .     thus say the   Lord : see , a people come from the land of the north ,   a great nation , rise from the very end of the earth .    bow and javelin they wield ;   cruel and pitiless be they . they sound like the roar sea   as they ride forth on horse , each in his place for battle   against you , daughter Zion .   we hear news of they ;   our hand hang helpless , Anguish take hold of we ,   pang like a woman in childbirth .    do not go out into the field ,   do not step into the street , for the enemy have a sword ;   terror on every side !   Daughter of my people , dress in sackcloth ,   roll in the ashe . Mourn as for an only child   with bitter wailing : how suddenly the destroyer   come upon we !     a tester for my people I have appoint you ,   to search and test their way .    arch - rebel be they all ,   dealer in slander , bronze and iron , all of they ,   destroyer they be .   the bellow be scorch ,   the lead be consume by the fire ; in vain have the refiner refine ,   the wicked be not draw off .   silver reject they shall be call ,   for the   Lord   have reject they .
