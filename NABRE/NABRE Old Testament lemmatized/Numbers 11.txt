b '   Discontent of the People .     now the people complain bitterly in the hearing of the   Lord ;    and when he hear it his wrath flare up , so that the   Lord s fire burn among they and consume the outskirt of the camp .      but when the people cry out to Moses , he pray to the   Lord   and the fire die out .      hence that place be call Taberah ,    because there the fire of the   Lord   burn among they .     the riffraff among they be so greedy for meat that even the Israelites lament again ,    if only we have meat for food !      we remember the fish we use to eat without cost in Egypt , and the cucumber , the melon , the leek , the onion , and the garlic .      but now we be famish ; we have nothing to look forward to but this manna .       Manna be like coriander seed    and have the appearance of bdellium .      when they have go about and gather it up , the people would grind it between millstone or pound it in a mortar , then cook it in a pot and make it into loaf , with a rich creamy taste .      at night , when the dew fall upon the camp , the manna also fall .      when Moses hear the people , family after family , cry at the entrance of their tent , so that the   Lord   become very angry , he be grieve .      why do you treat your servant so badly ? Moses ask the   Lord . why be you so displeased with I that you burden I with all this people ?      be it I who conceive all this people ? or be it I who give they birth , that you tell I to carry they at my breast , like a nurse carry an infant , to the land you have promise under oath to their father ?      where can I get meat to give to all this people ? for they be cry to I , give we meat for our food .      I can not carry all this people by myself , for they be too heavy for I .      if this be the way you will deal with I , then please do I the favor of kill I at once , so that I need no long face my distress .    the Seventy Elders .     then the   Lord   say to Moses : assemble for I seventy of the elder of Israel , whom you know to be elder and authority among the people , and bring they to the tent of meeting . when they be in place beside you ,      I will come down and speak with you there . I will also take some of the spirit that be on you and will confer it on they , that they may share the burden of the people with you . you will then not have to bear it by yourself .     to the people , however , you shall say : sanctify yourself for tomorrow , when you shall have meat to eat . for in the hearing of the   Lord   you have cry , if only we have meat for food ! oh , how well off we be in Egypt ! therefore the   Lord   will give you meat to eat ,      and you will eat it , not for one day , or two day , or five , or ten , or twenty day ,      but for a whole month\xe2\x80\x94until it come out of your very nostril and become loathsome to you . for you have reject the   Lord   who be in your midst , and in his presence you have cry , why do we ever leave Egypt ?     but Moses say , the people around I include six hundred thousand soldier ; yet you say , I will give they meat to eat for a whole month .      can enough sheep and cattle be slaughter for they ? if all the fish of the sea be catch for they , would they have enough ?      the   Lord   answer Moses : be this beyond the   Lord s reach ? you shall see now whether or not what I have say to you take place .    the Spirit on the Elders .     so Moses go out and tell the people what the   Lord   have say . gather seventy elder of the people , he have they stand around the tent .      the   Lord   then come down in the cloud and speak to he . take some of the spirit that be on Moses , he bestow it on the seventy elder ; and as the spirit come to rest on they , they prophesy    but do not continue .     now two man , one name Eldad and the other Medad , have remain in the camp , yet the spirit come to rest on they also . they too have be on the list , but have not go out to the tent ; and so they prophesy in the camp .      so , when a young man run and report to Moses , Eldad and Medad be prophesy in the camp ,      Joshua , son of Nun , who from his youth have be Moses aide , say , my lord , Moses , stop they .      but Moses answer he , be you jealous for my sake ? if only all the people of the   Lord   be prophet ! if only the   Lord   would bestow his spirit on they !      then Moses retire to the camp , along with the elder of Israel .    the Quail .     there arise a wind    from the   Lord   that drive in quail from the sea and leave they all around the camp site , to a distance of a day journey and at a depth of two cubit upon the ground .         so all that day , all night , and all the next day the people set about to gather in the quail . even the one who get the least gather ten homer    of they . then they spread they out all around the camp .      but while the meat be still between their tooth , before it could be chew , the   Lord s wrath flare up against the people , and the   Lord   strike they with a very great plague .      so that place be name Kibroth - hattaavah ,    because it be there that the greedy people be bury .     from Kibroth - hattaavah the people set out for Hazeroth , where they stay .
