b '    plan be make in human heart ,   but from the   Lord   come the tongue response .    all one way be pure    in one own eye ,   but the measurer of motive be the   Lord .    entrust your work to the   Lord ,   and your plan will succeed .   the   Lord   have make everything for a purpose ,   even the wicked for the evil day .    every proud heart    be an abomination to the   Lord ;    be assure that none will go unpunished .   by steadfast loyalty guilt be expiate ,   and by the fear of the   Lord   evil be avoid .    when the   Lord   be pleased with someone way ,   he make even enemy be at peace with they .   well a little with justice ,   than a large income with injustice .   the human heart plan the way ,   but the   Lord   direct the step .     an oracle be upon the king lip ,   no judgment of his mouth be false .    balance and scale belong to the   Lord ;   every weight in the sack be his concern .    Wrongdoing be an abomination to king ,   for by justice the throne endure .    the king take delight in honest lip ,   and whoever speak what be right he love .    the king wrath be a messenger of death ,    but a wise person can pacify it .   a king smile mean life ,   and his favor be like a rain cloud in spring .    how much well to get wisdom than gold !   to get understanding be preferable to silver .     the path of the upright lead away from misfortune ;   those who attend to their way guard their life .    Pride go before disaster ,   and a haughty spirit before a fall .   it be well to be humble with the poor   than to share plunder with the proud .    whoever ponder a matter will be successful ;   happy the one who trust in the   Lord !   the wise of heart be esteemed for discernment ,   and pleasing speech gain a reputation for learn .   good sense be a fountain of life to those who have it ,   but folly be the training of fool .   the heart of the wise make for eloquent speech ,   and increase the learning on their lip .   please word be a honeycomb ,   sweet to the taste and invigorate to the bone .   sometimes a way seem right ,   but the end of it lead to death !    the appetite of worker work for they ,   for their mouth urge they on .     scoundrel be a furnace of evil ,   and their lip be like a scorching fire .   perverse speech sow discord ,   and talebeare separate bosom friend .    the violent deceive their neighbor ,   and lead they into a way that be not good .   whoever wink an eye plan perversity ;   whoever purse the lip do evil .    Gray hair be a crown of glory ;    it be gain by a life that be just .   the patient be well than warrior ,   and those who rule their temper , well than the conqueror of a city .    into the bag the lot be cast ,   but from the   Lord   come every decision .
