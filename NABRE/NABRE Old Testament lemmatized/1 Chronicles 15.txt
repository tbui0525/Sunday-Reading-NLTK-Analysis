David build house for himself in the City of David and prepare a place for the ark of God , pitch a tent for it there .      at that time he say , no one may carry the ark of God except the Levites , for the   Lord   choose they to carry the ark of the   Lord   and to minister to he forever .        then David assemble all Israel to Jerusalem to bring up the ark of the   Lord   to its place , which he have prepare for it .        David also convene the son of Aaron and the Levites :      of the son of Kohath , Uriel , their chief , and one hundred and twenty of his brother ;      of the son of Merari , Asaiah , their chief , and two hundred and twenty of his brother ;      of the son of Gershon , Joel , their chief , and one hundred and thirty of his brother ;      of the son of Elizaphan , Shemaiah , their chief , and two hundred of his brother ;      of the son of Hebron , Eliel , their chief , and eighty of his brother ;      of the son of Uzziel , Amminadab , their chief , and one hundred and twelve of his brother .     David summon the priest Zadok and Abiathar , and the Levites Uriel , Asaiah , Joel , Shemaiah , Eliel , and Amminadab ,        and say to they : you head of the levitical house , sanctify yourself along with your brother to bring up the ark of the   Lord , the God of Israel , to the place which I have prepare for it .        because you be not with we the first time , the   Lord   our God break out against we , for we do not seek he aright .        accordingly , the priest and the Levites sanctify themselves to bring up the ark of the   Lord , the God of Israel .      the Levites carry the ark of God on their shoulder with pole , as Moses have command accord to the word of the   Lord .      David command the commander of the Levites to appoint their brother as singer and to play on musical instrument , harp , lyre , and cymbal , to make a loud sound of rejoicing .        therefore the Levites appoint Heman , son of Joel , and , among his brother , Asaph , son of Berechiah ; and among the son of Merari , their brother , Ethan , son of Kushaiah ;        and , together with these , their brother of the second rank : the gatekeeper Zechariah , Uzziel , Shemiramoth , Jehiel , Unni , Eliab , Benaiah , Maaseiah , Mattithiah , Eliphelehu , Mikneiah , Obed - edom , and Jeiel .      the singer , Heman , Asaph , and Ethan , sound brass cymbal .      Zechariah , Uzziel , Shemiramoth , Jehiel , Unni , Eliab , Maaseiah , and Benaiah play on harp set to Alamoth .        but Mattithiah , Eliphelehu , Mikneiah , Obed - edom , and Jeiel lead the song on lyre set to sheminith .      Chenaniah be the chief of the Levites in the singing ; he direct the singing , for he be skillful .        Berechiah and Elkanah be gatekeeper before the ark .      the priest , Shebaniah , Joshaphat , Nethanel , Amasai , Zechariah , Benaiah , and Eliezer , sound the trumpet before the ark of God .

David be vest in a robe of fine linen , as be all the Levites who carry the ark , the singer , and Chenaniah , the leader of song ; David be also wear a linen ephod .        thus all Israel bring up the ark of the covenant of the   Lord   with joyful shouting , to the sound of horn , trumpet , and cymbal , and the music of harp and lyre .      but as the ark of the covenant of the   Lord   be enter the City of David , Michal , daughter of Saul , look down from her window , and when she see King David leap and dancing , she despise he in her heart .
