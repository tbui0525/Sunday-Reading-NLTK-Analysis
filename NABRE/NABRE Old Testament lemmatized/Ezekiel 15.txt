b '   parable of the Vine .      the word of the   Lord   come to I :     Son of man ,   what make the wood of the vine well than the wood of branch   find on the tree in the forest ?    can wood be take from it   to make something useful ? can someone make even a peg out of it   on which to hang a vessel ?   of course not ! if it be feed to the fire for fuel ,   and the fire devour both end of it , leave the middle char ,   be it useful for anything then ?   even when it be whole   it can not be use for anything ; so when fire have devour and char it ,   how useful can it be ?   therefore , thus say the Lord   God : like vine wood among forest tree ,   which I have give as fuel for fire , so I will give the inhabitant of Jerusalem .   I will set my face against they : although they have escape the fire ,   the fire will still devour they ; you shall know that I be the   Lord ,   when I set my face against they .    yes , I will make the land desolate ,   because they be so unfaithful\xe2\x80\x94   oracle of the Lord   God .
