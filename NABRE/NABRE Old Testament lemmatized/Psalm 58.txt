II   the wicked have be corrupt since birth ;   liar from the womb , they have go astray .    their venom be like the venom of a snake ,   like that of a serpent stop its ear ,    so as not to hear the voice of the charmer   or the enchanter with cunning spell .    III   O God , smash the tooth in their mouth ;   break the fang of these lion ,   Lord !    make they vanish like water flow away ;    tread down , let they wither like grass .    let they dissolve like a snail that ooze away ,    like an untimely birth that never see the sun .    suddenly , like bramble or thistle ,   have the whirlwind snatch they away .    then the just shall rejoice to see the vengeance   and bathe their foot in the blood of the wicked .    then people will say :   truly there be a reward for the just ;   there be a God who be judge on earth !
