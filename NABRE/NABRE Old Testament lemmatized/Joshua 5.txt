b '   rite at Gilgal .     when all the king of the Amorites to the west of the Jordan and all the king of the Canaanites by the sea hear that the   Lord   have dry up the water of the Jordan before the Israelites until they cross over , their heart melt and they be utterly dispirited because of the Israelites .      on this occasion the   Lord   say to Joshua : make flint knife and circumcise Israel for the second time .      so Joshua make flint knife and circumcise the Israelites at Gibeath - haaraloth .        this be the reason for the circumcision : of all the people who have come out of Egypt , every male of military age have die in the wilderness    during the journey after they come out of Egypt .      though all the man who come out be circumcise , none of those bear in the wilderness during the journey after the departure from Egypt be circumcise .      now the Israelites wander forty year in the wilderness , until all the warrior among the people that come forth from Egypt die off because they have not listen to the voice of the   Lord . for the   Lord   swear    that he would not let they see the land he have swear to their ancestor to give we , a land flow with milk and honey .       it be the child God raise up in their stead whom Joshua circumcise , for these be yet with foreskin , not having be circumcise on the journey .      when the circumcision of the entire nation be complete , they remain in camp where they be , until they recover .      then the   Lord   say to Joshua : today I have remove the reproach of Egypt from you .    therefore the place be call Gilgal    to the present day .      while the Israelites be encamped at Gilgal on the plain of Jericho , they celebrate the Passover on the evening of the fourteenth day of the month .        on the day after the Passover they eat of the produce of the land in the form of unleavened cake and parch grain . on that same day      after they eat of the produce of the land , the manna cease . no long be there manna for the Israelites , who that year eat of the yield of the land of Canaan .     siege at Jericho .      while Joshua be near Jericho , he raise his eye and see one who stand face he , draw sword in hand .    Joshua go up to he and ask , be you one of we or one of our enemy ?      he reply , neither . I be the commander    of the army of the   Lord : now I have come . then Joshua fall down to the ground in worship , and say to he , what have my lord to say to his servant ?      the commander of the army of the   Lord   reply to Joshua , remove your sandal from your foot , for the place on which you be stand be holy .    and Joshua do so .
