b '    the just have perish ,   but no one take it to heart ; the steadfast be sweep away ,   while no one understand . yet the just be take away from the presence of evil ,     and enter into peace ; they rest upon their couch ,   the sincere , who walk in integrity .     an Idolatrous People    but you , draw near ,   you child of a sorceress ,   offspring of an adulterer and a prostitute !    against whom do you make sport ,   against whom do you open wide your mouth ,   and stick out your tongue ? be you not rebellious child ,   deceitful offspring\xe2\x80\x94   you who burn with lust among the oak ,   under every green tree ; you who immolate child in the wadie ,   among the cleft of the rock ?     among the smooth stone    of the wadi be your portion ,   they , they be your allotment ; indeed , you pour out a drink offering to they ,   and bring up grain offering .   with these thing , should I be appease ?   upon a towering and lofty mountain   you set up your bed ,   and there you go up to offer sacrifice .    behind the door and the doorpost   you set up your symbol . yes , desert I , you carry up your bedding ;   and spread it wide . you enter an agreement with they ,   you love their couch , you gaze upon nakedness .    you approach the king    with oil ,   and multiply your perfume ; you send your ambassador far away ,   down even to deep Sheol .   though wear out with the length of your journey ,   you never say , it be hopeless ; you find your strength revive ,   and so you do not weaken .   whom do you dread and fear ,   that you tell lie , and I you do not remember   nor take to heart ? be I to keep silent and conceal ,   while you show no fear of I ?   I will proclaim your justice    and your work ;   but they shall not help you .    when you cry out ,   let your collection of idol save you . all these the wind shall carry off ,   a mere breath shall bear they away ; but whoever take refuge in I shall inherit the land ,   and possess my holy mountain .    the Way to Peace for Gods People   and I say : build up , build up , prepare the way ,   remove every obstacle from my people way .      for thus say the high and lofty one ,   the one who dwell forever , whose name be holy : I dwell in a high and holy place ,   but also with the contrite and lowly of spirit , to revive the spirit of the lowly ,   to revive the heart of the crush .   for I will not accuse forever ,   nor always be angry ; for without I their spirit fail ,   the life breath that I have give .    because of their wicked avarice I grow angry ;   I strike they , hide myself from they in wrath . but they turn back , follow the way   of their own heart .    I see their way ,   but I will heal they . I will lead they and restore full comfort to they   and to those who mourn for they ,     create word of comfort .   Peace ! peace to those who be far and near ,   say the   Lord ; and I will heal they .   but the wicked be like the toss sea   which can not be still , its water cast up mire and mud .     there be no peace for the wicked !   say my God .
