b '    Nehemiah Hears Bad News .      the word of Nehemiah , son of Hacaliah . in the month Kislev of the twentieth year , I be in the citadel of Susa      when Hanani , one of my brother , come with other man from Judah . I ask they about the Jews , the remnant preserve after the captivity , and about Jerusalem .      they answer I : the survivor of the captivity there in the province be in great distress and under reproach . the wall of Jerusalem have be breach , its gate gutte by fire .      when I hear this report , I begin to weep and continue mourning for several day , fast and pray before the God of heaven .       I pray :   Lord , God of heaven , great and awesome God , you preserve your covenant of mercy with those who love you and keep your commandment .       may your ear be attentive , and your eye open , to hear the prayer that I , your servant , now offer in your presence day and night for your servant the Israelites , confess the sin we have commit against you , I and my ancestral house include .       we have greatly offend you , not keep the commandment , the statute , and the ordinance you entrust to your servant Moses .       but remember the admonition which you address to Moses , your servant , when you say : if you prove faithless , I will scatter you among the people ;      but if you return to I and carefully keep my commandment , even though your outcast have be drive to the farth corner of the world , I will gather they from there , and bring they back to the place I have choose as the dwelling place for my name .       they be your servant , your people , whom you free by your great might and strong hand .       Lord , may your ear be attentive to the prayer of your servant and that of all your servant who willingly revere your name . Grant success to your servant this day , and let he find favor with this man\xe2\x80\x94for I be cupbearer to the king .              '
