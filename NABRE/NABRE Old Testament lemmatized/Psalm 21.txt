I   Lord , the king find joy in your power ;    in your victory how greatly he rejoice !   you have grant he his heart desire ;   you do not refuse the request of his lip . Selah   for you welcome he with goodly blessing ;   you place on his head a crown of pure gold .   he ask life of you ;   you give it to he ,   length of day forever .    great be his glory in your victory ;   majesty and splendor you confer upon he .   you make he the pattern of blessing forever ,   you gladden he with the joy of your face .   for the king trust in the   Lord ,   stand firm through the mercy of the most high .    II   your hand will find all your enemy ;   your right hand will find your foe !   at the time of your come   you will make they a fiery furnace . then the   Lord   in his anger will consume they ,   devour they with fire .   even their descendant you will wipe out from the earth ,   their offspring from the human race .   though they intend evil against you ,   devise plot , they will not succeed ,   for you will put they to flight ;   you will aim at their face with your bow .    III   Arise ,   Lord , in your power !    we will sing and chant the praise of your might .             '
