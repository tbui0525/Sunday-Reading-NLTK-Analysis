b '   those who be worthy of praise    with three thing I be delighted ,   for they be pleasing to the Lord and to human being : Harmony among relative , friendship among neighbor ,   and a wife and a husband live happily together .   three kind of people I hate ,   and I loathe their manner of life : a proud pauper , a rich liar ,   and a lecherous old fool .     in your youth you do not gather .   how will you find anything in your old age ?   how appropriate be sound judgment in the gray - haired ,   and good counsel in the elderly !   how appropriate be wisdom in the aged ,   understanding and counsel in the venerable !   the crown of the elderly , wide experience ;   their glory , the fear of the Lord .     there be nine who come to mind as bless ,   a tenth whom my tongue proclaim :   the man who find joy in his child ,   and the one who live to see the downfall of his enemy .   happy the man who live with a sensible woman ,   and the one who do not plow with an ox and a donkey combine .   happy the one who do not sin with the tongue ,   who do not serve an inferior .   happy the one who find a friend ,   who speak to attentive ear .   how great be the one who find wisdom ,   but none be great than the one who fear the Lord .   fear of the Lord surpass all else .   to whom can we compare the one who have it ?     wicked and virtuous woman    any wound , but not a wound of the heart !   any wickedness , but not the wickedness of a woman !   any suffering , but not suffer from one foe !   any vengeance , but not the vengeance of one enemy !   there be no poison bad than that of a serpent ,   no venom great than that of a woman .   I would rather live with a dragon or a lion   than live with a wicked woman .    a woman wicked disposition change her appearance ,   and make her face as dark as a bear .   when her husband sit among his neighbor ,   a bitter sigh escape he unawares .     there be hardly an evil like that in a woman ;   may she fall to the lot of the sinner !   like a sandy hill to aged foot   be a garrulous wife to a quiet husband .   do not be entice by a womans beauty ,   or be greedy for her wealth .   Harsh be the slavery and great the shame   when a wife support her husband .     depressed mind , gloomy face ,   and a wounded heart\xe2\x80\x94a wicked woman . droop hand and quake knee ,   any wife who do not make her husband happy .   with a woman sin have a beginning ,   and because of she we all die .    allow water no outlet ,   and no boldness of speech to a wicked woman .   if she do not go along as you direct ,   cut she away from you .
