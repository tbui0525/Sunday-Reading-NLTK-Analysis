b '   Manassehs Impiety .      Manasseh be twelve year old when he become king , and he reign fifty - five year in Jerusalem .      he do what be evil in the   Lord s sight , follow the abominable practice of the nation whom the   Lord   dispossess before the Israelites .      he rebuild the high place which Hezekiah his father have tear down . he set up altar to the Baals , and also make asherahs . he bow down to the whole host of heaven and serve they .      he build altar in the house of the   Lord , of which the   Lord   have say : in Jerusalem shall my name be forever ;      and he build altar to the whole host of heaven in the two court of the house of the   Lord .      it be he , too , who immolate his child by fire in the Valley of Ben - hinnom . he practice soothsaye and divination , and reintroduce the consulting of ghost and spirit . he do much evil in the   Lord s sight and provoke he to anger .      an idol he have make he place in the house of God , of which God have say to David and to his son Solomon : in this house and in Jerusalem , which I have choose out of all the tribe of Israel , I shall set my name forever .      I will no long make Israel step out of the land I assign to your ancestor , provide that they be careful to observe all I command they , the entire law , the statute , and the ordinance give by Moses .     Manasseh mislead Judah and the inhabitant of Jerusalem into do even great evil than the nation the   Lord   have destroy at the coming of the Israelites .      the   Lord   speak to Manasseh and his people , but they pay no attention .    Manassehs Conversion .      therefore the   Lord   bring against they the army commander of the assyrian king ; they capture Manasseh with hook , shackle he with chain , and transport he to Babylon .        in his distress , he begin to appease the   Lord , his God . he humble himself abjectly before the God of his ancestor ,      and pray to he .    the   Lord   let himself be win over : he hear his prayer and restore he to his kingdom in Jerusalem . then Manasseh know that the   Lord   be indeed God .     afterward he build an outer wall for the City of David to the west of Gihon in the valley , extend to the Fish Gate and encircle Ophel ; he build it very high . he station army officer in all the fortified city of Judah .      he remove the foreign god and the idol from the   Lord s house and all the altar he have build on the mount of the   Lord s house and in Jerusalem , and cast they outside the city .        he restore the altar of the   Lord , and sacrifice on it communion offering and thank offering , and command Judah to serve the   Lord , the God of Israel .      though the people continue to sacrifice on the high place , they now do so to the   Lord , their God .      the rest of the act of Manasseh , his prayer to his God , and the word of the seer who speak to he in the name of the   Lord , the God of Israel , be write in the chronicle of the king of Israel .      his prayer and how his supplication be hear , all his sin and his treachery , the site where he build high place and set up asherah and carve image before he humble himself , all this be record in the chronicle of his seer .      Manasseh rest with his ancestor and be bury in his own palace . his son Amon succeed he as king .    Reign of Amon .      Amon be twenty - two year old when he become king , and he reign two year in Jerusalem .      he do what be evil in the   Lord s sight , as his father Manasseh have do . Amon offer sacrifice to all the idol his father Manasseh have make , and serve they .      moreover , he do not humble himself before the   Lord   as his father Manasseh have humble himself ; on the contrary , Amon only increase his guilt .      his official plot against he and put he to death in his palace ,      but the people of the land then slew all who have plot against King Amon , and the people of the land make his son Josiah king in his stead .
