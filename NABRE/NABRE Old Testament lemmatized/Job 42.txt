b '    then Job answer the   Lord   and say :     I know that you can do all thing ,    and that no purpose of yours can be hinder .   who be this who obscure counsel with ignorance ? I have speak but do not understand ;   thing too marvelous for I , which I do not know .    listen , and I will speak ; I will question you , and you tell I the answer .   by hearsay I have hear of you ,   but now my eye have see you .    therefore I disown what I have say ,   and repent in dust and ashe .      Jobs Restoration .     and after the   Lord   have speak these word to Job , the   Lord   say to Eliphaz the Temanite , my anger blaze against you and your two friend !    you have not speak rightly concern I , as have my servant Job .      so now take seven bull and seven ram , and go to my servant Job , and sacrifice a burn offering for yourself , and let my servant Job pray for you .    to he I will show favor , and not punish your folly , for you have not speak rightly concern I , as have my servant Job .      then Eliphaz the Temanite , and Bildad the Shuhite , and Zophar the Naamathite , go and do as the   Lord   have command they . the   Lord   show favor to Job .     the   Lord   also restore the prosperity of Job , after he have pray for his friend ; the   Lord   even give to Job twice    as much as he have before .      then all his brother and sister come to he , and all his former acquaintance , and they dine with he in his house . they console and comfort he for all the evil the   Lord   have bring upon he , and each one give he a piece of money    and a gold ring .      thus the   Lord   bless the later day of Job more than his early one . now he have fourteen thousand sheep , six thousand camel , a thousand yoke of oxen , and a thousand she - donkey .      he also have seven son and three daughter :      the first daughter he call Jemimah , the second Keziah , and the third Keren - happuch .        in all the land no other woman be as beautiful as the daughter of Job ; and their father give they an inheritance    among their brother .     after this , Job live a hundred and forty year ; and he see his child , his grandchild , and even his great - grandchild .        then Job die , old and full of year .
