b ' prayer for Deliverance from the Wicked   a psalm of David . Lord , I call to you ; hasten to I ;   listen to my plea when I call .   let my prayer be incense    before you ;   my uplifted hand an evening offering .    set a guard ,   Lord , before my mouth ,   keep watch over the door of my lip .    do not let my heart incline to evil ,   to perform deed in wickedness . on the delicacy of evildoer   let I not feast .    let a righteous person strike I ; it be mercy if he reprove I .   do not withhold oil from my head    while my prayer oppose their evil deed .   may their leader be cast over the cliff ,   so that they hear that my speech be pleasing .   like the plowing and break up of the earth ,   our bone be strew at the mouth of Sheol .   for my eye be upon you , o   Lord , my Lord ;    in you I take refuge ; do not take away my soul .   guard I from the trap they have set for I ,   from the snare of evildoer .    let the wicked fall into their own net ,   while only I pass over they safely .
