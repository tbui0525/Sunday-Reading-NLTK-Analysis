b '   the Folly of Idolatry .     hear the word the   Lord   speak to you , house of Israel .      thus say the   Lord : do not learn the way of the nation ,   and have no fear of the sign in the heaven ,    even though the nation fear they .    for the carving of the nation be nonentity ,   wood cut from the forest , fashion by artisan with the adze ,     adorn with silver and gold . with nail and hammer they be fasten ,   so they do not fall .    like a scarecrow in a cucumber field be they ,   they can not speak ; they must be carry about ,   for they can not walk . do not fear they , they can do no harm ,   neither can they do good .    no one be like you ,   Lord ,   you be great ,   great and mighty be your name .    who would not fear you ,   King of the nation ,   for it be your due ! among all the wise of the nation ,   and in all their domain ,   there be none like you .    one and all they be stupid and senseless ,   the instruction from nonentities\xe2\x80\x94only wood !   silver plate bring from Tarshish ,   and gold from Ophir , the work of the artisan   and the handiwork of the smelter , clothe with violet and purple\xe2\x80\x94   all of they the work of skilled worker .   the   Lord   be truly God ,   he be the live God , the eternal King , before whose anger the earth quake ,   whose wrath the nation can not endure .      thus shall you say of they : the god that do not make heaven and earth\xe2\x80\x94let these perish from earth and from beneath heaven !       the one who make the earth by his power ,   establish the world by his wisdom ,   and by his skill stretch out the heavens .    when he thunder , the water in the heavens roar ,   and he bring up cloud from the end of the earth , make lightning flash in the rain ,   and bring forth the wind from his storehouse .   everyone be too stupid to know ;   every artisan be put to shame by his idol : he have mold a fraud ,   without breath of life .    they be nothing , object of ridicule ;   they will perish in their time of punishment .   Jacobs portion be nothing like they :   for he be the maker of everything ! Israel be his very own tribe ,   Lord   of host be his name .     abandonment of Judah   gather up your bundle from the land ,   City live under siege !    for thus say the   Lord : now , at this time   I will sling away the inhabitant of the land ; I will hem they in ,   that they may be take .   Woe be I ! I be undo ,   my wound be beyond healing . yet I have think :   if I make light of my sickness , I can bear it .   my tent be ruin ,   all its cord be sever . my child have leave I , they be no more :   no one to pitch my tent ,   no one to raise its curtain .    how stupid be the shepherd !   the   Lord   they have not seek ; for this reason they have fail ,   and all their flock scatter .    listen ! a rumor ! here it come ,   a great commotion from the land of the north : to make the city of Judah a desolation ,   the haunt of jackal .    prayer of Jeremiah   I know ,   Lord ,   that no one choose their way , nor determine their course   nor direct their own step .   correct I ,   Lord , but with equity ,   not in anger , lest you diminish I .   pour out your wrath on the nation that do not know you ,   on the tribe that do not call your name ; for they have utterly devour Jacob ,   and lay waste his home .
