b '    in those day the Philistines muster their military force to fight against Israel . so Achish say to David , you realize , of course , that you and your warrior    must march out for battle with I .

Saul in despair .     the Philistines rally and , come to Shunem , they encamp . Saul , too , muster all Israel ; they camp on Gilboa .      when Saul see the philistine camp , he grow afraid and lose heart completely .      he consult the   Lord ; but the   Lord   give no answer , neither in dream nor by Urim nor through prophet .        then Saul say to his servant , find I a medium    through whom I can seek counsel . his servant answer he , there be a woman in Endor who be a medium .     the Medium at Endor .     so he disguise himself , put on other clothe , and set out with two companion . they come to the woman at night , and Saul say to she , Divine for I ; conjure up the spirit I tell you .        but the woman answer he , you know what Saul have do , how he expel the medium and diviner from the land . then why be you try to entrap I and get I kill ?      but Saul swear to she by the   Lord , as the   Lord   live , you shall incur no blame for this .      whom do you want I to conjure up ? the woman ask he . conjure up Samuel for I , he reply .    Samuel Appears .     when the woman see Samuel , she shriek at the top of her voice and say to Saul , why have you deceive I ? you be Saul !      but the king say to she , do not be afraid . what do you see ? I see a god rise from the earth , she reply .      what do he look like ? ask Saul . an old man be come up wrap in a robe , she reply .

Saul reply : I be in great distress , for the Philistines be wage war against I and God have turn away from I . since God no long answer I through prophet or in dream , I have call upon you to tell I what I should do .        to this Samuel say : but why do you ask I , if the   Lord   have abandon you for your neighbor ?        the   Lord   have do to you what he declare through I : he have tear the kingdom from your hand and have give it to your neighbor David .     because you disobey the   Lord s directive and would not carry out his fierce anger against Amalek , the   Lord   have do this to you today .        moreover , the   Lord   will deliver Israel , and you as well , into the hand of the Philistines . by tomorrow you and your son will be with I , and the   Lord   will have deliver the army of Israel into the hand of the Philistines .      immediately Saul fall full length on the ground , in great fear because of Samuels message . he have no strength leave , since he have eat nothing all that day and night .      then the woman come to Saul and , see that he be quite terror - stricken , say to he : remember , your maidservant obey you : I take my life in my hand and carry out the request you make of I .      now you , in turn , please listen to your maidservant . let I set out a bit of food for you to eat , so that you be strong enough to go on your way .      but he refuse , say , I will not eat . however , when his servant join the woman in urge he , he listen to their entreaty , get up from the ground , and sit on a couch .      the woman have a stall - feed calf in the house , which she now quickly slaughter . then take flour , she knead it and bake unleavened bread .      she set the meal before Saul and his servant , and they eat . then they get up and leave the same night .
