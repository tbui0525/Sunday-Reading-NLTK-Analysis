b '   Jobs Fourth Reply .     then Job answer and say :     I have hear this sort of thing many time .    Troublesome comforter , all of you !   be there no end to windy word ?   what sickness make you rattle on ?   I also could talk as you do ,   be you in my place . I could declaim over you ,   or wag my head at you ;   I could strengthen you with talk ,   with mere chatter give relief .   if I speak , my pain be not relieve ;   if I stop speak , nothing change .   but now he have exhaust I ;   you have stun all my companion .   you    have shrivel I up ; it be a witness ,   my gauntness rise up to testify against I ;   his wrath tear and assail I ,   he gnash his tooth against I ; my enemy look dagger at I .    they gape at I with their mouth ; they strike I on the cheek with insult ;   they be all enlist against I .   God have give I over to the impious ;   into the hand of the wicked he have cast I .   I be in peace , but he dislodge I ,   seize I by the neck , dash I to piece . he have set I up for a target ;    his arrow strike I from all direction . he pierce my side without mercy ,   pour out my gall upon the ground .   he pierce I , thrust upon thrust ,   rush at I like a warrior .   I have sew sackcloth on my skin ,   lay my horn low in the dust .   my face be inflame with weeping ,   darkness cover my eye ,   although my hand be free from violence ,   and my prayer sincere .   o earth , do not cover my blood ,   nor let my outcry come to rest !    even now my witness    be in heaven ,   my advocate be on high .   my friend it be who wrong I ;   before God my eye shed tear ,   that justice may be do for a mortal with God :   as for a man with his neighbor .   for my year be number ,   and I go the road of no return .
