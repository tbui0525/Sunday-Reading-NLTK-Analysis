b '   warn against Adultery    my son , to my wisdom be attentive ,   to understand incline your ear ,   that you may act discreetly ,   and your lip guard what you know .   indeed , the lip of the stranger drip honey ,    and her mouth be smooth than oil ;    but in the end she be as bitter as wormwood ,   as sharp as a two - edge sword .   her foot go down to death ,   her step reach Sheol ;    her path ramble , you know not where ,   lest you see before you the road to life .   so now , child , listen to I ,   do not stray from the word of my mouth .   keep your way far from she ,    do not go near the door of her house ,   lest you give your honor    to other ,    and your year to a merciless one ;   Lest outsider take their fill of your wealth ,   and your hard - win earning go to another house ;   and you groan in the end ,   when your flesh and your body be consume ;   and you say , oh , why do I hate instruction ,   and my heart spurn reproof !   why do I not listen to the voice of my teacher ,   incline my ear to my instructor !   I be all but ruin ,   in the midst of the public assembly !   drink water    from your own cistern ,   run water from your own well .   should your water source be disperse abroad ,   stream of water in the street ?   let they be yours alone ,   not share with outsider ;   let your fountain be bless and have joy of the wife of your youth ,    your lovely hind , your graceful doe .   of whose love you will ever have your fill ,   and by her ardor always be intoxicate .   why then , my son , should you be intoxicate with a stranger ,   and embrace another woman ?   indeed , the way of each person be plain to the   Lord s sight ;   all their path he survey ;    by their own iniquity the wicked will be catch ,   in the mesh of their own sin they will be hold fast ;   they will die from lack of discipline ,   lose because of their great folly .
