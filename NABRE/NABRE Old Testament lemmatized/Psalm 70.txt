b ' prayer for Divine help   for the leader ; of David . for remembrance .     graciously rescue I , God !    come quickly to help I ,   Lord !    let those who seek my life   be confuse and put to shame .   let those who desire my ruin   turn back in disgrace .   let those who say Aha !    turn back in their shame .   but may all who seek you   rejoice and be glad in you , those who long for your help   always say , God be glorify !    I be miserable and poor .   God , come to I quickly ! you be my help and deliverer .   Lord , do not delay !             '
