b ' prayer for victory   a song ; a psalm of David .    I   my heart be steadfast , God ;    my heart be steadfast .   let I sing and chant praise .   Awake , lyre and harp !   I will wake the dawn .    I will praise you among the people ,   Lord ;   I will chant your praise among the nation .    for your mercy be great than the heavens ;   your faithfulness , to the sky .     II   Appear on high over the heaven , God ;   your glory above all the earth .   help with your right hand and answer we   that your loved one may escape .     God speak in his holiness :     I will exult , I will apportion Shechem ;   the valley of Succoth I will measure out .   Gilead be mine , mine be Manasseh ;   Ephraim be the helmet for my head ,   Judah , my scepter .   Moab be my washbowl ;   upon Edom I cast my sandal ;    I will shout in triumph over Philistia .     who will bring I to the fortified city ?   who will lead I into Edom ?   be it not you who reject we , God ?   do you no long march with our army ?    give we aid against the foe ;   worthless be human help .   we will triumph with the help of God ,   who will trample down our foe .
