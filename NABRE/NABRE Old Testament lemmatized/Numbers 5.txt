b '   the Unclean Expelled .     the   Lord   say to Moses :      order the Israelites to expel from camp everyone with a scaly infection , and everyone suffer from a discharge , and everyone who have become unclean by contact with a corpse .         male and female alike , you shall expel they . you shall expel they from the camp so that they do not defile their camp , where I dwell in their midst .        this the Israelites do , expel they from the camp ; just as the   Lord   have command Moses , so the Israelites do . Unjust Possession .        the   Lord   say to Moses :       tell the Israelites : if a man or a woman commit any offense against another person , thus break faith with the   Lord , and thereby become guilty ,      that person shall confess the wrong that have be do , make restitution in full , and in addition give one fifth of its value to the one that have be wrong .      however , if there be no next of kin ,    one to whom restitution can be make , the restitution shall be make to the   Lord   and shall fall to the priest ; this be apart from the ram of atonement with which the priest make atonement for the guilty individual .      likewise , every contribution among the sacred offering that the Israelites present to the priest will belong to he .        each shall possess his own sacred offering ; what be give to a priest shall be his .     Ordeal for Suspected Adultery .     the   Lord   say to Moses :      speak to the Israelites and tell they : if a man wife go astray and become unfaithful to he      by virtue of a man have intercourse with she    in secret from her husband and she be able to conceal the fact that she have defile herself for lack of a witness who might have catch she in the act ;      or if a man be overcome by a feeling of jealousy that make he suspect his wife , and she have defile herself ; or if a man be overcome by a feeling of jealousy that make he suspect his wife and she have not defile herself\xe2\x80\x94      then the man shall bring his wife to the priest as well as an offering on her behalf , a tenth of an ephah    of barley meal . however , he shall not pour oil on it nor put frankincense over it , since it be a grain offering of jealousy , a grain offering of remembrance which recall wrongdoing .     the priest shall first have the woman come forward and stand before the   Lord .      in an earthen vessel he shall take holy water ,    as well as some dust from the floor of the tabernacle and put it in the water .        make the woman stand before the   Lord , the priest shall uncover her head and place in her hand the grain offering of remembrance , that is , the grain offering of jealousy , while he himself shall hold the water of bitterness that bring a curse .      then the priest shall adjure the woman , say to she , if no other man have have intercourse with you , and you have not go astray by defile yourself while under the authority of your husband , be immune to this water of bitterness that bring a curse .      but if you have go astray while under the authority of your husband , and if you have defile yourself and a man other than your husband have have intercourse with you\xe2\x80\x94      so shall the priest adjure the woman with this imprecation\xe2\x80\x94may the   Lord   make you a curse and malediction    among your people by cause your uterus to fall and your belly to swell !      may this water , then , that bring a curse , enter your bowel to make your belly swell and your uterus fall !    and the woman shall say , amen , amen !        the priest shall put these curse in writing and shall then wash they off into the water of bitterness ,      and he will have the woman drink the water of bitterness that bring a curse , so that the water that bring a curse may enter into she to her bitter hurt .      but first the priest shall take the grain offering of jealousy from the womans hand , and having elevate the grain offering before the   Lord , shall bring it to the altar ,      where he shall take a handful of the grain offering as a token offering and burn it on the altar .    only then shall he have the woman drink the water .      once he have have her drink the water , if she have defile herself and be unfaithful to her husband , the water that bring a curse will enter into she to her bitter hurt , and her belly will swell and her uterus will fall , so that she will become a curse among her people .      if , however , the woman have not defile herself , but be still pure , she will be immune and will still be fertile .     this , then , be the ritual for jealousy when a woman go astray while under the authority of her husband and defile herself ,      or when such a feeling of jealousy come over a man that he become suspicious of his wife ; he shall have her stand before the   Lord , and the priest shall perform this entire ritual for she .      the man shall be free from punishment ,    but the woman shall bear her punishment .
