b '   David Consults with Jonathan .     David flee from Naioth in Ramah , and go to Jonathan . what have I do ? he ask he . what crime or what offense do your father hold against I that he seek my life ?        Jonathan answer he : Heaven forbid that you should die ! my father do nothing , great or small , without tell I . why , then , should my father conceal this from I ? it can not be true !      but David reply : your father be well aware that I be favor with your friendship , so he have decide , Jonathan must not know about this or he will be grieve . nevertheless , as the   Lord   live and as you live , there be only a step between I and death .      Jonathan then say to David , I will do whatever you say .      David answer : tomorrow be the new moon , when I should in fact dine with the king . let I go and hide in the open country until evening .        if it turn out that your father miss I , say , David urge I to let he go on short notice to his city Bethlehem , because his whole clan be hold its seasonal sacrifice there .        if he say , very well , your servant be safe . but if he become quite angry , you can be sure he have plan some harm .       do this kindness for your servant because of the   Lord s covenant into which you bring we : if I be guilty , kill I yourself ! why should you give I up to your father ?      but Jonathan answer : not I ! if ever I find out that my father be determined to harm you , I will certainly let you know .      David then ask Jonathan , who will tell I if your father give you a harsh answer ?    Mutual Agreement .     Jonathan reply to David , Come , let we go out into the field . when they be out in the open country together ,      Jonathan say to David : as the   Lord , the God of Israel , live , I will sound out my father about this time tomorrow . whether he be well disposed toward David or not , I will inform you .       should it please my father to bring any harm upon you , may the   Lord   do thus to Jonathan and more ,    if I do not inform you of it and send you on your way in peace . may the   Lord   be with you even as he be with my father .      only this : if I be still alive , may you show I the kindness of the   Lord . but if I die ,      never cut off your kindness from my house . and when the   Lord   cut off all the enemy of David from the face of the land ,      the name of Jonathan must never be cut off from the family of David , or the   Lord   will make you answer for it .      and in his love for David , Jonathan renew his oath to he , because he love he as he love himself .     Jonathan then say to he : tomorrow be the new moon ; you will be miss , since your place will be vacant .      on the third day you will be miss all the more . go to the spot where you hide on the other occasion and wait near the mound there .        on the third day of the month I will shoot arrow to the side of it , as though aim at a target .      I will then send my attendant to recover the arrow . if in fact I say to he , look , the arrow be this side of you ; pick it up , come , for you be safe . as the   Lord   live , there will be nothing to fear .      but if I say to the boy , look , the arrow be beyond you , go , for the   Lord   send you away .      however , in the matter which you and I have discuss , the   Lord   shall be between you and I forever .      so David hide in the open country . Davids Absence .   on the day of the new moon , when the king sit down at the feast to dine ,      he take his usual place against the wall . Jonathan sit face he , while Abner sit at the king side . Davids place be vacant .       Saul , however , say nothing that day , for he think , he must have become unclean by accident .        on the next day , the second day of the month , Davids place be still vacant . so Saul ask his son Jonathan , why have the son of Jesse not come to table yesterday or today ?      Jonathan explain to Saul : David plead with I to let he go to Bethlehem .      please let I go , he beg , for we be have a clan sacrifice in our city , and my brother insist on my presence . now then , if you think well of I , give I leave to visit my brother . that be why he have not come to the king table .      but Saul grow angry with Jonathan and say to he : Son of a rebellious woman , do I not know that , to your own disgrace and to the disgrace of your mother nakedness , you be the companion of Jesses son ?      for as long as the son of Jesse live upon the earth , you can not make good your claim to the kingship !    now send for he , and bring he to I , for he must die .        but Jonathan argue with his father Saul : why should he die ? what have he do ?      at this Saul brandish his spear to strike he , and thus Jonathan learn that his father be determined to kill David .        Jonathan spring up from the table in a rage and eat nothing that second day of the month , because he be grieve on Davids account , and because his father have humiliate he .    Jonathans Farewell .     the next morning Jonathan , accompany by a young boy , go out into the field for his appointment with David .      there he say to the boy , run and find the arrow . and as the boy run , he shoot an arrow past he .      when the boy make for the spot where Jonathan have shoot the arrow , Jonathan call after he , the arrow be far on !      again he call to the boy , hurry , be quick , do not delay ! jonathan boy pick up the arrow and bring it to his master .      the boy suspect nothing ; only Jonathan and David know what be mean .      then Jonathan give his weapon to his boy and say to he , go , take they to the city .      when the boy have go , David rise from beside the mound and fall on his face to the ground three time in homage . they kiss each other and weep aloud together .       at length Jonathan say to David , go in peace , in keep with what the two of we have swear by the name of the   Lord : the   Lord   shall be between you and I , and between your offspring and mine forever .
