b '   on Laziness and Foolishness    the sluggard be like a filthy stone ;    everyone hiss at his disgrace .   the sluggard be like a lump of dung ;   whoever touch it shake it off the hand .     an undisciplined child be a disgrace to its father ;   if it be a daughter , she bring he to poverty .    a thoughtful daughter obtain a husband of her own ;   a shameless one be her father grief .   a hussy shame her father and her husband ;   she be despise by both .     like music at the time of mourning be ill - time talk ,    but lash and discipline be at all time wisdom .    teach a fool be like glue a broken pot ,    or rouse another from deep sleep .   whoever talk with a fool talk to someone asleep ;   when it be over , he say , what be that ?     weep over the dead , for their light have go out ;   weep over the fool , for sense have leave he . weep but less bitterly over the dead , for they be at rest ;   bad than death be the life of a fool .   mourn for the dead , seven days\xe2\x80\x94    but for the wicked fool , a whole lifetime .     do not talk much with the stupid ,   or visit the unintelligent . beware of they lest you have trouble   and be spatter when they shake themselves off . avoid they and you will find rest   and not be weary by their lack of sense .   what be heavy than lead ?   what be its name but fool ?   sand , salt , and an iron weight   be easy to bear than the stupid person .      a wooden beam firmly bond into a building    be not loosen by an earthquake ; so the mind firmly resolve after careful deliberation   will not be afraid at any time .   the mind solidly back by intelligent thought   be like a stucco decoration on a smooth wall .   small stone lie on an open height   will not remain when the wind blow ; so a timid mind base on foolish plan   can not stand up to fear of any kind .    the Preservation of Friendship    whoever jab the eye bring tear ;   whoever pierce the heart bare its feeling .   whoever throw a stone at bird drive they away ;   whoever insult a friend break up the friendship .   should you draw a sword against a friend ,   do not despair , for it can be undo .   should you open your mouth against a friend ,   do not worry , for you can be reconcile . but a contemptuous insult , a confidence break ,   or a treacherous attack will drive any friend away .     win your neighbor trust while he be poor ,   so that you may rejoice with he in his prosperity . in time of trouble remain true to he ,   so that you may share in his inheritance when it come .   the billow smoke of a furnace precede the fire ,   so insult precede bloodshed .   I be not ashamed to shelter a friend ,   and I will not hide from he .   but if harm should come to I because of he ,   all who hear of it will beware of he .    Prayer    who will set a guard over my mouth ,   an effective seal on my lip , that I may not fail through they ,   and my tongue may not destroy I ?              '
