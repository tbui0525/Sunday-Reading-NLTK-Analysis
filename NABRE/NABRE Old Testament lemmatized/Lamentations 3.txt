b '   the Voice of a Suffering Individual    I be one who have know affliction   under the rod of Gods anger ,    one whom he have drive and force to walk   in darkness , not in light ;   against I alone he turn his hand\xe2\x80\x94   again and again all day long .     he have wear away my flesh and my skin ,   he have break my bone ;    he have besiege I all around   with poverty and hardship ;   he have leave I to dwell in dark place   like those long dead .      he have hem I in with no escape ,   weigh I down with chain ;   even when I cry for help ,   he stop my prayer ;    he have hem in my way with fit stone ,   and make my path crooked .     he have be a bear lie in wait for I ,   a lion in hiding !    he turn I aside and tear I apart ,   leave I ravage .    he bend his bow , and set I up   as a target for his arrow .      he pierce my kidney   with shaft from his quiver .    I have become a laughingstock to all my people ,   their taunt all day long ;    he have sate I with bitterness ,   fill I with wormwood .      he have make I eat gravel ,   trample I into the dust ;   my life be deprive of peace ,   I have forget what happiness be ;   my endure hope , I say ,   have perish before the   Lord .     the thought of my wretched homelessness   be wormwood and poison ;   remember it over and over ,   my soul be downcast .   but this I will call to mind ;    therefore I will hope :     the   Lord s act of mercy be not exhaust ,   his compassion be not spend ;    they be renew each morning\xe2\x80\x94   great be your faithfulness !   the   Lord   be my portion , I tell myself ,   therefore I will hope in he .      the   Lord   be good to those who trust in he ,   to the one that seek he ;    it be good to hope in silence   for the   Lord s deliverance .   it be good for a person , when young ,   to bear the yoke ,     to sit alone and in silence ,   when its weight lie heavy ,   to put one mouth in the dust\xe2\x80\x94    there may yet be hope\xe2\x80\x94   to offer one cheek to be strike ,   to be fill with disgrace .      for the Lord do not   reject forever ;    though he bring grief , he take pity ,   accord to the abundance of his mercy ;    he do not willingly afflict   or bring grief to human being .      that someone trample underfoot   all the prisoner in the land ,   or deny justice to anyone   in the very sight of the most high ,   or subvert a person lawsuit\xe2\x80\x94   do the Lord not see ?     who speak so that it come to pass ,   unless the Lord command it ?   be it not at the word of the most High   that both good and bad take place ?    what should the living complain about ?   about their sin !      let we search and examine our way ,   and return to the   Lord !    let we lift up our heart as well as our hand   toward God in heaven !   we have rebel and be obstinate ;   you have not forgive we .     you wrap yourself in wrath and pursue we ,   kill without pity ;    you wrap yourself in a cloud ,   which no prayer could pierce .   you have make we filth and rubbish   among the people .      they have open their mouth against we ,   all our enemy ;   panic and the pit have be our lot ,   desolation and destruction ;     my eye stream with tear over the destruction   of the daughter of my people .      my eye will flow without cease ,   without rest ,   until the   Lord   from heaven   look down and see .   I be torment by the sight   of all the daughter of my city .     without cause , my enemy snare I   as though I be a bird ;   they try to end my life in the pit ,   pelt I with stone .   the water flow over my head :   and I say , I be lose !      I have call upon your name , O   Lord ,    from the bottom of the pit ;   you hear I call , do not let your ear be deaf   to my cry for help .   you draw near on the day I call you ;   you say , do not fear !     you plead my case , Lord ,   you redeem my life .   you see ,   Lord , how I be wrong ;   do I justice !    you see all their vindictiveness ,   all their plot against I .     you hear their reproach ,   Lord ,   all their plot against I ,   the whisper murmuring of my adversary ,   against I all day long ;   look ! whether they sit or stand ,   I be the butt of their taunt .     give they what they deserve ,   Lord ,   accord to their deed ;   give they hardness of heart ;   your curse be upon they ;    pursue they in wrath and destroy they   from under the   Lord s heaven !
