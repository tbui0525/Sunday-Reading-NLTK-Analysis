b '   the Desolation of Jerusalem    how solitary sit the city ,   once fill with people . she who be great among the nation   be now like a widow . once a princess among the province ,   now a toil slave .     she weep incessantly in the night ,   her cheek damp with tear . she have no one to comfort she   from all her lover ;   her friend have all betray she ,   and become her enemy .      Judah have go into exile ,   after oppression and harsh labor ; she dwell among the nation ,   yet find no rest :   all her pursuer overtake she   in the narrow strait .     the road to Zion mourn ,   empty of pilgrim to her feast . all her gateway be desolate ,   her priest groan , her young woman grieve ;   her lot be bitter .      her foe have come out on top ,   her enemy be secure ; because the   Lord   have afflict she   for her many rebellion . her child have go away ,   captive before the foe .     from daughter Zion have go   all her glory : her prince have become like ram   that find no pasture . they have go off exhausted   before their pursuer .     Jerusalem remember   in day of wretched homelessness , all the precious thing she once have   in day go by . but when her people fall into the hand of the foe ,   and she have no help , her foe look on and laugh   at her collapse .     Jerusalem have sin grievously ,   therefore she have become a mockery ; those who honor she now demean she ,   for they see her nakedness ; she herself groan out loud ,   and turn away .      her uncleanness be on her skirt ;   she have no thought of her future . her downfall be astonishing ,   with no one to comfort she . look , o   Lord , at my misery ;   how the enemy triumph !      the foe stretch out his hand   to all her precious thing ; she have see the nation   enter her sanctuary , those you forbid to come   into your assembly .      all her people groan ,   search for bread ; they give their precious thing for food ,   to retain the breath of life . look , o   Lord , and pay attention   to how I have be demean !     come , all who pass by the way ,   pay attention and see : be there any pain like my pain ,   which have be ruthlessly inflict upon I , with which the   Lord   have torment I   on the day of his blaze wrath ?     from on high he hurl fire down   into my very bone ; he spread out a net for my foot ,   and turn I back . he have leave I desolate ,   in misery all day long .      the yoke of my rebellion be bind together ,   fasten by his hand . his yoke be upon my neck ;   he have make my strength fail . the Lord have deliver I into the grip   of those I can not resist .     all my valiant warrior   my Lord have cast away ; he proclaim a feast against I   to crush my young man ; my Lord have tread in the wine press   virgin daughter Judah .     for these thing I weep\xe2\x80\x94my eye ! my eye !   they stream with tear ! how far from I be anyone to comfort ,   anyone to restore my life . my child be desolate ;   the enemy have prevail .      Zion stretch out her hand ,   with no one to comfort she ; the   Lord   have order against Jacob   his foe all around ; Jerusalem have become in their midst   a thing unclean .     the   Lord   be in the right ;   I have defy his command . listen , all you people ,   and see my pain : my young woman and young man   have go into captivity .      I cry out to my lover ,   but they fail I .   my priest and my elder   perish in the city ; how desperately they search for food ,   to save their life !     look , o   Lord , at the anguish I suffer !   my stomach churn , and my heart recoil within I :   how bitter I be ! outside the sword bereaves\xe2\x80\x94   indoors , there be death .      hear how I be groan ;   there be no one to comfort I . all my enemy hear of my misery and rejoice   over what you have do . bring on the day you proclaim ,   and let they become like I !     let all their evil come before you   and deal with they as you have so ruthlessly deal with I   for all my rebellion . my groan be many ,   my heart be sick .
