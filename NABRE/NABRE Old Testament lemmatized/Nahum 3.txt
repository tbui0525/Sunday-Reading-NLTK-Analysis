b '    ah ! the bloody city ,   all lie , full of plunder ,   whose looting never stop !    the crack of the whip ,   the rumble of wheel ; horse gallop ,   chariot bound ,   Cavalry charging ,   the flash of the sword ,   the gleam of the spear ; a multitude of slain ,   a mass of corpse , endless body   to stumble upon !   for the many debauchery of the prostitute ,   a charming mistress of witchcraft , who enslave nation with her prostitution ,   and people by her witchcraft :     I now come against you\xe2\x80\x94   oracle of the   Lord   of hosts\xe2\x80\x94   and I will lift your skirt above your face ; I will show your nakedness to the nation ,   to the kingdom your shame !    I will cast filth upon you ,   disgrace you and make you a spectacle ;   until everyone who see you   run from you say , Nineveh be destroy ;   who can pity she ? where can I find   any to console you ?    Ninevehs Inescapable Fate   be you well than No - amon     that be set among the Niles canal , surround by water ,   with the river for her rampart   and water for her wall ?   Ethiopia be her strength ,   and Egypt without end ; put    and the Libyans   be her ally .   yet even she become an exile ,   and go into captivity ; even her little one be dash to piece   at the corner of every street ; for her noble they cast lot ,   and all her great one be put into chain .   you , too , will drink of this ;   you will be overcome ;   you , too , will seek   a refuge from the foe .   but all your fortress be fig tree ,   bear early fig ;   when shake , they fall   into the devourer mouth .   indeed your troop   be woman in your midst ; to your foe be open wide   the gate of your land ,   fire have consume their bar .     draw water for the siege ,    strengthen your fortress ; go down into the mud   and tread the clay ,   take hold of the brick mold !   there the fire will consume you ,   the sword will cut you down ;   it will consume you like the grasshopper .    multiply like the grasshopper ,   multiply like the locust !    you have make your trader    more numerous   than the star of the heaven ;   like grasshopper that shed their skin and fly away .   your sentry be like locust ,   and your scribe like locust swarm gather on the rubble fence   on a cold day ! yet when the sun rise , they vanish ,   and no one know where they have go .     your shepherd slumber ,   o king of Assyria ,   your noble have go to rest ; your people be scatter upon the mountain ,   with none to gather they .   there be no healing for your hurt ,   your wound be fatal . all who hear this news of you   clap their hand over you ; for who have not suffer   under your endless malice ?
