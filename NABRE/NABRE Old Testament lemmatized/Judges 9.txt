b '    Abimelech , son of Jerubbaal , go to his mother kin in Shechem ,    and say to they and to the whole clan to which his mother family belong ,      put this question to all the lord of Shechem : which be well for you : that seventy man , all Jerubbaals son , rule over you , or that one man rule over you ? you must remember that I be your own flesh and bone .        when his mother kin repeat these word on his behalf to all the lord of Shechem , they set their heart on Abimelech , think , he be our kin .      they also give he seventy piece of silver from the temple of Baal - berith , with which Abimelech hire worthless man and outlaws as his follower .      he then go to his father house in Ophrah , and kill his brother , the seventy son of Jerubbaal , on one stone . only the young son of Jerubbaal , Jotham , escape , for he be hide .      then all the lord of Shechem and all Beth - millo come together and make Abimelech king by the terebinth at the memorial pillar in Shechem .     when this be report to Jotham , he go and stand at the top of Mount Gerizim and cry out in a loud voice : hear I , lord of Shechem ,   and may God hear you !   one day the tree go out   to anoint a king over themselves . so they say to the olive tree ,   Reign over we .   but the olive tree answer they ,   must I give up my rich oil ,   whereby god and human being be honor ,    and go off to hold sway over the tree ?   then the tree say to the fig tree ,   come ; you reign over we !   but the fig tree answer they ,   must I give up my sweetness   and my sweet fruit ,   and go off to hold sway over the tree ?   then the tree say to the vine ,   come you , reign over we .   but the vine answer they ,   must I give up my wine   that cheer god    and human being ,   and go off to hold sway over the tree ?   then all the tree say to the buckthorn ,   come ; you reign over we !   the buckthorn answer the tree ,   if you be anoint I in good faith ,   to make I king over you ,   come , and take refuge in my shadow .   but if not , let fire come from the buckthorn   and devour the cedar of Lebanon .      now then , if you have act in good faith and integrity in appoint Abimelech your king , if you have act with good will toward Jerubbaal and his house , and if you have treat he as he deserved\xe2\x80\x94      for my father fight for you at the risk of his life when he deliver you from the power of Midian ,      but you have rise against my father house today and kill his seventy son upon one stone and make Abimelech , the son of his maidservant ,    king over the lord of Shechem , because he be your kin\xe2\x80\x94      if , then , you have act in good faith and integrity toward Jerubbaal and his house today , then rejoice in Abimelech and may he in turn rejoice in you !      but if not , let fire come forth from Abimelech and devour the lord of Shechem and Beth - millo , and let fire come forth from the lord of Shechem and Beth - millo and devour Abimelech .      then Jotham flee and escape to Beer , where he remain for fear of his brother Abimelech .     when Abimelech have rule Israel for three year ,      God put an evil spirit    between Abimelech and the lord of Shechem , and the lord of Shechem break faith with the house of Abimelech .      this be to repay the violence do to the seventy son of Jerubbaal and to avenge their blood upon their brother Abimelech , who kill they , and upon the lord of Shechem , who encourage he to kill his brother .      the lord of Shechem then set man in ambush for he on the mountaintop , and they rob all who pass they on the road . it be report to Abimelech .     now Gaal , son of Ebed , and his kin come , and when they pass through Shechem , the lord of Shechem put their trust in he .      they go out into the field , harvest the grape from their vineyard , trod they out , and hold a festival . then they go to the temple of their god , where they eat and drank and curse Abimelech .       Gaal , son of Ebed , say , who be Abimelech ? and who be Shechem that we should serve he ? do not the son of Jerubbaal and his lieutenant Zebul serve the man of Hamor , father of Shechem ?    so why should we serve he ?      would that these troop be entrust to my command ! I would depose Abimelech . I would say to Abimelech , get a large army and come out !     when Zebul , the ruler of the city , hear what Gaal , son of Ebed , have say , he be angry      and send messenger to Abimelech in Arumah to say , Gaal , son of Ebed , and his kin have come to Shechem and be stir up the city against you .      so take action tonight , you and the troop who be with you , and set an ambush in the field .      Promptly at sunrise tomorrow morning , make a raid on the city . when he and the troop who be with he come out against you , deal with he as well you can .     during the night Abimelech go into action with all his soldier and set up an ambush outside of Shechem in four company .      Gaal , son of Ebed , go out and stand at the entrance of the city gate . when Abimelech and his soldier rise from their place of ambush ,      Gaal see the soldier and say to Zebul , there be soldier come down from the mountaintop ! but Zebul answer he , it be the shadow of the hill that you see as man .      but Gaal go on to say , soldier be come down from the region of Tabbur - haarez , and one company be come by way of Elon - meonenim .      Zebul say to he , where now be your boast , when you say , who be Abimelech that we should serve he ? be these not the troop for whom you express contempt ? go out now and fight with they .      so Gaal go out at the head of the lord of Shechem to fight against Abimelech ;      but when Abimelech go after he , he flee from he . many fall slain right up to the entrance of the gate .      Abimelech return to Arumah , and Zebul drive Gaal and his kin away so that they could no long remain at Shechem .     the next day , the army march out into the field , and it be report to Abimelech .      he divide the troop he have into three company , and set up an ambush in the field . he watch until he see the army leave the city and then go on the attack against they .      Abimelech and the company with he rush in and stand by the entrance of the city gate , while the other two company rush upon all who be in the field and attack they .      that entire day Abimelech fight against the city . he capture it , kill the people who be in it , and demolish the city itself , sow it with salt .       when they hear of this , all the lord of the Migdal - shechem go into the crypt of the temple of El - berith .      it be report to Abimelech that all the lord of the Migdal - shechem be gather together .      so he go up Mount Zalmon with all his soldier , take his ax in his hand , and cut down some brushwood . this he lift to his shoulder , then say to the troop with he , hurry ! do just as you have see I do .      so all the soldier likewise cut down brushwood and , follow Abimelech , place it against the crypt . then they set the crypt on fire over they , so that every one of the people of the Migdal - shechem , about a thousand man and woman , perish .     Abimelech proceed to Thebez , encamp , and capture it .      now there be a strong tower in the middle of the city , and all the man and woman and all the lord of the city flee there , shut themselves in and go up to the roof of the tower .      Abimelech come up to the tower and fight against it . when he come close to the entrance of the tower to set it on fire ,      a certain woman cast the upper part of a millstone    down on Abimelechs head , and it fracture his skull .        he immediately call his armor - bearer and say to he , draw your sword and put I to death so they will not say about I , a woman kill he .    so his attendant run he through and he die .      when the Israelites see that Abimelech be dead , they all leave for their home .     thus do God repay the evil that Abimelech have do to his father in kill his seventy brother .      God also bring all the wickedness of the people of Shechem back on their head , for the curse of Jotham , son of Jerubbaal , overtake they .             '
