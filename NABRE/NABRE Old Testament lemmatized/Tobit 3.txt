b '    then sad at heart , I groan and weep aloud . with sob I begin to pray :     Tobits Prayer for Death   you be righteous , Lord ,   and all your deed be just ; all your way be mercy and fidelity ;   you be judge of the world .    and now , Lord , be mindful of I   and look with favor upon I . do not punish I for my sin ,   or for my inadvertent offense ,   or for those of my ancestor .     they sin against you ,    and disobey your commandment . so you hand we over to plunder , captivity , and death ,   to become an object lesson , a byword , and a reproach   in all the nation among whom you scatter we .      yes , your many judgment be right   in deal with I as my sin ,   and those of my ancestor , deserve . for we have neither keep your commandment ,   nor walk in fidelity before you .     so now , deal with I as you please ;   command my life breath to be take from I ,   that I may depart from the face of the earth and become dust . it be well for I to die than to live ,    because I have listen to undeserved reproach ,   and great be the grief within I .     Lord , command that I be release from such anguish ;   let I go to my everlasting abode ;   do not turn your face away from I , Lord . for it be well for I to die   than to endure so much misery in life ,   and to listen to such reproach !    II . Sarahs plight Sarah falsely accuse .      on that very day , at Ecbatana in Media , it so happen that Raguels daughter Sarah also have to listen to reproach from one of her father maid .      for she have be give in marriage to seven husband , but the wicked demon Asmodeus    keep kill they off before they could have intercourse with she , as be prescribe for wife . the maid say to she : you be the one who kill your husband ! look ! you have already be give in marriage to seven husband , but you do not bear the name of a single one of they .      why do you beat we ? because your husband be dead ? go , join they ! may we never see son or daughter of yours !     that day Sarah be sad at heart . she go in tear to an upstairs room in her father house and want to hang herself . but she reconsider , say to herself : no ! may people never reproach my father and say to he , you have only one beloved daughter , but she hang herself because of her misfortune . and thus would I bring my father laden with sorrow in his old age to Hades . it be far well for I not to hang myself , but to beg the Lord that I might die , and no long have to listen to such reproach in my lifetime .      at that same time , with hand outstretche toward the window ,    she implore favor : Sarahs Prayer for death bless be you , merciful God !   bless be your holy and honorable name forever !   may all your work forever bless you .    now to you , Lord , I have turn my face   and have lift up my eye .   bid I to depart from the earth ,   never again to listen to such reproach .     you know , Master , that I be clean   of any defilement with a man .   I have never sully my own name   or my father name in the land of my captivity .    I be my father only daughter ,   and he have no other child to be his heir , nor do he have a kinsman or close relative   whose wife I should wait to become . seven husband of mine have already die .   why then should I live any long ? but if it do not please you , Lord , to take my life ,   look favorably upon I and have pity on I ,   that I may never again listen to such reproach !    an Answer to Prayer .     at that very time , the prayer of both of they be hear in the glorious presence of God .       so Raphael be send to heal they both : to remove the white scale from tobit eye , so that he might again see with his own eye Gods light ; and to give Sarah , the daughter of Raguel , as a wife to Tobiah , the son of Tobit , and to rid she of the wicked demon Asmodeus . for it fall to Tobiahs lot    to claim she before any other who might wish to marry she . at that very moment Tobit turn from the courtyard to his house , and Raguels daughter Sarah come down from the upstairs room .
