b '   Universal Corruption   Roam the street of Jerusalem ,   look about and observe , search through her square ,   to find even one who act justly   and seek honesty ,   and I will pardon she !   they say , as the   Lord   live ,   but in fact they swear falsely .    Lord , do your eye not search for honesty ? you strike they , but they do not flinch ;   you lay they low , but they refuse correction ; they set their face hard than stone ,   and refuse to return .    I think : these be only the lowly ,   they behave foolishly ; for they do not know the way of the   Lord ,   the justice of their God .    let I go to the leader   and speak with they ; for they must know the way of the   Lord ,   the justice of their God . but , one and all , they have break the yoke ,   tear off the harness .    therefore , lion from the forest slay they ,   wolf of the desert ravage they , Leopards keep watch round their city :   all who come out be tear to piece , for their crime be many ,   their rebellion numerous .   why should I pardon you ?   your child have forsake I ,   they swear by god that be no god . I feed they , but they commit adultery ;   to the prostitute house they throng .   they be lustful stallion ,   each neigh after the other wife .    should I not punish they for this?\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord ;   on a nation like this should I not take vengeance ?   climb her terrace , and ravage they ,   destroy they completely . tear away her tendril ,   they do not belong to the   Lord .    for they have openly rebel against I ,   both the house of Israel and the house of Judah\xe2\x80\x94   oracle of the   Lord .    they deny the   Lord ,    say , he be nothing , no evil shall come to we ,   neither sword nor famine shall we see .    the prophet be wind ,   and the word be not with they .   let it be do to they !   therefore , thus say the   Lord , the God of host ,   because you have say this\xe2\x80\x94 See ! I make my word   a fire in your mouth , and this people the wood   that it shall devour!\xe2\x80\x94   Beware ! I will bring against you   a nation from far away ,   O House of Israel\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord ; a long - live nation , an ancient nation ,   a people whose language you do not know ,   whose speech you can not understand .    their quiver be like open grave ;   all of they be warrior .   they will devour your harvest and your bread ,   devour your son and your daughter , devour your sheep and cattle ,   devour your vine and fig tree ; with their sword they will beat down   the fortified city in which you trust .      yet even in those days\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord \xe2\x80\x94i will not completely destroy you .        and when they ask , why have the   Lord   our God do all these thing to we ? say to they , as you have abandon I to serve foreign god in your own land , so shall you serve foreigner in a land not your own .     announce this to the house of Jacob ,   proclaim it in Judah :   pay attention to this ,   you foolish and senseless people , who have eye and do not see ,   who have ear and do not hear .    should you not fear me\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord \xe2\x80\x94   should you not tremble before I ? I make the sandy shore the sea limit ,   which by eternal decree it may not overstep . toss though it may , it be to no avail ;   though its billow roar , they can not overstep .    but this people heart be stubborn and rebellious ;   they turn and go away ,   and do not say in their heart ,   let we fear the   Lord , our God , who give we rain   early and late ,    in its time ; who watch for we   over the appoint week of harvest .    your crime have prevent these thing ,   your sin have turn these blessing away from you .    for criminal lurk among my people ;   like fowler they set trap ,   but it be human being they catch .    their house be as full of treachery   as a bird - cage be of bird ; therefore they grow powerful and rich ,    fat and sleek . they pass over wicked deed ;   justice they do not defend by advance the claim of the orphan   or judge the cause of the poor .    shall I not punish these things?\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord ;   on a nation such as this shall I not take vengeance ?   something shocking and horrible   have happen in the land :   the prophet prophesy falsely ,   and the priest teach on their own authority ; yet my people like it this way ;   what will you do when the end come ?
