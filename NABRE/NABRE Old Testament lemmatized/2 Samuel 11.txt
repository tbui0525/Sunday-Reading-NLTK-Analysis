David himself remain in Jerusalem .        one evening David rise from his bed and stroll about on the roof of the king house . from the roof he see a woman bathe ; she be very beautiful .      David send people to inquire about the woman and be tell , she be Bathsheba , daughter of Eliam , and wife of Uriah the Hittite , Joabs armor - bearer .        then David send messenger and take she . when she come to he , he take she to bed , at a time when she be just purify after her period ; and she return to her house .        but the woman have become pregnant ; she send a message to inform David , I be pregnant .     so David send a message to Joab , send I Uriah the Hittite . Joab send Uriah to David .      and when he come , David ask he how Joab be , how the army be , and how the war be go , and Uriah answer that all be well .      David then say to Uriah , go down to your house and bathe your foot . Uriah leave the king house , and a portion from the king table be send after he .      but Uriah sleep at the entrance of the king house with the other officer of his lord , and do not go down to his own house .      David be tell , Uriah have not go down to his house . so he say to Uriah , have you not come from a journey ? why , then , do you not go down to your house ?      Uriah answer David , the ark and Israel and Judah be stay in tent , and my lord Joab and my lord servant be encamped in the open field . can I go home to eat and to drink and to sleep with my wife ? as the   Lord   live and as you live , I will do no such thing .        then David say to Uriah , stay here today also , and tomorrow I will send you back . so Uriah stay in Jerusalem that day . on the follow day ,      David summon he , and he eat and drink with David , who get he drunk . but in the evening he go out to sleep on his bed among his lord servant , and do not go down to his house .      the next morning David write a letter to Joab which he send by Uriah .      this be what he write in the letter : place Uriah up front , where the fighting be fierce . then pull back and leave he to be strike down dead .      so while Joab be besiege the city , he assign Uriah to a place where he know the defender be strong .      when the man of the city make a sortie against Joab , some officer of Davids army fall , and Uriah the Hittite also die .     then Joab send David a report of all the detail of the battle ,      instruct the messenger , when you have finish give the king all the detail of the battle ,      the king may become angry and say to you : why do you go near the city to fight ? do you not know that they would shoot from the wall above ?      who kill Abimelech , son of Jerubbaal ? be it not a woman who throw a millstone down on he from the wall above , so that he die in Thebez ? why do you go near the wall ? then you in turn be to say , your servant Uriah the Hittite be also dead .        the messenger set out , and on his arrival he report to David everything Joab have send he to tell .        he tell David : the man have the advantage over we and come out into the open against we , but we push they back to the entrance of the city gate .      then the archer shoot at your servant from the wall above , and some of the king servant die ; and your servant Uriah the Hittite be also dead .      David say to the messenger : this be what you shall say to Joab : do not let this be a great evil in your sight , for the sword devour now here and now there . strengthen your attack on the city and destroy it . encourage he .     when the wife of Uriah hear that her husband have die , she mourn her lord .      but once the mourning be over , David send for she and bring she into his house . she become his wife and bear he a son . but in the sight of the   Lord   what David have do be evil .
