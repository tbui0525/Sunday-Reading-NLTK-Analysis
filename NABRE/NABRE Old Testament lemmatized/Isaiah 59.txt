b '   Salvation delay    no , the hand of the   Lord   be not too short to save ,   nor his ear too dull to hear .    rather , it be your crime   that separate you from your God , it be your sin that make he hide his face   so that he do not hear you .   for your hand be defile with blood ,   and your finger with crime ; your lip speak falsehood ,   and your tongue utter deceit .    no one bring suit justly ,   no one plead truthfully ; they trust an empty plea and tell lie ;   they conceive mischief and bring forth malice .    they hatch adder egg ,   and weave spider webs : whoever eat the egg will die ,   if one of they be crush , it will hatch a viper ;    their webs can not serve as clothing ,   nor can they cover themselves with their work . their work be evil work ,   and deed of violence be in their hand .   their foot run to evil ,   and they hasten to shed innocent blood ; their thought be thought of wickedness ,   violence and destruction be on their highway .    the way of peace they know not ,   and there be no justice on their path ; their road they have make crooked ,   no one who walk in they know peace .    Acknowledgment of Transgressions    that be why judgment be far from we   and justice do not reach we . we look for light , but there be darkness ;   for brightness , and we walk in gloom !    like those who be blind we grope along the wall ,   like people without eye we feel our way . we stumble at midday as if at twilight ,   among the vigorous , we be like the dead .   like bear we all growl ,   like dove we moan without cease . we cry out for justice , but it be not there ;   for salvation , but it be far from we .    for our transgression before you be many ,   our sin bear witness against we . our transgression be present to we ,   and our crime we acknowledge :   Transgressing , and deny the   Lord ,   turn back from follow our God , planning fraud and treachery ,   utter lie word conceive in the heart .   Judgment be turn away ,   and justice stand far off ; for truth stumble in the public square ,   and uprightness can not enter .    Fidelity be lack ,   and whoever turn from evil be despoiled . Divine Intervention the   Lord   see this , and be aggrieve   that there be no justice .   he see that there be no one ,   be appal that there be none to intervene ; then his own arm bring about the victory ,   and his justice sustain he .   he put on justice as his breastplate ,   victory as a helmet on his head ; he clothe himself with garment of vengeance ,   wrap himself in a mantle of zeal .    accord to their deed he repay his enemy   and requite his foe with wrath ;   to the coastland he render recompense .   those in the west shall fear the name of the   Lord ,   and those in the east , his glory , come like a pen - up stream   drive on by the breath of the   Lord .   then for Zion shall come a redeemer ,   to those in Jacob who turn from transgression\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord .     this be my covenant with they ,   which I myself have make , say the   Lord : my spirit which be upon you   and my word that I have put in your mouth shall not depart from your mouth ,   nor from the mouth of your child nor the mouth of your children child   from this time forth and forever , say the   Lord .
