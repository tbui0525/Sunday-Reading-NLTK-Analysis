b '   Solomon be like all other   I too be a mortal , the same as all the rest ,    and a descendant of the first one form of earth .   and in my mother womb I be mold into flesh    in a ten - month period   \xe2\x80\x94body and blood ,   from the seed of a man , and the pleasure that accompany marriage .   and I too , when bear , inhale the common air ,   and fall upon the kindred earth ;   wail , I utter that first sound common to all .   in swaddle clothe and with constant care I be nurture .   for no king have any different origin or birth ;    one be the entry into life for all ,   and in one same way they leave it .     Solomon pray and Wisdom and Riches come to he   therefore I pray , and prudence be give I ;   I plead and the spirit of Wisdom come to I .    I prefer she to scepter and throne ,   and deem rich nothing in comparison with she ,    nor do I liken any priceless gem to she ; because all gold , in view of she , be a bit of sand ,   and before she , silver be to be account mire .   beyond health and beauty I love she , and I choose to have she rather than the light ,   because her radiance never cease .    yet all good thing together come to I with she ,    and countless rich at her hand ;   I rejoice in they all , because wisdom be their leader ,   though I have not know that she be their mother .      Solomon Prays for help to speak Worthily of Wisdom   sincerely I learn about she , and ungrudgingly do I share\xe2\x80\x94   her rich I do not hide away ;    for she be an unfailing treasure ;   those who gain this treasure win the friendship of God ,   be commend by the gift that come from her discipline .    now God grant I speak suitably   and value these endowment at their worth : for he be the guide of wisdom   and the director of the wise .   for both we and our word be in his hand ,   as well as all prudence and knowledge of craft .     for he give I sound knowledge of what exist ,   that I might know the structure of the universe and the force of its element ,   the beginning and the end and the midpoint of time ,   the change in the sun course and the variation of the season ,   cycle of year , position of star ,    nature of live thing , temper of beast , power of the wind and thought of human being ,   use of plant and virtue of roots\xe2\x80\x94   whatever be hide or plain I learn ,    for Wisdom , the artisan of all , teach I .   Nature and Incomparable Dignity of wisdom    for in she be a spirit   intelligent , holy , unique , manifold , subtle , agile ,   clear , unstained , certain , never harmful , love the good , keen ,     unhampered , beneficent , kindly , firm , secure , tranquil ,   all - powerful , all - seeing , and pervade all spirit ,   though they be intelligent , pure and very subtle .     for wisdom be mobile beyond all motion ,   and she penetrate and pervade all thing by reason of her purity .     for she be a breath of the might of God   and a pure emanation of the glory of the Almighty ;   therefore nothing defile can enter into she .   for she be the reflection of eternal light ,   the spotless mirror of the power of God ,   the image of his goodness .    although she be one , she can do all thing ,   and she renew everything while herself perdure ; pass into holy soul from age to age ,   she produce friend of God and prophet .    for God love nothing so much as the one who dwell with wisdom .   for she be fair than the sun    and surpass every constellation of the star . compare to light , she be find more radiant ;    though night supplant light ,   wickedness do not prevail over wisdom .
