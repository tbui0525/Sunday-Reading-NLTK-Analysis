Joakim , who be high priest    in Jerusalem in those day , write to the inhabitant of Bethulia and Betomesthaim , which be opposite Esdraelon , face the plain near Dothan ,        and instruct they to keep firm hold of the mountain pass , since these offer access to Judea . it would be easy to stop those advance , as the approach be only wide enough for two at a time .        the Israelites carry out the order give they by Joakim , the high priest , and the senate of the whole people of Israel , in session in Jerusalem .     Israel at Prayer .     all the man of Israel cry to God with great fervor and humble themselves .      they , along with their wife , and child , and domestic animal , every resident alien , hire worker , and purchase slave , gird themselves with sackcloth .         and all the israelite man , woman , and child who live in Jerusalem fall prostrate in front of the temple     and sprinkle ashe on their head , spread out their sackcloth before the Lord .        the altar , too , they drape in sackcloth ;    and with one accord they cry out fervently to the God of Israel not to allow their child to be seize , their wife to be take captive , the city of their inheritance to be ruin , or the sanctuary to be profane and mock for the nation to gloat over .     the Lord hear their cry    and see their distress . the people continue fast for many day throughout Judea and before the sanctuary of the Lord Almighty in Jerusalem .        also gird with sackcloth , Joakim , the high priest , and all the priest in attendance before the Lord , and those who minister to the Lord offer the daily burn offering , the votive offering , and the voluntary offering of the people .        with ashe upon their turban , they cry to the Lord with all their strength to look with favor on the whole house of Israel .
