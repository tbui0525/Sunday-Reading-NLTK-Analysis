b ' the Righteous Israelite    a psalm of David . I Lord , who may abide in your tent ?    who may dwell on your holy mountain ?    II   whoever walk without blame ,    do what be right ,   speak truth from the heart ;   who do not slander with his tongue ,   do no harm to a friend ,   never defame a neighbor ;   who disdain the wicked ,   but honor those who fear the   Lord ;   who keep an oath despite the cost ,    lend no money at interest ,    accept no bribe against the innocent .   III whoever act like this   shall never be shake .             '
