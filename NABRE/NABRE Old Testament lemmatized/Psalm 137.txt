b ' Sorrow and Hope in exile I   by the river of Babylon   there we sit weep   when we remember Zion .    on the poplar in its midst   we hang up our harp .    for there our captor ask we   for the word of a song ; our tormentor , for joy :   sing for we a song of Zion !   but how could we sing a song of the   Lord   in a foreign land ?    II   if I forget you , Jerusalem ,   may my right hand forget .    may my tongue stick to my palate   if I do not remember you , if I do not exalt Jerusalem   beyond all my delight .    III   Remember ,   Lord , against Edom   that day at Jerusalem . they say : level it , level it   down to its foundation !    Desolate Daughter Babylon , you shall be destroy ,   bless the one who pay you back   what you have do we !     bless the one who seize your child   and smash they against the rock .              '
