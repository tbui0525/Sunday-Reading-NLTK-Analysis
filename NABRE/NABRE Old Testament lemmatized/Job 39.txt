b '    do you know when mountain goat be bear ,   or watch for the birth pang of deer ,   Number the month that they must fulfill ,   or know when they give birth ,   when they crouch down and drop their young ,   when they deliver their progeny ?   their offspring thrive and grow in the open ,   they leave and do not return .   who have give the wild donkey his freedom ,   and who have loose the wild ass from bond ?   I have make the wilderness his home   and the salt flat his dwelling .   he scoff at the uproar of the city ,   hear no shout of a driver .   he range the mountain for pasture ,   and seek out every patch of green .   will the wild ox consent to serve you ,   or pass the night at your manger ?   will you bind the wild ox with a rope in the furrow ,   and will he plow the valley after you ?   will you depend on he for his great strength   and leave to he the fruit of your toil ?   can you rely on he to bring in your grain   and gather in the yield of your threshing floor ?   the wing of the ostrich    flap away ;   her plumage be lack in feather .   when she abandon her egg on the ground    and let they warm in the sand ,   she forget that a foot may crush they ,   that the wild beast may trample they ;   she cruelly disown her young   and her labor be useless ; she have no fear .   for God have withhold wisdom from she   and give she no share in understanding .   yet when she spread her wing high ,   she laugh at a horse and rider .   do you give the horse his strength ,    and clothe his neck with a mane ?   do you make he quiver like a locust ,   while his thunderous snorting spread terror ?   he paw the valley , he rejoice in his strength ,   and charge into battle .   he laugh at fear and can not be terrify ;   he do not retreat from the sword .   around he rattle the quiver ,   flash the spear and the javelin .   Frenzied and tremble he devour the ground ;   he do not hold back at the sound of the trumpet ;    at the trumpet call he cry , Aha ! even from afar he scent the battle ,   the roar of the officer and the shouting .   be it by your understanding that the hawk soar ,   that he spread his wing toward the south ?   do the eagle fly up at your command   to build his nest up high ?   on a cliff he dwell and spend the night ,   on the spur of cliff or fortress .   from there he watch for his food ;   his eye behold it afar off .   his young one greedily drink blood ;   where the slain be , there be he .
