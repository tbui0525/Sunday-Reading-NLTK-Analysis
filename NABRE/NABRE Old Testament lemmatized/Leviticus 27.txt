b '    votive Offerings and dedication .     the   Lord   say to Moses :       speak to the Israelites and tell they : when anyone make a vow to the   Lord    with respect to the value of a human being ,      the value for male between the age of twenty and sixty shall be fifty silver shekel , by the sanctuary shekel ;      and for a female , the value shall be thirty shekel .      for person between the age of five and twenty , the value for a male shall be twenty shekel , and for a female , ten shekel .      for person between the age of one month and five year , the value for a male shall be five silver shekel , and for a female , three shekel .      for person of sixty or more , for a male the value shall be fifteen shekel , and ten shekel for a female .      however , if the one who make the vow be too poor to meet the sum ,    the person must be set before the priest , who shall determine a value ; the priest will do this in keep with the mean of the one who make the vow .     if the offering vow to the   Lord   be an animal that may be sacrifice , every such animal give to the   Lord   become sacred .        the offerer shall not substitute or exchange another for it , either a bad or a well one . if the offerer exchange one animal in place of another , both the original and its substitute shall become sacred .      if any unclean animal which be unfit for sacrifice    to the   Lord   be vow , it must be set before the priest ,      who shall determine its value    in keep with its good or bad quality , and the value set by the priest shall stand .      if the offerer wish to redeem the animal , the person shall pay one fifth more than this valuation .       when someone dedicate a house as sacred to the   Lord ,    the priest shall determine its value in keep with its good or bad quality , and the value set by the priest shall stand .      a person dedicate a house who then wish to redeem it shall pay one fifth more than the price thus establish , and then it will again belong to that individual .      if someone dedicate to the   Lord   a portion of hereditary land , its valuation shall be make accord to the amount of seed require to sow it , the acreage sow with a homer    of barley seed be value at fifty silver shekel .      if the dedication of a field be make at the beginning of a jubilee period , the full valuation shall hold ;      but if it be some time after this , the priest shall estimate its money value accord to the number of year leave until the next jubilee year , with a corresponding reduction on the valuation .        a person dedicate a field who then wish to redeem     it shall pay one fifth more than the price thus establish , and so reclaim it .      if , instead of redeem such a field , one sell it    to another , it may no long be redeem ;      but at the jubilee it shall be release    as sacred    to the   Lord ; like a field that be put under the ban , it shall become priestly property .     if someone dedicate to the   Lord   a field that be purchase and be not part of hereditary property ,      the priest shall compute its value in proportion to the number of year until the next jubilee , and on the same day the person shall pay the price thus establish , a sacred donation to the   Lord ;      at the jubilee the field shall revert to the hereditary owner of this land from whom it have be purchase .      every valuation shall be make accord to the standard of the sanctuary shekel . there be twenty gerah to the shekel .    irredeemable Offerings .      note that a firstborn animal ,    which as such already belong to the   Lord , may not be dedicate . whether an ox or a sheep , it be the   Lord s.      but if it be an unclean animal ,    it may be redeem by pay one fifth more than its value . if it be not redeem , it shall be sell at its value .     note , also , that any possession which someone put under the ban    for the   Lord , whether it be a human being , an animal , or a hereditary field , shall be neither sell nor redeem ; everything that be put under the ban become most holy to the   Lord .        all human being that be put under the ban can not be redeem ; they must be put to death .       all tithe of the land , whether in grain from the field or in fruit from the tree , belong to the   Lord ; they be sacred to the   Lord .        if someone wish to redeem any of the tithe , the person shall pay one fifth more than their value .      the tithe of the herd and the flock , every tenth animal that pass under the herdsman rod , shall be sacred to the   Lord .      it shall not matter whether good one or bad one be thus choose , and no exchange may be make . if any exchange be make , both the original animal and its substitute become sacred and can not be redeem .     these be the commandment which the   Lord   give Moses on Mount Sinai for the Israelites .
