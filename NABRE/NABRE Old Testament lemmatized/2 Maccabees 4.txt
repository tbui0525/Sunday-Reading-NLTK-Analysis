b '    Simon accuse Onias .     the Simon mention above as the informer about the fund against his own country slander Onias as the one who incite Heliodorus and instigate the whole miserable affair .      he dare to brand as a schemer against the government the man who be the benefactor of the city , the protector of his compatriot , and a zealous defender of the law .      when Simons hostility reach such a pitch that murder be be commit by one of his henchman ,      Onias see that the opposition be serious and that Apollonius , son of Menestheus , the governor of Coelesyria and Phoenicia , be abet Simons wickedness .      so he have recourse to the king , not as an accuser of his compatriot , but as one look to the general and particular good of all the people .      he see that without royal attention it would be impossible to have a peaceful government , and that Simon would not desist from his folly .    Jason as High Priest .     but Seleucus die ,    and when Antiochus surname Epiphanes succeed he on the throne , Onias brother Jason obtain the high priesthood by corrupt mean :        in an interview , he promise the king three hundred and sixty talent of silver , as well as eighty talent from another source of income .      besides this he would undertake to pay a hundred and fifty more , if he be give authority to establish a gymnasium and a youth center    for it and to enroll Jerusalemites as citizen of Antioch .     when Jason receive the king approval and come into office , he immediately initiate his compatriot into the greek way of life .      he set aside the royal concession grant to the Jews through the mediation of John , father of Eupolemus    ( that Eupolemus who would later go on an embassy to the Romans to establish friendship and alliance with they ) ; he set aside the lawful practice and introduce custom contrary to the law .         with perverse delight he establish a gymnasium    at the very foot of the citadel , where he induce the noble young man to wear the greek hat .      the craze for Hellenism and the adoption of foreign custom reach such a pitch , through the outrageous wickedness of Jason , the renegade and would - be high priest ,      that the priest no long care about the service of the altar . disdain the temple and neglect the sacrifice , they hasten , at the signal for the game , to take part in the unlawful exercise at the arena .      what their ancestor have regard as honor they despise ; what the Greeks esteem as glory they prize highly .      for this reason they find themselves in serious trouble : the very people whose manner of life they emulate , and whom they desire to imitate in everything , become their enemy and oppressor .      it be no light matter to flout the law of God , as subsequent event will show .     when the quinquennial game be hold at Tyre in the presence of the king ,      the vile Jason send representative of the Antiochians of Jerusalem , to bring three hundred silver drachmas for the sacrifice to Hercules . but the bearer themselves decide that the money should not be spend on a sacrifice , as that be not right , but should be use for some other purpose .      so the contribution mean for the sacrifice to Hercules by the sender , be in fact apply to the construction of trireme    by those who bring it .     when Apollonius , son of Menestheus , be send to Egypt for the coronation of King Philometor ,    Antiochus learn from he that the king be oppose to his policy . he take measure for his own security ; so after go to Joppa , he proceed to Jerusalem .      there he be receive with great pomp by Jason and the people of the city , who escort he with torchlights and acclamation ; follow this , he lead his army into Phoenicia .    Menelaus as High Priest .     three year later Jason send Menelaus ,    brother of the aforementioned Simon , to deliver the money to the king , and to complete negotiation on urgent matter .      but after his introduction to the king , he flatter he with such an air of authority that he secure the high priesthood for himself , outbid Jason by three hundred talent of silver .      he return with the royal commission , but with nothing that make he worthy of the high priesthood ; he have the temper of a cruel tyrant and the rage of a wild beast .      so Jason , who have cheat his own brother and now see himself cheat by another man , be drive out as a fugitive to the country of the Ammonites .      but Menelaus , who obtain the office , pay nothing of the money he have promise to the king ,      in spite of the demand of Sostratus , the commandant of the citadel , whose duty it be to collect the taxis . for this reason , both be summon before the king .      Menelaus leave his brother Lysimachus as his deputy in the high priesthood , while Sostratus leave Crates , commander of the Cypriots .     murder of Onias .     while these thing be take place , the people of Tarsus and Mallus    rise in revolt , because their city have be give as a gift to Antiochis , the king concubine .      so the king hasten off to settle the affair , leave Andronicus , one of his noble , as his deputy .      Menelaus , for his part , think this a good opportunity , steal some gold vessel from the temple and present they to Andronicus ; he have already sell other vessel in Tyre and in the neighboring city .      when Onias have clear evidence , he accuse Menelaus publicly , after withdraw to the inviolable sanctuary at Daphne , near Antioch .      thereupon Menelaus approach Andronicus privately and urge he to seize Onias . so Andronicus go to Onias , treacherously reassure he by offer his right hand in oath , and persuade he , in spite of his suspicion , to leave the sanctuary . then , with no regard for justice , he immediately put he to death .     as a result , not only the Jews , but many people of other nation as well , be indignant and angry over the unjust murder of the man .      when the king return from the region of Cilicia , the Jews of the city ,    together with the Greeks who detest the crime , go to see he about the murder of Onias .      Antiochus be deeply grieve and full of pity ; he weep as he recall the prudence and noble conduct of the deceased .      inflame with anger , he immediately strip Andronicus of his purple robe , tear off his garment , and have he lead through the whole city to the very place where he have commit the outrage against Onias ; and there he put the murderer to death . thus the Lord render he the punishment he deserve .    More Outrages .     many act of sacrilege have be commit by Lysimachus in the city    with the connivance of Menelaus . when word spread , the people assemble in protest against Lysimachus , because a large number of gold vessel have be steal .      as the crowd , now thoroughly enrage , begin to riot , Lysimachus launch an unjustified attack against they with about three thousand armed man under the leadership of a certain Auranus , a man as advanced in folly as he be in year .      see Lysimachus attack , people pick up stone , piece of wood or handfuls of the ashe lie there and throw they in wild confusion at Lysimachus and his man .      as a result , they wound many of they and even kill a few , while they put all to flight . the temple robber himself they kill near the treasury .     charge about this affair be bring against Menelaus .      when the king come to Tyre , three man send by the senate plead the case before he .      but Menelaus , see himself on the lose side , promise Ptolemy , son of Dorymenes , a substantial sum of money if he would win the king over .        so Ptolemy take the king aside into a colonnade , as if to get some fresh air , and persuade he to change his mind .      Menelaus , who be the cause of all the trouble , the king acquit of the charge , while he condemn to death those poor man who would have be declare innocent even if they have plead their case before Scythians .      thus , those who have prosecute the case on behalf of the city , the people , and the sacred vessel , quickly suffer unjust punishment .      for this reason , even Tyrians , detest the crime , provide sumptuously for their burial .      but Menelaus , thank to the greed of those in power , remain in office , where he grow in wickedness , scheme greatly against his fellow citizen .
