b '   end of Hezekiahs Reign .      in those day , when Hezekiah be mortally ill , the prophet Isaiah , son of Amoz , come and say to he : thus say the   Lord : put your house in order , for you be about to die ; you shall not recover .      he turn his face to the wall and pray to the   Lord :      ah ,   Lord , remember how faithfully and wholeheartedly I conduct myself in your presence , do what be good in your sight ! and Hezekiah weep bitterly .      before Isaiah have leave the central courtyard , the word of the   Lord   come to he :      go back and tell Hezekiah , the leader of my people : thus say the   Lord , the God of David your father : I have hear your prayer ;   I have see your tear .   now I be heal you . on the third day you shall go up   to the house of the   Lord .   I will add to your life fifteen year .   I will rescue you and this city   from the hand of the king of Assyria ; I will be a shield to this city   for my own sake and the sake of David my servant .     then Isaiah say , bring a poultice of fig and apply it to the boil for his recovery .      Hezekiah ask Isaiah , what be the sign that the   Lord   will heal I and that I shall go up to the house of the   Lord   on the third day ?      Isaiah reply , this will be the sign for you from the   Lord   that he will carry out the word he have speak : shall the shadow go forward or back ten step ?      it be easy for the shadow to advance ten step , Hezekiah answer . rather , let it go back ten step .      so Isaiah the prophet invoke the   Lord . he make the shadow go back the ten step it have descend on the staircase to the terrace of Ahaz .     at that time , Berodach - baladan ,    son of Baladan , king of Babylon , send letter and gift to Hezekiah when he hear that he have be ill .      Hezekiah listen to the envoy and then show off his whole treasury : his silver , gold , spice and perfumed oil , his armory , and everything in his storeroom ; there be nothing in his house or in all his realm that Hezekiah do not show they .      then Isaiah the prophet come to King Hezekiah and ask he : what do these man say to you ? where do they come from ? Hezekiah reply , they come from a distant land , from Babylon .      he ask , what do they see in your house ? Hezekiah answer , they see everything in my house . there be nothing in my storeroom that I do not show they .      then Isaiah say to Hezekiah : hear the word of the   Lord :      the time be come when all that be in your house , everything that your ancestor have store up until this day , shall be carry off to Babylon ; nothing shall be leave , say the   Lord .      some of your own descendant , your offspring , your progeny , shall be take and make attendant in the palace of the king of Babylon .      Hezekiah reply to Isaiah , the word of the   Lord   which you have speak be good . for he think , there will be peace and stability in my lifetime .     the rest of the act of Hezekiah , with all his valor , and how he construct the pool and conduit    and bring water into the city , be record in the book of the chronicle of the king of Judah .        Hezekiah rest with his ancestor , and his son Manasseh succeed he as king .             '
