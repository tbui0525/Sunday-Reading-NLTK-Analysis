b '     Lord   Almighty , God of Israel , the anguished soul , the dismayed spirit cry out to you .      hear ,   Lord , and have mercy , for you be a merciful God ; have mercy on we , who have sin against you :      for you be enthrone forever , while we be perish forever .        Lord   Almighty , God of Israel , hear the prayer of the dead of Israel , child who sin against you ; they do not listen to the voice of the   Lord , their God , and their evil cling to we .        do not remember the wicked deed of our ancestor , but remember at this time your power and your name ,      for you be the   Lord   our God ; and you ,   Lord , we will praise !      this be why you put into our heart the fear of you : that we may call upon your name , and praise you in our exile , when we have remove from our heart all the wickedness of our ancestor who sin against you .        see , today we be in exile , where you have scatter we , an object of reproach and cursing and punishment for all the wicked deed of our ancestor , who withdraw from the   Lord , our God .    A. Importance of Wisdom   Hear , Israel , the commandment of life :   listen , and know prudence !    how be it , Israel ,   that you be in the land of your foe ,   grow old in a foreign land ,   defile with the dead ,   count among those destine for Hades ?    you have forsake the fountain of wisdom !     have you walk in the way of God ,   you would have dwelt in endure peace .      learn where prudence be ,   where strength , where understanding ; that you may know also   where be length of day , and life ,   where light of the eye , and peace .    who have find the place of wisdom ?    who have enter into her treasury ?   where be the ruler of the nation ,   who lord it over the wild beast of the earth ,     make sport of the bird in the heaven , who heap up the silver ,   the gold in which people trust ,   whose possession be unlimited ,   who scheme anxiously for money ,   their doing beyond discovery ?   they have vanish , go down to Hades ,   and other have rise up in their stead .   later generation have see the light of day ,   have dwelt on the earth , but the way to understanding they have not know ,    they have not perceive her path or reach she ;   their child remain far from the way to she .   she have not be hear of in Canaan ,    nor see in Teman .    the descendant of Hagar who seek knowledge on earth ,   the merchant of Medan and Tema ,    the storyteller and those seek knowledge\xe2\x80\x94 these have not know the way to wisdom ,   nor have they keep her path in mind .    B. Inaccessibility of Wisdom   o Israel , how vast be the dwelling of God ,    how broad the scope of his dominion :   vast and endless ,   high and immeasurable !   in it be bear the giant ,    renowned at the first ,   huge in stature , skilled in war .    these God do not choose ,   nor do he give they the way of understanding ;    they perish for lack of prudence ,   perish through their own folly .      who have go up to the heaven and take she ,   bring she down from the cloud ?    who have cross the sea and find she ,   bear she away rather than choice gold ?   none know the way to she ,   nor have at heart her path .   but the one who know all thing know she ;   he have probe she by his knowledge\xe2\x80\x94 the one who establish the earth for all time ,   and fill it with four - footed animal ,   who send out the lightning , and it go ,   call it , and tremble it obey he ;   before whom the star at their post   shine and rejoice .   when he call they , they answer , here we be !   shine with joy for their maker .    such be our God ;   no other be to be compare to he :    C. Wisdom contain in the Law    he have uncover the whole way of understanding ,   and have give she to Jacob , his servant ,   to Israel , his beloved .      thus she have appear on earth ,   be at home with mortal .
