b '   Jobs Second Reply .     then Job answer and say :     I know well that it be so ;   but how can anyone be in the right before God ?   should one wish to contend with he ,    he could not answer he once in a thousand time .   God be wise in heart and mighty in strength ;   who have withstand he and remain whole ?   he remove the mountain before they know it ;   he overturn they in his anger .   he shake the earth out of its place ,    and the pillar beneath it tremble .   he command the sun , and it do not rise ;   he seal up the star .   he alone stretch out the heaven    and tread upon the back of the sea .   he make the Bear and Orion ,   the Pleiades and the constellation of the south ;   he do thing great and unsearchable ,   thing marvelous and innumerable .   should he come near I , I do not see he ;   should he pass by , I be not aware of he ;   should he seize I forcibly , who can resist ?   who can say to he , what be you do ?   he be God and he do not relent ;   the helper of Rahab    bow beneath he .   how then could I give he any answer ,   or choose out argument against he !   even though I be right , I could not answer ,    but should rather beg for what be due I .   if I appeal to he and he answer I ,   I could not believe that he would listen to I ;   with a storm he might overwhelm I ,   and multiply my wound for nothing ;   he would not allow I to draw breath ,   but might fill I with bitter grief .   if it be a question of strength , he be mighty ;   or of judgment , who will call he to account ?   though I be right , my own mouth might condemn I ;    be I innocent , it might put I in the wrong .   I be innocent , but I can not know it ;   I despise my life .   it be all one ! therefore I say :   both the innocent and the wicked he destroy .    when the scourge slay suddenly ,   he scoff at the despair of the innocent .   the earth be give into the hand of the wicked ;   he cover the face of its judge .   if it be not he , who then be it ?   my day be swift than a runner ,   they flee away ; they see no happiness ;    they shoot by like skiff of reed ,   like an eagle swoop upon its prey .   if I say : I will forget my complaining ,   I will lay aside my sadness and be of good cheer ,   then I be in dread of all my pain ;   I know that you    will not hold I innocent .   it be I who will be account guilty ;   why then should I strive in vain ?   if I should wash myself with soap   and cleanse my hand with lye ,   yet you would plunge I in the ditch ,   so that my garment would abhor I .   for he be not a man like myself , that I should answer he ,   that we should come together in judgment .   would that there be an arbiter between we ,   who could lay his hand upon we both    and withdraw his rod from I , so that his terror do not frighten I ;    that I might speak without be afraid of he . since this be not the case with I ,     I loathe my life .
