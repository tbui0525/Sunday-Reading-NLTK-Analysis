I be with you wherever you go , and I cut down all your enemy before you . I will make your name like that of the great on the earth .      I will assign a place for my people Israel and I will plant they in it to dwell there ; they will never again be disturb , nor shall the wicked ever again oppress they , as they do at the beginning ,      and during all the time when I appoint judge over my people Israel . and I will subdue all your enemy . moreover , I declare to you that the   Lord   will build you a house :      when your day have be complete and you must join your ancestor , I will raise up your offspring after you who will be one of your own son , and I will establish his kingdom .        he it be who shall build I a house , and I will establish his throne forever .        I will be a father to he , and he shall be a son to I , and I will not withdraw my favor from he as I withdraw it from the one who be before you ;        but I will maintain he in my house and in my kingdom forever , and his throne shall be firmly establish forever .     in accordance with all these word and this whole vision Nathan speak to David .
