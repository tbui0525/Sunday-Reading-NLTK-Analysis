b '   the Passover Ritual Prescribed .      the   Lord   say to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt :       this month will stand at the head of your calendar ; you will reckon it the first month of the year .        tell the whole community of Israel : on the tenth of this month every family must procure for itself a lamb , one apiece for each household .      if a household be too small for a lamb , it along with its near neighbor will procure one , and apportion the lamb cost    in proportion to the number of person , accord to what each household consume .      your lamb must be a year - old male and without blemish . you may take it from either the sheep or the goat .      you will keep it until the fourteenth day of this month , and then , with the whole community of Israel assemble , it will be slaughter during the evening twilight .      they will take some of its blood and apply it to the two doorpost and the lintel of the house in which they eat it .      they will consume its meat that same night , eat it roast with unleavened bread and bitter herb .      do not eat any of it raw or even boil in water , but roast , with its head and shank and inner organ .      you must not keep any of it beyond the morning ; whatever be leave over in the morning must be burn up .     this be how you be to eat it : with your loin girt , sandal on your foot and your staff in hand , you will eat it in a hurry . it be the   Lord s Passover .      for on this same night I will go through Egypt , strike down every firstborn in the land , human being and beast alike , and execute judgment on all the god of Egypt\xe2\x80\x94I , the   Lord !        but for you the blood will mark the house where you be . see the blood , I will pass over you ; thereby , when I strike the land of Egypt , no destructive blow will come upon you .      this day will be a day of remembrance for you , which your future generation will celebrate with pilgrimage to the   Lord ; you will celebrate it as a statute forever .      for seven day you must eat unleavened bread . from the very first day you will have your house clear of all leaven . for whoever eat leaven bread from the first day to the seventh will be cut off    from Israel .      on the first day you will hold a sacred assembly , and likewise on the seventh . on these day no sort of work shall be do , except to prepare the food that everyone need .      keep , then , the custom of the unleavened bread ,    since it be on this very day that I bring your army out of the land of Egypt . you must observe this day throughout your generation as a statute forever .      from the evening of the fourteenth day of the first month until the evening of the twenty - first day of this month you will eat unleavened bread .      for seven day no leaven may be find in your house ; for anyone , a resident alien or a native , who eat leaven food will be cut off from the community of Israel .      you shall eat nothing leaven ; wherever you dwell you may eat only unleavened bread .    promulgation of the Passover .     Moses summon all the elder of Israel and say to they , go and procure lamb for your family , and slaughter the Passover victim .       then take a bunch of hyssop ,    and dip it in the blood that be in the basin , apply some of this blood to the lintel and the two doorpost . and none of you shall go outdoors until morning .      for when the   Lord   go by to strike down the Egyptians , see the blood on the lintel and the two doorpost , the   Lord   will pass over that door and not let the destroyer come into your house to strike you down .     you will keep this practice forever as a statute for yourself and your descendant .      thus , when you have enter the land which the   Lord   will give you as he promise , you must observe this rite .       when your child ask you , what do this rite of yours mean ?      you will reply , it be the Passover sacrifice for the   Lord , who pass over the house of the Israelites in Egypt ; when he strike down the Egyptians , he deliver our house . then the people kneel and bow down ,      and the Israelites go and do exactly as the   Lord   have command Moses and Aaron .    death of the Firstborn .      and so at midnight the   Lord   strike down every firstborn in the land of Egypt , from the firstborn of Pharaoh sit on his throne to the firstborn of the prisoner in the dungeon , as well as all the firstborn of the animal .      Pharaoh arise in the night , he and all his servant and all the Egyptians ; and there be loud wail throughout Egypt , for there be not a house without its dead .    permission to Depart .     during the night Pharaoh summon Moses and Aaron and say , leave my people at once , you and the Israelites ! go and serve the   Lord   as you say .      take your flock , too , and your herd , as you say , and go ; and bless I , too !      the Egyptians , in a hurry to send they away from the land , urge the people on , for they say , all of we will die !      the people , therefore , take their dough before it be leaven , in their knead bowl wrap in their cloak on their shoulder .       and the Israelites do as Moses have command : they ask the Egyptians for article of silver and gold and for clothing .      indeed the   Lord   have make the Egyptians so well - dispose toward the people that they let they have whatever they ask for . and so they despoil the Egyptians .    Departure from Egypt .     the Israelites set out from Rameses    for Succoth , about six hundred thousand man on foot , not count the child .      a crowd of mix ancestry    also go up with they , with livestock in great abundance , both flock and herd .      the dough they have bring out of Egypt they bake into unleavened loaf . it be not leaven , because they have be drive out of Egypt and could not wait . they do not even prepare food for the journey .     the time the Israelites have stay in Egypt    be four hundred and thirty year .        at the end of four hundred and thirty year , on this very date , all the army of the   Lord   leave the land of Egypt .      this be a night of vigil for the   Lord , when he bring they out of the land of Egypt ; so on this night all Israelites must keep a vigil for the   Lord   throughout their generation .    Law of the Passover .     the   Lord   say to Moses and Aaron : this be the Passover statute . no foreigner may eat of it .      however , every slave buy for money you will circumcise ; then he may eat of it .      but no tenant or hire worker may eat of it .      it must be eat in one house ; you may not take any of its meat outside the house .    you shall not break any of its bone .        the whole community of Israel must celebrate this feast .      if any alien    reside among you would celebrate the Passover for the   Lord , all his male must be circumcise , and then he may join in its celebration just like the native . but no one who be uncircumcised may eat of it .      there will be one law    for the native and for the alien reside among you .     all the Israelites do exactly as the   Lord   have command Moses and Aaron .      on that same day the   Lord   bring the Israelites out of the land of Egypt company by company .
