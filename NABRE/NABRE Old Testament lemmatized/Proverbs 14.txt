b '    Wisdom build her house ,   but Folly tear hers down with her own hand .    those who walk uprightly fear the   Lord ,   but those who be devious in their way spurn he .   in the mouth of the fool be a rod for pride ,   but the lip of the wise preserve they .   where there be no oxen , the crib be clean ;   but abundant crop come through the strength of the bull .    a trustworthy witness do not lie ,   but one who spout lie make a lie witness .     the scoffer seek wisdom in vain ,   but knowledge be easy for the intelligent .   go from the face of the fool ;   you get no knowledge from such lip .   the wisdom of the shrewd enlighten their way ,   but the folly of fool be deceit .    the wicked scorn a guilt offering ,   but the upright find acceptance .   the heart know its own bitterness ,   and its joy no stranger share .    the house of the wicked will be destroy ,   but the tent of the upright will flourish .     sometimes a way seem right ,   but the end of it lead to death !    even in laughter the heart may be sad ,   and the end of joy may be sorrow .   from their own way turncoat be sate ,   from their own action , the loyal .   the naive believe everything ,   but the shrewd watch their step .    the wise person be cautious and turn from evil ;   the fool be reckless and get embroil .   the quick - temper make fool of themselves ,   and schemer be hate .   the simple have folly as an adornment ,   but the shrewd wear knowledge as a crown .    the malicious bow down before the good ,   and the wicked , at the gate of the just .   even by their neighbor the poor be despise ,   but a rich person friend be many .    whoever despise the hungry come up short ,   but happy the one who be kind to the poor !    do not those who plan evil go astray ?   but those who plan good win steadfast loyalty .   in all labor there be profit ,   but mere talk tend only to loss .   the crown of the wise be wealth ;   the diadem of fool be folly .   the truthful witness save life ,   but whoever utter lie be a betrayer .   the fear of the   Lord   be a strong defense ,   a refuge even for one child .   the fear of the   Lord   be a fountain of life ,   turn one from the snare of death .   a multitude of subject be the glory of the king ;   but if his people be few , a prince be ruin .   long - suffer result in great wisdom ;   a short temper raise folly high .     a tranquil mind give life to the body ,   but jealousy rot the bone .   those who oppress the poor revile their maker ,   but those who be kind to the needy honor he .    the wicked be overthrow by their wickedness ,   but the just find a refuge in their integrity .   Wisdom can remain silent in the discern heart ,   but among fool she must make herself know .     Justice exalt a nation ,   but sin be a people disgrace .    the king favor the skillful servant ,   but the shameless one incur his wrath .             '
