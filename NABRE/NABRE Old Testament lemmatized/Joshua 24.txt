b '   Covenant Ceremony .      Joshua gather together all the tribe of Israel at Shechem , summon the elder , leader , judge , and officer of Israel . when they stand in rank before God ,      Joshua address all the people : thus say the   Lord , the God of Israel : in time past your ancestor , down to Terah ,    father of Abraham and Nahor , live beyond the River    and serve other god .      but I bring your father Abraham from the region beyond the River and lead he through the entire land of Canaan .    I make his descendant numerous , and give he Isaac .      to Isaac I give Jacob and Esau .    to Esau I assign the mountain region of Seir to possess , while Jacob and his child go down to Egypt .     then I send Moses and Aaron , and strike Egypt with the plague and wonder that I work in her midst .    afterward I lead you out .      and when I lead your ancestor out of Egypt , you come to the sea , and the Egyptians pursue your ancestor to the Red Sea with chariot and charioteer .        when they cry out to the   Lord ,    he put darkness between you and the Egyptians , upon whom he bring the sea so that it cover they . your eye see what I do to Egypt . after you dwelt a long time in the wilderness ,       I bring you into the land of the Amorites who live east of the Jordan . they fight against you , but I deliver they into your power . you take possession of their land , and I destroy they at your approach .       then Balak , son of Zippor , king of Moab , prepare to war against Israel . he summon Balaam , son of Beor , to curse you ,       but I would not listen to Balaam . instead , he have to bless you , and I deliver you from his power .      once you cross the Jordan    and come to Jericho , the citizen of Jericho fight against you , but I deliver they also into your power .      and I send the hornet    ahead of you which drive them\xe2\x80\x94the Amorites , Perizzites , Canaanites , Hittites , Girgashites , Hivites , and jebusites\xe2\x80\x94out of your way ; it be not your sword or your bow .        I give you a land you do not till and city you do not build , to dwell in ; you eat of vineyard and olive grove you do not plant .       now , therefore , fear the   Lord   and serve he completely and sincerely . cast out the god your ancestor serve beyond the River and in Egypt , and serve the   Lord .       if it be displease to you to serve the   Lord , choose today whom you will serve , the god your ancestor serve beyond the River or the god of the Amorites in whose country you be dwell . as for I and my household , we will serve the   Lord .     but the people answer , far be it from we to forsake the   Lord   to serve other god .      for it be the   Lord , our God , who bring we and our ancestor up out of the land of Egypt , out of the house of slavery . he perform those great sign before our very eye and protect we along our entire journey and among all the people through whom we pass .      at our approach the   Lord   drive out all the people , include the Amorites who dwelt in the land . therefore we also will serve the   Lord , for he be our God .     Joshua in turn say to the people , you may not be able to serve the   Lord , for he be a holy God ; he be a passionate God    who will not forgive your transgression or your sin .      if you forsake the   Lord   and serve strange god , he will then do evil to you and destroy you , after having do you good .     but the people answer Joshua , no ! we will serve the   Lord .      Joshua therefore say to the people , you be witness against yourself that you have choose to serve the   Lord . they reply , we be witness !      now , therefore , put away the foreign god that be among you and turn your heart to the   Lord , the God of Israel .      then the people promise Joshua , we will serve the   Lord , our God , and will listen to his voice .     so Joshua make a covenant with the people that day and make statute and ordinance for they at Shechem .      Joshua write these word in the book of the law of God . then he take a large stone and set it up there under the terebinth that be in the sanctuary of the   Lord .        and Joshua say to all the people , this stone shall be our witness ,    for it have hear all the word which the   Lord   speak to we . it shall be a witness against you , should you wish to deny your God .      then Joshua dismiss the people , each to their own heritage .     death of Joshua .      after these event , Joshua , son of Nun , servant of the   Lord , die at the age of a hundred and ten ,      and they bury he within the border of his heritage at Timnath - serah    in the mountain region of Ephraim north of Mount Gaash .        Israel serve the   Lord   during the entire lifetime of Joshua , and of those elder who outlive Joshua and who know all the work the   Lord   have do for Israel .       the bone of Joseph ,    which the Israelites have bring up from Egypt , be bury in Shechem in the plot of ground Jacob have buy from the son of Hamor , father of Shechem , for a hundred piece of money . this be a heritage of the descendant of Joseph .      when Eleazar , son of Aaron , also die , he be bury on the hill which have be give to his son Phinehas    in the mountain region of Ephraim .
