b '   Second Passover .     the   Lord   say to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai , in the first month of the second year follow their departure from the land of Egypt :      tell the Israelites to celebrate the Passover at the prescribed time .      in the evening twilight of the fourteenth day of this month    you shall celebrate it at its prescribed time , in accord with all its statute and regulation .      so Moses tell the Israelites to celebrate the Passover ,      and they do celebrate the Passover on the fourteenth day of the first month during the evening twilight in the wilderness of Sinai . just as the   Lord   have command Moses , so the Israelites do .     there be some , however , who be unclean because of a human corpse and so could not celebrate the Passover that day . these man come up to Moses and Aaron that same day      and they say to they , although we be unclean because of a human corpse , why should we be deprive of present the   Lord s offering at its prescribed time along with other Israelites ?      Moses answer they , wait so that I can learn what the   Lord   will command in your regard .     the   Lord   then say to Moses :      speak to the Israelites : if any one of you or of your descendant be unclean because of a human corpse , or be absent on a journey , you may still celebrate the   Lord s Passover .      but you shall celebrate it in the second month ,    on the fourteenth day of that month during the evening twilight , eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herb ,      and not leave any of it over till morning , nor break any of its bone ,    but observe all the statute of the Passover .      however , anyone who be clean and not away on a journey , who yet fail to celebrate the Passover , shall be cut off from the people , for not present the   Lord s offering at the prescribed time . that person shall bear the consequence of this sin .     if an alien    who live among you would celebrate the   Lord s Passover , it shall be celebrate accord to the statute and regulation for the Passover . you shall have the same law for the resident alien as for the native of the land .     the Fiery Cloud .     on the day when the tabernacle be erect , the cloud    cover the tabernacle , the tent of the covenant ; but from evening until morning it take on the appearance of fire over the tabernacle .        it be always so : during the day the cloud cover the tabernacle and at night have the appearance of fire .      whenever the cloud rise from the tent , the Israelites would break camp ; wherever the cloud settle , the Israelites would pitch camp .        at the direction of the   Lord   the Israelites break camp , and at the   Lord s direction they pitch camp .    as long as the cloud stay over the tabernacle , they remain in camp .     even when the cloud linger many day over the tabernacle , the Israelites keep the charge of the   Lord   and would not move on .      yet if it happen the cloud be over the tabernacle only for a few day , at the direction of the   Lord   they stay in camp ; and at the   Lord s direction they break camp .      if it happen the cloud remain there only from evening until morning , when the cloud rise in the morning , they would break camp . whether the cloud lift during the day or the night they would then break camp .      whether the cloud linger over the tabernacle for two day or for a month or long , the Israelites remain in camp and do not break camp ; but when it lift , they break camp .      at the direction of the   Lord   they pitch camp , and at the   Lord s direction they break camp ; they keep the charge of the   Lord , as the   Lord   direct they through Moses .
