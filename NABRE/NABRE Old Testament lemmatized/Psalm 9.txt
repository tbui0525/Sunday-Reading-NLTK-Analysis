b ' Thanksgiving for victory and Prayer for Justice   for the leader ; accord to   Muth Labben .    a psalm of David .    I   I will praise you ,   Lord , with all my heart ;   I will declare all your wondrous deed .   I will delight and rejoice in you ;   I will sing hymn to your name , most high .   when my enemy turn back ,   they stumble and perish before you .    II   for you uphold my right and my cause ,   seat on your throne , judge justly .   you rebuke the nation , you destroy the wicked ;   their name you blot out for all time .    the enemy have be ruin forever ;   you destroy their city ;   their memory have perish .    III   the   Lord   rule forever ,   have set up his throne for judgment .   it be he who judge the world with justice ,    who judge the people with fairness .   the   Lord   be a stronghold for the oppressed ,   a stronghold in time of trouble .    those who know your name trust in you ;   you never forsake those who seek you ,   Lord .    IV   sing hymn to the   Lord   enthrone on Zion ;   proclaim his deed among the nation !   for the avenger of bloodshed remember ,   do not forget the cry of the afflict .     v   be gracious to I ,   Lord ;   see how my foe afflict I !   you alone can raise I from the gate of death .    then I will declare all your praise ,   sing joyously of your salvation   in the gate of daughter Zion .     VI   the nation fall into the pit they dig ;   in the snare they hide , their own foot be catch .    the   Lord   be reveal in make judgment :   by the deed they do the wicked be trap .   Higgaion . Selah    VII   to sheol the wicked will depart ,   all the nation that forget God .   for the needy will never be forget ,   nor will the hope of the afflict ever fade .    Arise ,   Lord , let no mortal prevail ;   let the nation be judge in your presence .   strike they with terror ,   Lord ;   show the nation they be only human . Selah             '
