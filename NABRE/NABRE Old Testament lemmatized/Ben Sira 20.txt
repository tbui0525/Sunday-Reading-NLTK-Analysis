b '   Conduct of the Wise and the Foolish   there be an admonition that be untimely ,    but the silent person be the wise one .   it be much well to admonish than to lose one temper ;    one who admit a fault will be keep from disgrace .   like a eunuch lust to violate a young woman   be the one who do right under compulsion .    one be silent and be think wise ;   another , for be talkative , be dislike .   one be silent , have nothing to say ;   another be silent , bide his time .    the wise remain silent till the right time come ,   but a boast fool miss the proper time .   whoever talk too much be detest ;   whoever pretend to authority be hate .     there be the misfortune that bring success ;    and there be the gain that turn into loss .   there be the gift that profit you nothing ,   and there be the gift that must be pay back double .   there be the loss for the sake of glory ,   and there be the one who rise above humble circumstance .   there be one who buy much for little ,   but pay for it seven time over .   the wise make themselves belove by a few word ,   but the courtesy of fool be waste .   a gift from a fool will do you no good ,   for in his eye this one gift be equal to many .   he give little , criticize often ,   and open his mouth like a town crier . he lend today and ask for it tomorrow ;   such a person be hateful .   a fool say , I have no friend   nor thank for my generosity . those who eat his bread have a mock tongue .   how many will ridicule he , and how often !     a slip on the floor be well than a slip of the tongue ;    in like manner the downfall of the wicked come quickly .   a coarse person , an untimely story ;   the ignorant be always ready to offer it .   a proverb speak by a fool be unwelcome ,   for he do not tell it at the proper time .     there be a person whose poverty prevent he from sin ,   but when he take his rest he have no regret .   there be a person who be destroy through shame ,   and ruin by foolish posturing .   there be one who promise a friend out of shame ,   and so make an enemy needlessly .     a lie be a foul blot in a person ,   yet it be always on the lip of the ignorant .   a thief be well than an inveterate liar ,   yet both will suffer ruin .   a liar way lead to dishonor ,   and his shame remain ever with he .     the wise gain promotion with few word ,    the prudent please the great .   those who work the land have abundant crop ,   and those who please the great be pardon their fault .   favor and gift blind the eye ;   like a muzzle over the mouth they silence reproofs .    hide wisdom and unseen treasure\xe2\x80\x94   what value have either ?   well be those who hide their folly   than those who hide their wisdom .
