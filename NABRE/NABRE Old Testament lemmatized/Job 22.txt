b '   Eliphazs Third Speech .     then Eliphaz the Temanite answer and say :     can a man be profitable to God ?    can a wise man be profitable to he ?   do it please the Almighty that you be just ?    do he gain if your way be perfect ?    be it because of your piety that he reprove you\xe2\x80\x94   that he enter into judgment with you ?   be not your wickedness great ,   your iniquity endless ?   you keep your relative good in pledge unjustly ,    leave they strip naked of their clothing .    to the thirsty you give no water to drink ,   and from the hungry you withhold bread ;   as if the land belong to the powerful ,   and only the privileged could dwell in it !   you send widow away empty - handed ,   and the resource of orphan be destroy .    therefore snare be round about you ,    sudden terror make you panic ,   or darkness\xe2\x80\x94you can not see !   a deluge of water cover you .   do not God , in the height of the heavens ,    behold the top of the star , high though they be ?   yet you say , what do God know ?    can he judge through the thick darkness ?   cloud hide he so that he can not see   as he walk around the circuit of the heavens !   do you indeed keep to the ancient way   tread by the worthless ?   they be snatch before their time ;   their foundation a river sweep away .   they say to God , let we alone !   and , what can the Almighty do to we ?   yet he have fill their house with good thing .   the design of the wicked be far from I !     the just look on and be glad ,   and the innocent deride they :     truly our enemy be destroy ,   and what be leave to they , fire have consume !   settle with he and have peace .   that way good shall come to you :   receive instruction from his mouth ,   and place his word in your heart .   if you return to the Almighty , you will be restore ;   if you put iniquity far from your tent ,   and treat raw gold as dust ,   the fine gold of Ophir    as pebble in the wadi ,   then the Almighty himself shall be your gold   and your sparkling silver .   for then you shall delight in the Almighty ,   you shall lift up your face toward God .   entreat he and he will hear you ,    and your vow you shall fulfill .   what you decide shall succeed for you ,   and upon your way light shall shine .   for when they be bring low , you will say , it be pride !   but downcast eye he save .    he will deliver whoever be innocent ;   you shall be deliver if your hand be clean .
