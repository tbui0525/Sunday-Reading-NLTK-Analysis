b '   Trust in God   my child , when you come to serve the Lord ,    prepare yourself for trial .    be sincere of heart and steadfast ,   and do not be impetuous in time of adversity .   cle to he , do not leave he ,   that you may prosper in your last day .     accept whatever happen to you ;   in period of humiliation be patient .   for in fire gold be test ,   and the choose , in the crucible of humiliation .    Trust in God , and he will help you ;   make your way straight and hope in he .     you that fear the Lord , wait for his mercy ,   do not stray lest you fall .   you that fear the Lord , trust in he ,   and your reward will not be lose .   you that fear the Lord , hope for good thing ,   for last joy and mercy .     consider the generation long past and see :   have anyone trust in the Lord and be disappoint ? have anyone persevere in his fear and be forsake ?   have anyone call upon he and be ignore ?    for the Lord be compassionate and merciful ;   forgive sin and save in time of trouble .     Woe to timid heart and droop hand ,    to the sinner who walk a double path !   Woe to the faint of heart ! for they do not trust ,   and therefore have no shelter !   Woe to you that have lose hope !   what will you do at the Lords visitation ?     those who fear the Lord do not disobey his word ;   those who love he keep his way .    those who fear the Lord seek to please he ;   those who love he be fill with his law .   those who fear the Lord prepare their heart   and humble themselves before he .     let we fall into the hand of the Lord   and not into the hand of mortal , for equal to his majesty be his mercy ;   and equal to his name be his work .
