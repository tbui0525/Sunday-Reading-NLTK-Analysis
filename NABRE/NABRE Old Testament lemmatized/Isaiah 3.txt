b '   judgment on Jerusalem and Judah    the Lord , the   Lord   of host ,   will take away from Jerusalem and from Judah Support and staff\xe2\x80\x94   all support of bread ,   all support of water :    hero and warrior ,   judge and prophet , diviner and elder ,   the captain of fifty and the nobleman ,   counselor , skilled magician , and expert charmer .   I will place boy as their prince ;   the fickle will govern they ,    and the people will oppress one another ,   yes , each one the neighbor . the child will be insolent toward the elder ,   and the base toward the honorable .    when anyone seize a brother   in their father house , say , you have clothe ! be our ruler ,   and take in hand this ruin!\xe2\x80\x94    he will cry out in that day : I can not be a healer ,    when there be neither bread nor clothing in my own house !   you will not make I a ruler of the people !   Jerusalem have stumble , Judah have fall ;   for their speech and deed affront the   Lord ,   a provocation in the sight of his majesty .   their very look bear witness against they ;    they boast of their sin like Sodom ,   they do not hide it .   Woe to they !   they deal out evil to themselves .   happy the just , for it will go well with they ,   the fruit of their work they will eat .   Woe to the wicked ! it will go ill with they ,   with the work of their hand they will be repay .   my people\xe2\x80\x94infants oppress they ,   woman rule over they ! my people , your leader deceive you ,    they confuse the path you should follow .      the   Lord   rise to accuse ,   stand to try his people .   the Lord enter into judgment   with the people elder and prince : you , you who have devour the vineyard ;   the loot wrest from the poor be in your house .   what do you mean by crush my people ,   and grind down the face of the poor ?   say the Lord , the   God   of host .    the Haughty Women of Zion    the   Lord   say :    because the daughter of Zion be haughty ,   and walk with neck outstretche , Ogling and mince as they go ,   their anklet tinkle with every step ,   the Lord shall cover the scalp of zion daughter with scab ,   and the   Lord   shall lay bare their head .        on that day the   Lord   will do away with the finery of the anklet , sunburst , and crescent ;      the pendant , bracelet , and veil ;      the headdress , bangle , cincture , perfume box , and amulet ;      the signet ring , and the nose ring ;      the court dress , wrap , cloaks , and purse ;      the lace gown , linen tunic , turban , and shawl .     instead of perfume there will be stench ,   instead of a girdle , a rope , and instead of elaborate coiffure , baldness ;   instead of a rich gown , a sackcloth skirt . then , instead of beauty , shame .   your man will fall by the sword ,   and your champion ,    in war ;    her gate will lament and mourn ,   as the city sit desolate on the ground .
