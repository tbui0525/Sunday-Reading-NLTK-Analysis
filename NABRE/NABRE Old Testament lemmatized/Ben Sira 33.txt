b '    no evil can harm the one who fear the   Lord ;   through trial , again and again he be rescue .    whoever hate the law be without wisdom ,   and be toss about like a boat in a storm .   the prudent trust in the word of the   Lord ,   and the law be dependable for they as a divine oracle .    prepare your word and then you will be listen to ;   draw upon your training , and give your answer .     like the wheel of a cart be the mind of a fool ,   and his thought like a turn axle .   a mock friend be like a stallion   that neigh , no matter who the rider may be .      why be one day more important than another ,   when the same sun light up every day of the year ?   by the   Lord s knowledge they be keep distinct ;   and he designate the season and feast .    some he exalt and sanctifie ,   and other he list as ordinary day .    likewise , all people be of clay ,   and from earth humankind be form ;    in the fullness of his knowledge the Lord distinguish they ,   and he designate their different way .   some he bless and exalted ,   and some he sanctify and draw to himself . other he curse and bring low ,   and expel they from their place .   like clay in the hand of a potter ,   to be mold accord to his pleasure , so be people in the hand of their maker ,   to be deal with as he decide .    as evil contrast with good , and death with life ,   so be sinner in contrast with the godly .    see now all the work of the most high :   they come in pair , one the opposite of the other .     now I be the last to keep vigil ,    like a glean follow the grape - picker ;   since by the Lords blessing I have make progress   till like a grape - picker I have fill my wine press ,   consider that not for myself only have I labor ,   but for all who seek instruction .    Property and servant    listen to I , leader of the people ;   ruler of the congregation , pay heed !   20a let neither son nor wife , neither brother nor friend ,   have power over you as long as you live .   while breath of life be still in you ,   let no one take your place . 20b do not give your wealth to another ,   lest you must plead for support yourself .   far well that your child plead with you   than that you should look for a handout from they .   keep control over all your affair ;   bring no stain on your honor .   when your few day reach their limit ,   at the time of death distribute your inheritance .     Fodder and whip and load for a donkey ;   food , correction and work for a slave .   make a slave work , and he will look for rest ;   let his hand be idle and he will seek to be free .    the yoke and harness will bow the neck ;   and for a wicked slave , punishment in the stock .   Force he to work that he be not idle ,    for idleness teach much mischief .   Put he to work , as be fitting for he ;   and if he do not obey , load he with chain . but never lord it over any human being ,   and do nothing unjust .   if you have but one slave , treat he like yourself ,   for you have acquire he with your life blood ; if you have but one slave , deal with he as a brother ,   for you need he as you need your life .    if you mistreat he and he run away ,    in what direction will you look for he ?
