b ' the blessed Home of the just   a song of ascent . I bless be all who fear the   Lord ,   and who walk in his way .    what your hand provide you will enjoy ;   you will be bless and prosper :    your wife will be like a fruitful vine   within your home , your child like young olive plant   around your table .    just so will the man be bless   who fear the   Lord .    II   may the   Lord   bless you from Zion ;   may you see Jerusalems prosperity   all the day of your life ,     and live to see your children child .   Peace upon Israel !              '
