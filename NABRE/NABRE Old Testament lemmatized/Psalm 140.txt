b ' prayer for Deliverance from the Wicked   for the leader . a psalm of David .    I   deliver I ,   Lord , from the wicked ;   preserve I from the violent ,    from those who plan evil in their heart ,   who stir up conflict every day ,    who sharpen their tongue like a serpent ,   venom of asp upon their lip .   Selah    II   keep I ,   Lord , from the clutch of the wicked ;   preserve I from the violent ,   who plot to trip I up .     the arrogant have set a trap for I ;   they have spread out rope for a net ,   lay snare for I by the wayside . Selah   I say to the   Lord : you be my God ;    listen ,   Lord , to the word of my plea .   Lord , my master , my strong deliverer ,   you cover my head on the day of armed conflict .   Lord , do not grant the desire of the wicked one ;   do not let his plot succeed . Selah    III   those who surround I raise their head ;   may the mischief they threaten overwhelm they .   drop burn coal upon they ;    cast they into the watery pit never more to rise .     slanderer will not survive on earth ;   evil will hunt down the man of violence to overthrow he .   for I know the   Lord   will take up the cause of the needy ,   justice for the poor .   then the righteous will give thank to your name ;   the upright will dwell in your presence .
