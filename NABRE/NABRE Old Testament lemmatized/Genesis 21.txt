Abraham be a hundred year old when his son Isaac be bear to he .      Sarah then say , God have give I cause to laugh ,    and all who hear of it will laugh with I .        who would ever have tell Abraham , she add , that Sarah would nurse child ! yet I have bear he a son in his old age .      the child grow and be wean , and Abraham hold a great banquet on the day of the child wean .     Sarah notice the son whom Hagar the Egyptian have bear to Abraham play with her son Isaac ;      so she demand of Abraham : drive out that slave and her son ! no son of that slave be go to share the inheritance with my son Isaac !        Abraham be greatly distressed because it concern a son of his .        but God say to Abraham : do not be distressed about the boy or about your slave woman . Obey Sarah , no matter what she ask of you ; for it be through Isaac that descendant will bear your name .        as for the son of the slave woman , I will make a nation of he also ,    since he too be your offspring .     early the next morning Abraham get some bread and a skin of water and give they to Hagar . then , place the child on her back ,    he send she away . as she roam aimlessly in the wilderness of beer - sheba ,      the water in the skin be use up . so she put the child down under one of the bush ,      and then go and sit down opposite he , about a bowshot away ; for she say to herself , I can not watch the child die . as she sit opposite he , she weep aloud .      God hear the boy voice , and Gods angel call to Hagar from heaven : what be the matter , Hagar ? do not fear ; God have hear the boy voice in this plight of his .        get up , lift up the boy and hold he by the hand ; for I will make of he a great nation .      then God open her eye , and she see a well of water . she go and fill the skin with water , and then let the boy drink .     God be with the boy as he grow up . he live in the wilderness and become an expert bowman .      he live in the wilderness of Paran . his mother get a wife for he from the land of Egypt .    the Covenant at Beer - sheba .      at that time Abimelech , accompany by Phicol , the commander of his army , say to Abraham : God be with you in everything you do .      so now , swear to I by God at this place    that you will not deal falsely with I or with my progeny and posterity , but will act as loyally toward I and the land in which you reside as I have act toward you .      Abraham reply , I so swear .     Abraham , however , reproach Abimelech about a well that Abimelechs servant have seize by force .      I have no idea who do that , Abimelech reply . in fact , you never tell I about it , nor do I ever hear of it until now .     then Abraham take sheep and cattle and give they to Abimelech and the two make a covenant .      Abraham also set apart seven ewe lamb of the flock ,      and Abimelech ask he , what be the purpose of these seven ewe lamb that you have set apart ?      Abraham answer , the seven ewe lamb you shall accept from I that you may be my witness that I dig this well .      this be why the place be call beer - sheba ; the two of they take an oath there .      when they have thus make the covenant in Beer - sheba , Abimelech , along with Phicol , the commander of his army , leave to return to the land of the Philistines .      Abraham plant a tamarisk at beer - sheba , and there he invoke by name the   Lord , God the Eternal .        Abraham reside in the land of the Philistines for a long time .             '
