Abram fall face down and God say to he :      for my part , here be my covenant with you : you be to become the father of a multitude of nation .        no long will you be call Abram ; your name will be Abraham ,    for I be make you the father of a multitude of nation .        I will make you exceedingly fertile ; I will make nation of you ; king will stem from you .      I will maintain my covenant between I and you and your descendant after you throughout the age as an everlasting covenant , to be your God and the God of your descendant after you .        I will give to you and to your descendant after you the land in which you be now reside as alien , the whole land of Canaan , as a permanent possession ; and I will be their God .        God say to Abraham : for your part , you and your descendant after you must keep my covenant throughout the age .      this be the covenant between I and you and your descendant after you that you must keep : every male among you shall be circumcise .         Circumcise the flesh of your foreskin . that will be the sign of the covenant between I and you .        throughout the age , every male among you , when he be eight day old , shall be circumcise , include houseborn slave and those acquire with money from any foreigner who be not of your descendant .        yes , both the houseborn slave and those acquire with money must be circumcise . thus my covenant will be in your flesh as an everlasting covenant .      if a male be uncircumcised , that is , if the flesh of his foreskin have not be cut away , such a one will be cut off from his people ; he have break my covenant .     God far say to Abraham : as for Sarai your wife , do not call her Sarai ; her name will be Sarah .        I will bless she , and I will give you a son by she . she also will I bless ; she will give rise to nation , and ruler of people will issue from she .        Abraham fall face down and laugh    as he say to himself , can a child be bear to a man who be a hundred year old ? can Sarah give birth at ninety ?        so Abraham say to God , if only Ishmael could live in your favor !      God reply : even so , your wife Sarah be to bear you a son , and you shall call he Isaac . it be with he that I will maintain my covenant as an everlasting covenant and with his descendant after he .        now as for Ishmael , I will heed you : I hereby bless he . I will make he fertile and will multiply he exceedingly . he will become the father of twelve chieftain , and I will make of he a great nation .        but my covenant I will maintain with Isaac , whom Sarah shall bear to you by this time next year .        when he have finish speak with Abraham , God depart from he .     then Abraham take his son Ishmael and all his slave , whether bear in his house or acquire with his money\xe2\x80\x94every male among the member of Abrahams household\xe2\x80\x94and he circumcise the flesh of their foreskin on that same day , as God have tell he to do .      Abraham be ninety - nine year old when the flesh of his foreskin be circumcise ,        and his son Ishmael be thirteen year old when the flesh of his foreskin be circumcise .      thus , on that same day Abraham and his son Ishmael be circumcise ;      and all the male of his household , include the slave bear in his house or acquire with his money from foreigner , be circumcise with he .
