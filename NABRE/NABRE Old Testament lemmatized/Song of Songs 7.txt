b '   the Beauty of the Beloved   d ?   turn , turn , o Shulammite !    turn , turn that we may gaze upon you ! W   how can you gaze upon the Shulammite   as at the dance of the two camp ?   M   how beautiful be your foot in sandal ,    o noble daughter ! your curve thigh like jewel ,   the product of skilled hand .   your valley ,    a round bowl   that should never lack mixed wine . your belly , a mound of wheat ,   encircle with lily .    your breast be like two fawn ,   twin of a gazelle .    your neck like a tower of ivory ;   your eye , pool in Heshbon   by the gate of Bath - rabbim . your nose like the tower of Lebanon   that look toward Damascus .    your head rise upon you like Carmel ;    your hair be like purple ;   a king be catch in its lock .    love desire   how beautiful you be , how fair ,   my love , daughter of delight !   your very form resemble a date - palm ,    and your breast , cluster .   I think , let I climb the date - palm !   let I take hold of its branch ! let your breast be like cluster of the vine   and the fragrance of your breath like apple ,   and your mouth like the good wine\xe2\x80\x94   W that flow down smoothly for my lover ,   glide    over my lip and tooth .    I belong to my lover ,    his yearning be for I .   come , my lover ! let we go out to the field ,   let we pass the night among the henna .    let we go early to the vineyard , and see   if the vine be in bloom , if the bud have open ,   if the pomegranate have blossom ; there will I give you my love .   the mandrake    give forth fragrance ,   and over our door be all choice fruit ; fruit both fresh and dry , my lover ,   have I keep in store for you .
