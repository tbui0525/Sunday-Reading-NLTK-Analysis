b '     but the ephraimite say to he , what have you do to we , not summon we when you go to fight against Midian ? and they quarrel bitterly with he .      but he answer they , what have I do in comparison with you ? be not the gleaning of Ephraim well than the vintage of Abiezer ?        it be into your power God deliver the prince of Midian , Oreb and Zeeb .    what have I be able to do in comparison with you ? when he say this , their anger against he subside .     when Gideon reach the Jordan and cross it , he and his three hundred man be exhausted and famished .      so he say to the people of Succoth , will you give my follower some loaf of bread ? they be exhausted , and I be pursue Zebah and Zalmunna , king of Midian .      but the prince of Succoth reply , be the hand of Zebah and Zalmunna already in your possession , that we should give food to your army ?        Gideon say , very well ; when the   Lord   have deliver Zebah and Zalmunna into my power , I will thrash your body with desert thorn and brier .      he go up from there to Penuel and make the same request of they , but the people of Penuel answer he as have the people of Succoth .      so to the people of Penuel , too , he say , when I return in peace , I will demolish this tower .     now Zebah and Zalmunna be in Karkor with their force of about fifteen thousand man ; these be all who be leave of the whole Kedemite army , a hundred and twenty thousand swordsman having fall .      Gideon go up by the route of the tent - dweller east of Nobah and Jogbehah , and attack the force when it feel secure .      Zebah and Zalmunna flee and Gideon pursue they . he capture the two king of Midian , Zebah and Zalmunna , terrify the entire force .     then Gideon , son of Joash , return from battle by the pass of here .      he capture a young man of Succoth and question he , and he write down for he the seventy - seven prince and elder of Succoth .      so he go to the prince of Succoth and say , here be Zebah and Zalmunna , with whom you taunt I , be the hand of Zebah and Zalmunna already in your possession , that we should give food to your weary man ?      he seize the elder of the city , and with desert thorn and brier he thrash the people of Succoth .      he also demolish the tower of Penuel and kill the people of the city .     then he say to Zebah and Zalmunna , what about the man you kill at Tabor ? they be all like you , they reply . they appear to be prince .      they be my brother , my mother son , he say . as the   Lord   live , if you have spare their life , I would not kill you .      then he say to his firstborn , Jether , go , kill they . but the boy do not draw his sword , for he be afraid , for he be still a boy .       Zebah and Zalmunna say , come , kill we yourself , for as a man be , so be his strength . so Gideon step forward and kill Zebah and Zalmunna . he also take the crescent that be on the neck of their camel .      the Israelites then say to Gideon , Rule over us\xe2\x80\x94you , your son , and your son son\xe2\x80\x94for you save we from the power of Midian .      but Gideon answer they , I will not rule over you , nor shall my son rule over you . the   Lord   must rule over you .      Gideon go on to say , let I make a request of you . give I , each of you , a ring from his spoil . ( since they be Ishmaelites ,    the enemy have gold ring . )      we will certainly give they , they reply , and they spread out a cloak into which everyone throw a ring from his spoil .      the gold ring he have request weigh seventeen hundred gold shekel , apart from the crescent and pendant , the purple garment wear by the king of Midian , and apart from the trapping that be on the neck of their camel .       Gideon make an ephod out of the gold and place it in his city , Ophrah . all Israel prostitute themselves there , and it become a snare to Gideon and his household .     Midian be bring into subjection by the Israelites ; they no long hold their head high , and the land have rest for forty year ,    during the lifetime of Gideon .    Gideons Son Abimelech .     then Jerubbaal , son of Joash , go to live in his house .       now Gideon have seventy son , his own offspring , for he have many wife .      his concubine    who live in Shechem also bear he a son , whom he name Abimelech .      at a good old age Gideon , son of Joash , die and be bury in the tomb of Joash his father in Ophrah of the Abiezrites .       but after Gideon be dead , the Israelites again prostitute themselves by follow the baal , make Baal - berith    their god .      the Israelites do not remember the   Lord , their God , who have deliver they from the power of their enemy all around they .      nor be they loyal to the house of Jerubbaal ( Gideon ) for all the good he have do for Israel .
