b '    a good name be more desirable than great rich ,   and high esteem , than gold and silver .     Rich and poor have a common bond :   the   Lord   be the maker of they all .    the astute see an evil and hide ,   while the naive continue on and pay the penalty .     the result of humility and fear of the   Lord   be rich , honor and life .    thorn and snare be on the path of the crooked ;   those who would safeguard their life will avoid they .   train the young in the way they should go ;   even when old , they will not swerve from it .    the rich rule over the poor ,   and the borrower be the slave of the lender .    those who sow iniquity reap calamity ,    and the rod use in anger will fail .    the generous will be bless ,   for they share their food with the poor .   expel the arrogant and discord go too ;   strife and insult cease .   the   Lord   love the pure of heart ;    the person of win speech have a king for a friend .   the eye of the   Lord   watch over the knowledgeable ,   but he defeat the project of the faithless .   the sluggard say , a lion be outside ;    I might be slay in the street .    the mouth of the foreign woman be a deep pit ;    whoever incur the   Lord s anger will fall into it .   Folly be bind to the heart of a youth ,   but the rod of discipline will drive it out .    oppress the poor for enrichment ,   give to the rich : both be sheer loss .       the word of the Wise :   incline your ear , and hear my word ,    and let your mind attend to my teaching ;   for it will be well if you hold they within you ,   if they all be ready on your lip .   that your trust may be in the   Lord ,   I make they known to you today\xe2\x80\x94yes , to you .   have I not write for you thirty saying ,   contain counsel and knowledge ,   to teach you truly   how to give a dependable report to one who send you ?   do not rob the poor because they be poor ,   nor crush the needy at the gate ;    for the   Lord   will defend their cause ,    and will plunder those who plunder they .   do not be friendly with hothead ,   nor associate with the wrathful ,   lest you learn their way ,   and become ensnare .   do not be one of those who give their hand in pledge ,   those who become surety for debt ;    for if you be unable to pay ,   your bed will be take from under you .    do not remove the ancient landmark    that your ancestor set up .    do you see those skilled at their work ?   they will stand in the presence of king ,   but not in the presence of the obscure .
