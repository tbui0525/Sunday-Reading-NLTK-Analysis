b '     as King Antiochus pass through the eastern province , he hear that in Persia there be a city , Elam ,    famous for its wealth in silver and gold ,      and that its temple be very rich , contain gold helmet , breastplate , and weapon leave there by the first king of the Greeks , Alexander , son of Philip , king of Macedon .      he go therefore and try to capture and loot the city . but he could not do so , because his plan become know to the people of the city      who rise up in battle against he . so he flee and in great dismay withdraw from there to return to Babylon .     while he be in Persia , a messenger bring he news that the army that have go into the land of Judah have be route ;      that Lysias have go at first with a strong army and be drive back ; that the people of Judah have grow strong by reason of the arm , wealth , and abundant spoil take from the army they have cut down ;      that they have pull down the abomination which he have build upon the altar in Jerusalem ; and that they have surround with high wall both the sanctuary , as it have be before , and his city of Beth - zur .      when the king hear this news , he be astonished and very much shaken . sick with grief because his design have fail , he take to his bed .      there he remain many day , assail by wave of grief , for he think he be go to die .      so he call in all his Friends and say to they : sleep have depart from my eye , and my heart sink from anxiety .      I say to myself : into what tribulation have I come , and in what flood of sorrow be I now ! yet I be kindly and beloved in my rule .      but I now recall the evil I do in Jerusalem , when I carry away all the vessel of silver and gold that be in it , and for no cause give order that the inhabitant of Judah be destroy .      I know that this be why these evil have overtake I ; and now I be die , in bitter grief , in a foreign land .     then he summon Philip , one of his Friends , and put he in charge of his whole kingdom .      he give he his diadem , his robe , and his signet ring , so that he might guide the king son Antiochus and bring he up to be king .      so King Antiochus die there in the one hundred and forty - ninth year .        when Lysias learn that the king be dead , he set up the king son Antiochus ,    whom he have rear as a child , to be king in his place ; and he give he the title Eupator .     Siege of the Citadel .     those in the citadel be hem Israel in around the sanctuary , continually try to harm they and to strengthen the Gentiles .        and so Judas plan to destroy they , and assemble the people to besiege they .      so in the one hundred and fiftieth year    they assemble and besiege the citadel , for which purpose he construct platform and siege engine .      but some of the besiege escape , and some renegade Israelites join they .      they go to the king and say : how long will you fail to do justice and to avenge our kindred ?      we agree to serve your father and to follow his order and obey his edict .      and for this our own people have become our enemy ; they have put to death as many of we as they could find and have seize our inheritance .      they have act aggressively not only against we , but throughout their whole territory .      look ! today they have besiege the citadel in Jerusalem in order to capture it , and they have fortify the sanctuary and Beth - zur .      unless you act quickly to prevent they , they will do even bad thing than these , and you will not be able to stop they .      when the king hear this he be enrage , and he call together all his Friends , the officer of his army , and the commander of the cavalry .      mercenary force also come to he from other kingdom and from the island of the sea .      his army number a hundred thousand footsoldier , twenty thousand cavalry , and thirty - two elephant train for war .      they pass through Idumea and camp before Beth - zur . for many day they attack it ; they construct siege engine , but the besiege make a sortie and burn these , and they fight bravely .    Battle of Beth - zechariah .     then Judas march away from the citadel and move his camp to Beth - zechariah ,    opposite the king camp .      the king , rise before dawn , move his force hastily along the road to Beth - zechariah ; and the troop prepare for battle and sound the trumpet .      they make the elephant drunk on the juice of grape and mulberry to get they ready to fight .      the beast be distribute along the phalanx , each elephant having assign to it a thousand man in coat of mail , with bronze helmet on their head , and five hundred pick cavalry .      these accompany the beast wherever it be ; wherever it move , they move too and never leave it .      each elephant be outfit with a strong wooden tower , fasten to it by a harness ; each tower hold three soldier who fight from it , besides the indian driver .      the remain cavalry be station on one or the other of the two flank of the army , to harass the enemy and to be protect by the phalanx .      when the sun shine on the gold and bronze shield , the mountain gleam with their brightness and blaze like flame torch .      part of the king army spread out along the height , while some be on low ground , and they march forward steadily in good order .      all who hear the noise of their number , the tramp of their marching , and the clanging of the arm , tremble ; for the army be very great and strong .     Judas with his army advance to fight , and six hundred man of the king army fall .      Eleazar , call Avaran , see one of the beast cover with royal armor and big than any of the other , and so he think the king be on it .        he give up his life to save his people and win an everlasting name for himself .      he dash courageously up to it in the middle of the phalanx , kill man right and leave , so that they part before he .      he run under the elephant , stab it and kill it . the beast fall to the ground on top of he , and he die there .      but when Judas troop see the strength of the royal army and the ardor of its force , they retreat from they .    the Siege of Jerusalem .     some of the king army go up to Jerusalem to attack they , and the king establish camp in Judea and at Mount Zion .      he make peace with the people of Beth - zur , and they evacuate the city , because they have no food there to enable they to withstand a siege , for that be a sabbath year in the land .         the king take Beth - zur and station a garrison there to hold it .      for many day he besiege the sanctuary , set up platform and siege engine , fire - thrower , catapult and mechanical bow for shoot arrow and projectile .      the defender counter by set up siege engine of their own , and keep up the fight a long time .      but there be no provision in the storeroom , because it be the seventh year , and the reserve have be eat up by those who have be rescue from the Gentiles and bring to Judea .      few man remain in the sanctuary because the famine be too much for they ; the rest scatter , each to his own home .    Peace Treaty .      Lysias hear that Philip , whom King Antiochus , before his death , have appoint to train his son Antiochus to be king ,      have return from Persia and Media with the army that accompany the king , and that he be seek to take over the government .      so he hastily decide to withdraw . he say to the king , the leader of the army , and the soldier : we be grow weak every day , our provision be scanty , the place we be besiege be strong , and it be our duty to take care of the affair of the kingdom .        therefore let we now come to term with these people and make peace with they and all their nation .      let we grant they freedom to live accord to their own law as formerly ; it be on account of their law , which we abolish , that they become enraged and do all these thing .     the proposal please the king and the leader ; he send peace term to the Jews , and they accept .      so the king and the leader swear an oath to they , and on these term the Jews evacuate the fortification .      but when the king enter Mount Zion and see how the place be fortify , he break the oath he have swear and give order to tear down the encircle wall .      then he depart in haste and return to Antioch , where he find Philip in control of the city . he fight against he and take the city by force .
