b '    Second Speech of Eliphaz .      then Eliphaz the Temanite answer and say :     do a wise man answer with windy opinion ,   or puff himself up with the east wind ?   do he argue in speech that do not avail ,   and in word that be to no profit ?   you in fact do away with piety ,   you lessen devotion toward God ,   because your wickedness instruct your mouth ,   and you choose to speak like the crafty .   your own mouth condemn you , not I ;    your own lip refute you .   be you the first to be bear ?   be you bring forth before the hill ?   do you listen in on Gods council    and restrict wisdom to yourself ?   what do you know that we do not know ,    or understand that we do not ?   there be gray - haired old man among we ,   more advanced in year than your father .   be the consolation of God not enough for you ,   and speech that deal gently with you ?   why do your heart carry you away ,   and why do your eye flash ,   so that you turn your anger against God   and let such word escape your mouth !   how can any mortal be blameless ,    anyone bear of woman be righteous ?    if in his holy one God place no confidence ,    and if the heaven be not without blame in his sight ,   how much less so be the abominable and corrupt :   people who drink in iniquity like water !   I will show you , if you listen to I ;   what I have see I will tell\xe2\x80\x94   what the wise relate   and have not contradict since the day of their ancestor ,   to whom alone the land be give ,   when no foreigner move among they :   the wicked be in torment all his day ,   and limited year be in store for the ruthless ;   the sound of terror be in his ear ;   when all be prosperous , a spoiler come upon he .   he despair of escape the darkness ,   and look ever for the sword ;   a wanderer , food for vulture ,   he know destruction be imminent .   a day of darkness fill he with dread ;   distress and anguish overpower he ,   like a king expect an attack .   because he have stretch out his hand against God   and arrogantly challenge the Almighty ,   rush defiantly against he ,   with the stout boss of his shield .   although he have cover his face with his crassness ,   pad his loin with blubber ,   he shall dwell in ruined city ,   in house that be desert ,   crumble into rubble .   he shall not be rich , his possession shall not endure ;   his property shall not spread over the land .   a flame shall sear his early growth ,   and with the wind his blossom shall disappear .   let he not trust in his height , mislead ,   even though his height be like the palm tree .    he shall wither before his time ,   his branch no long green .   he shall be like a vine that shed its grape unripene ,   like an olive tree cast off its blossom .   for the breed of the impious shall be sterile ,    and fire shall consume the tent of extortioner .   they conceive malice , bring forth deceit ,    give birth to fraud .
