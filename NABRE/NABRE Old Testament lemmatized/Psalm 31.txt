b ' prayer in Distress and Thanksgiving for escape   for the leader . a psalm of David .    I   in you ,   Lord , I take refuge ;    let I never be put to shame . in your righteousness deliver I ;    incline your ear to I ;   make haste to rescue I ! be my rock of refuge ,   a stronghold to save I .   for you be my rock and my fortress ;    for your name sake lead I and guide I .   free I from the net they have set for I ,   for you be my refuge .    into your hand I commend my spirit ;    you will redeem I ,   Lord , God of truth .   you hate those who serve worthless idol ,   but I trust in the   Lord .   I will rejoice and be glad in your mercy ,   once you have see my misery ,   [ and ] get to know the distress of my soul .    you will not abandon I into enemy hand ,   but will set my foot in a free and open space .    II   be gracious to I ,   Lord , for I be in distress ;   affliction be wear down my eye ,   my throat and my inside .   my life be wear out by sorrow ,   and my year by sigh . my strength fail in my affliction ;   my bone be wear down .    to all my foe I be a thing of scorn ,   and especially to my neighbor   a horror to my friend . when they see I in public ,   they quickly shy away .    I be forget , out of mind like the dead ;   I be like a wear - out tool .    I hear the whisper of the crowd ;   terror be all around I .   they conspire together against I ;   they plot to take my life .   but I trust in you ,   Lord ;   I say , you be my God .    my destiny be in your hand ;   rescue I from my enemy ,   from the hand of my pursuer .   let your face shine on your servant ;    save I in your mercy .   do not let I be put to shame ,   for I have call to you ,   Lord . put the wicked to shame ;   reduce they to silence in Sheol .   strike dumb their lie lip ,   which speak arrogantly against the righteous   in contempt and scorn .     III   how great be your goodness , Lord ,   store up for those who fear you . you display it for those who trust you ,   in the sight of the child of Adam .   you hide they in the shelter of your presence ,   safe from scheme enemy . you conceal they in your tent ,   away from the strife of tongue .    bless be the   Lord ,   marvelously he show to I   his mercy in a fortified city .   though I have say in my alarm ,   I be cut off from your eye .   yet you hear my voice , my cry for mercy ,   when I plead with you for help .   love the   Lord , all you who be faithful to he .   the   Lord   protect the loyal ,   but repay the arrogant in full .   be strong and take heart ,   all who hope in the   Lord .
