Final Preparations for the Journey .     I assemble they by the river that flow toward Ahava ,    where we camp for three day . there I perceive that both layman and priest be present , but I could not discover a single Levite .      so I send for discern leader , Eliezer , Ariel , Shemaiah , Jarib , Elnathan , Nathan , Zechariah , and Meshullam ,      with a command for Iddo , the leader in the place Casiphia , instruct they what to say to Iddo and his kinsman , and to the temple servant in Casiphia , in order to procure for us minister for the house of our God .       since the favor hand of our God be over we , they send to we a well - instruct man , one of the descendant of Mahli , son of Levi , son of Israel , namely Sherebiah , with his son and kinsman , eighteen man .      they also send we Hashabiah , and with he Jeshaiah , descendant of Merari , and their kinsman and their son , twenty man .       of the temple servant , those whom David and the prince appoint to serve the Levites , there be two hundred and twenty . all these be enrol by name .     then I proclaim a fast , there by the river of Ahava , that we might humble ourselves before our God to seek from he a safe journey for ourselves , our child , and all our possession .       for I be ashamed to ask the king for troop and horseman to protect we against enemy along the way , since we have say to the king , the favor hand of our God be over all who seek he , but his fierce anger be against all who forsake he .      so we fast , seek this from our God , and it be grant .      next I select twelve of the priestly leader along with Sherebiah , Hashabiah , and ten of their kinsman ,      and I weigh out before they the silver and the gold and the vessel offer for the house of our God by the king , his counselor , his official , and all the Israelites of that region .      I weigh out into their hand these amount : silver , six hundred and fifty talent ; silver vessel , one hundred ; gold , one hundred talent ;      twenty golden bowl value at a thousand daric ; two vase of excellent polished bronze , as precious as gold .      I address they in these word : you be consecrate to the   Lord , and the vessel be also consecrate ; the silver and the gold be a voluntary offering to the   Lord , the God of your ancestor .      watch over they carefully until you weigh they out in Jerusalem in the presence of the chief priest and levite and the leader of ancestral house of Israel , in the chamber of the house of the   Lord .      the priest and the Levites then take over the silver , the gold , and the vessel that have be weigh out , to bring they to Jerusalem , to the house of our God .    Arrival in Jerusalem .     we set out from the river of Ahava on the twelfth day of the first month to go to Jerusalem . the hand of our God remain over we , and he protect we from enemy and robber along the way .      we arrive in Jerusalem , where we rest for three day .      on the fourth day , the silver , the gold , and the vessel be weigh out in the house of our God and give to the priest Meremoth , son of Uriah , with whom be Eleazar , son of Phinehas ; they be assist by the Levites Jozabad , son of Jeshua , and Noadiah , son of Binnui .      everything be in order as to number and weight , and the total weight be register . at that same time ,      those who have return from the captivity , the exile , offer as burn offering to the God of Israel twelve bull for all Israel , ninety - six ram , seventy - seven lamb , and twelve goat as sin offering : all these as a burn offering to the   Lord .       finally , the order of the king be present to the king satrap and to the governor in West - of - Euphrates , who give their support to the people and to the house of God .
