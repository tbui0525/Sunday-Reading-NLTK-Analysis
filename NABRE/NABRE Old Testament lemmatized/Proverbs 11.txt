b '    false scale be an abomination to the   Lord ,   but an honest weight , his delight .     when pride come , disgrace come ;   but with the humble be wisdom .    the honesty of the upright guide they ;   the faithles be ruin by their duplicity .   Wealth be useless on a day of wrath ,     but justice save from death .   the justice of the honest make their way straight ,   but by their wickedness the wicked fall .     the justice of the upright save they ,   but the faithles be catch in their own intrigue .   when a person die , hope be destroy ;    expectation pin on wealth be destroy .    the just be rescue from a tight spot ,   but the wicked fall into it instead .   by a word the impious ruin their neighbor ,    but through their knowledge the just be rescue .    when the just prosper , the city rejoice ;    when the wicked perish , there be jubilation .   through the blessing of the upright the city be exalt ,   but through the mouth of the wicked it be overthrow .   whoever revile a neighbor lack sense ,   but the intelligent keep silent .   one who slander reveal secret ,    but a trustworthy person keep a confidence .   for lack of guidance a people fall ;   security lie in many counselor .    harm will come to anyone go surety for another ,    but whoever hate give pledge be secure .    a gracious woman gain esteem ,   and ruthless man gain wealth .    kindly people benefit themselves ,   but the merciless harm themselves .   the wicked make empty profit ,   but those who sow justice have a sure reward .    Justice lead toward life ,   but pursuit of evil , toward death .   the crooked in heart be an abomination to the   Lord ,   but those who walk blamelessly be his delight .    be assure , the wicked shall not go unpunished ,   but the offspring of the just shall escape .   like a golden ring in a swine snout   be a beautiful woman without judgment .    the desire of the just end only in good ;   the expectation of the wicked be wrath .   one person be lavish yet grow still rich ;   another be too sparing , yet be the poor .    whoever confer benefit will be amply enrich ,   and whoever refresh other will be refresh .   whoever hoard grain , the people curse ,   but blessing be on the head of one who distribute it !   those who seek the good seek favor ,   but those who pursue evil will have evil come upon they .    those who trust in their rich will fall ,   but like green leave the just will flourish .    those who trouble their household inherit the wind ,   and fool become slave to the wise of heart .   the fruit of justice be a tree of life ,   and one who take life be a sage .    if the just be recompense on the earth ,   how much more the wicked and the sinner !
