b '    and Hannah pray :   my heart exult in the   Lord ,   my horn be exalt by my God . I have swallow up my enemy ;   I rejoice in your victory .    there be no Holy One like the   Lord ;   there be no Rock like our God .    speak boastfully no long ,   do not let arrogance issue from your mouth .   for an all - know God be the   Lord ,   a God who weigh action .      the bow of the mighty be break ,   while the totter gird on strength .    the well - fed hire themselves out for bread ,   while the hungry no long have to toil . the barren wife bear seven son ,   while the mother of many languishe .      the   Lord   put to death and give life ,   cast down to Sheol and bring up again .    the   Lord   make poor and make rich ,   humble , and also exalt .   he raise the needy from the dust ;   from the ash heap lift up the poor , to seat they with noble   and make a glorious throne their heritage .    for the pillar of the earth be the   Lord s ,   and he have set the world upon they .    he guard the footstep of his faithful one ,   but the wicked shall perish in the darkness ;   for not by strength do one prevail .   the   Lord s foe shall be shatter ;   the most high in heaven thunder ;   the   Lord   judge the end of the earth . may he give strength to his king ,   and exalt the horn of his anoint !      when Elkanah return home to Ramah , the child remain in the service of the   Lord   under the priest Eli .    Wickedness of Elis Sons .     now the son of Eli be wicked ; they have respect neither for the   Lord       nor for the priest duty toward the people . when someone offer a sacrifice , the priest servant would come with a three - pronged fork , while the meat be still boil ,        and would thrust it into the basin , kettle , caldron , or pot . whatever the fork bring up , the priest would take for himself . they treat all the Israelites who come to the sanctuary at Shiloh in this way .      in fact , even before the fat be burn , the priest servant would come and say to the one offer the sacrifice , give I some meat to roast for the priest . he will not accept boil meat from you , only raw meat .      and if this one protest , let the fat be burn first , then take whatever you wish , he would reply , no , give it to I now , or else I will take it by force .        thus the young man sin grievously in the presence of the   Lord , treat the offering to the   Lord   with disdain .    the Lord Rewards Hannah .     meanwhile the boy Samuel , wear a linen ephod ,    be serve in the presence of the   Lord .      his mother use to make a little garment for he , which she would bring he each time she go up with her husband to offer the customary sacrifice .      and Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife , as they be leave for home . he would say , may the   Lord   repay you with child from this woman for the gift she have make to the   Lord !      the   Lord   favor Hannah so that she conceive and give birth to three more son and two daughter , while young Samuel grow up in the service of the   Lord .     Elis Futile Rebuke .     when Eli be very old , he keep hear how his son be treat all Israel , and that they be behave promiscuously    with the woman serve at the entry of the meeting tent .      so he say to they : why be you do such thing ? I hear from everyone that your behavior be deprave .      stop this , my son ! the report that I hear the   Lord s people spread be not good .      if someone sin against another , anyone can intercede for the sinner with the   Lord ; but if anyone sin against the   Lord , who can intercede    for the sinner ? but they disregard their father warn , since the   Lord   want they dead .      meanwhile , young Samuel be grow in stature and in worth in the estimation of the   Lord   and the people .   the Fate of Elis House .        a man of God come to Eli and say to he : thus say the   Lord : I go so far as to reveal myself to your father house when they be in Egypt as slave to the house of Pharaoh .      I choose they out of all the tribe of Israel to be my priest , to go up to my altar , to burn incense , and to wear the ephod    in my presence ; and I assign all the fire offering of the Israelites to your father house .        why do you stare greedily at my sacrifice and at the offering that I have prescribe ? why do you honor your son more than you honor I , fatten yourself with the choice part of every offering of my people Israel ?       this , therefore , be the oracle of the   Lord , the God of Israel : I say in the past that your family and your father house should minister in my presence forever . but now\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord : far be it from I ! I will honor those who honor I , but those who despise I shall be curse .      yes , the day be come when I will break your strength and the strength of your father house , so that no one in your family live to old age .      you shall witness , like a disappointed rival , all the benefit enjoy by Israel , but no member of your household shall ever grow old .      I will leave you one man at my altar to wear out his eye and waste his strength , but the rest of your family shall die by the sword .      this be a sign for you\xe2\x80\x94what happen to your two son , Hophni and Phinehas . both of they will die on the same day .        I will choose a faithful priest who shall do what I have in heart and mind . I will establish a last house for he and he shall serve in the presence of my anoint forever .      then whoever be leave of your family will grovel before he for a piece of silver or a loaf of bread , say : please assign I a priestly function , that I may have a crust of bread to eat .
