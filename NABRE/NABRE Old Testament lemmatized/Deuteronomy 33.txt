b '   Blessing upon the Tribes .      this be the blessing with which Moses , the man of God , bless the Israelites before he die .       he say : the   Lord   come from Sinai   and dawn on his people from Seir ;   he shine forth from Mount Paran . with he be myriad of holy one ;   at his right hand advance the god .    indeed , lover of the people ,   all the holy one be at your side ; they follow at your heel ,   carry out your decision .   Moses charge we with the law ,   as a possession for the assembly of Jacob .    a king arise    in Jeshurun   when the chief of the people assemble ,   and the tribe of Israel unite .      may Reuben live and not die out ,    but let his number be few .     of Judah he say this : hear ,   Lord , the voice of Judah ,   and bring he to his people .   his own hand defend his cause ;   be a help against his foe .      of Levi he say :   give to Levi your Thummim ,   your Urim    to your faithful one ; he you test at Massah ,   contend against he at the water of Meribah .     he say of his father and mother ,   I have no regard for they ; his brother he would not acknowledge ,   and his own child he do not recognize . for they keep your word ,   and your covenant they uphold .     they teach your ordinance to Jacob ,   your law to Israel . they bring incense to your nostril ,   and burn offering to your altar .   Bless ,   Lord , his strength ,   be pleased with the work of his hand . crush the loin of his adversary   and of his foe , that they may not rise .     of Benjamin he say : the beloved of the   Lord ,   he abide in safety beside he ; he shelter he all day long ;   the beloved abide at his breast .       of Joseph he say :   bless by the   Lord   be his land   with the good of heaven above   and of the abyss crouch beneath ;   with the good of the produce of the sun ,   and the choice yield of the month ;   with the fine gift of the ancient mountain   and the good from the everlasting hill ;   with the good of the earth and its fullness ,   and the favor of the one who dwell on Sinai . let these come upon the head of Joseph   and upon the brow of the prince among his brother .    his firstborn bull , majesty be his !   his horn be the horn of a wild ox ; with they he gore the people ,   attack the end of the earth . these be the myriad of Ephraim ,   and these the thousand of Manasseh .     of Zebulun he say :   Rejoice , Zebulun , in your expedition ,   exult , Issachar , in your tent !   they invite people to the mountain   where they offer right sacrifice , because they suck up the abundance of the sea    and the hidden treasure of the sand .     of Gad he say :   bless be the one who have make Gad so vast !   he lie there like a lion ;   he tear the arm , the head as well .   he see that the good should be his ,   for there the commander portion be assign ;   he come at the head of the people . he carry out the justice of the   Lord   and his ordinance for Israel .      of Dan he say : Dan be a lion cub ,    that spring away from a viper !     of Naphtali he say : Naphtali , abound with favor ,   fill with the blessing of the   Lord ,   take possession of the west and south .      of Asher he say :   most blessed    of son be Asher !   may he be the favorite among his brother ,   and may he dip his foot in oil !   may the bolt of your gate be iron and bronze ;   may your strength endure through all your day !     there be none like the God of Jeshurun ,   who ride the heaven in his power ,   who ride the cloud in his majesty ;    the God of old be a refuge ;   a support be the arm of the Everlasting . he drive the enemy out of your way   and he say , Destroy !    Israel abide securely ,   Jacob dwell apart , in a land of grain and wine ,   where the heavens drip with dew .    happy be you , Israel ! who be like you ,   a people deliver by the   Lord , your help and shield ,   and the sword of your glory . your enemy cringe before you ;   you stride upon their back .
