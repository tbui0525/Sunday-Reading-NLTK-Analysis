b '   Bildads Second Speech .     then Bildad the Shuhite answer and say :     when will you put an end to word ?   reflect , and then we can have discussion .   why be we account like beast ,   equal to they in your sight ?   you who tear yourself in your anger\xe2\x80\x94   shall the earth be neglect on your account   or the rock be move out of its place ?   truly , the light of the wicked be extinguish ;   the flame of his fire cast no light .   in his tent light be darkness ;   the lamp above he go out .    his vigorous step be hem in ,   his own counsel cast he down .   a net catch he by the foot ,   he wander into a pitfall .   a trap seize he by the heel ,   a snare lay hold of he .   a noose be hide for he on the ground ,   a netting for he on the path .   on every side terror frighten he ;    they harry he at each step .   his strength be famish ,   disaster be ready at his side ,   his skin be eat to the limb ,   the firstborn of Death    eat his limb .   he be pluck from the security of his tent ;   and march off to the king of terror .    fire lodge in his tent ,   over his abode brimstone be scatter .   below , his root dry up ,   and above , his branch wither .   his memory perishe from the earth ,    and he have no name in the countryside .   he be drive from light into darkness ,   and banish from the world .   he have neither offshoot nor offspring among his people ,   no survivor where once he dwelt .   those who come after shall be appal at his fate ;   those who go before be seize with horror .   so be it then with the dwelling of the impious ;   such be the place of the one who do not know God !
