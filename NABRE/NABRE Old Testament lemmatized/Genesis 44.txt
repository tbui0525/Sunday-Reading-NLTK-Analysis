b '   Final Test .      then Joseph command his steward : fill the men bag with as much food as they can carry , and put each mans money in the mouth of his bag .      in the mouth of the young one bag put also my silver goblet , together with the money for his grain . the steward do as Joseph say .      at daybreak the man and their donkey be send off .      they have not go far out of the city when Joseph say to his steward : go at once after the man ! when you overtake they , say to they , why do you repay good with evil ? why do you steal my silver goblet ?      be it not the very one from which my master drink and which he use for divination ?    what you have do be wrong .     when the steward overtake they and repeat these word to they ,      they say to he : why do my lord say such thing ? far be it from your servant to do such a thing !      we even bring back to you from the land of Canaan the money that we find in the mouth of our bag . how could we steal silver or gold from your master house ?      if any of your servant be find to have the goblet , he shall die , and as for the rest of we , we shall become my lord slave .      but he reply , now what you propose be fair enough , but only the one who be find to have it shall become my slave , and the rest of you can go free .      then each of they quickly lower his bag to the ground and open it ;      and when a search be make , start with the old and end with the young , the goblet turn up in Benjamins bag .      at this , they tear their garment . then , when each man have load his donkey again , they return to the city .     when Judah and his brother enter Josephs house , he be still there ; so they fling themselves on the ground before he .      how could you do such a thing ? Joseph ask they . do you not know that such a man as I could discern by divination what happen ?      Judah reply : what can we say to my lord ? how can we plead or how try to prove our innocence ? God have uncover your servant guilt .    here we be , then , the slave of my lord\xe2\x80\x94the rest of we no less than the one in whose possession the goblet be find .      Joseph say , far be it from I to act thus ! only the one in whose possession the goblet be find shall become my slave ; the rest of you may go back unharmed to your father .     Judah then step up to he and say : I beg you , my lord , let your servant appeal to my lord , and do not become angry with your servant , for you be the equal of Pharaoh .      my lord ask his servant ,    have you a father , or another brother ?      so we say to my lord , we have an aged father , and a young brother , the child of his old age . this one full brother be dead , and since he be the only one by his mother who be leave , his father be devoted to he .        then you tell your servant , bring he down to I that I might see he .      we reply to my lord , the boy can not leave his father ; his father would die if he leave he .      but you tell your servant , unless your young brother come down with you , you shall not see I again .        when we return to your servant my father , we report to he the word of my lord .     later , our father say , go back and buy some food for we .      so we remind he , we can not go down there ; only if our young brother be with we can we go , for we may not see the man if our young brother be not with we .      then your servant my father say to we , as you know , my wife bear I two son .      one of they , however , have go away from I , and I say , he must have be tear to piece by wild beast ! I have not see he since .        if you take this one away from I too , and a disaster befall he , you will send my white head down to Sheol in grief .     so now , if the boy be not with we when I go back to your servant my father , whose very life be bind up with his , he will die as soon as he see that the boy be missing ;      and your servant will thus send the white head of your servant our father down to Sheol in grief .      besides , I , your servant , have guarantee the boy safety for my father by say , if I fail to bring he back to you , father , I will bear the blame before you forever .        so now let I , your servant , remain in place of the boy as the slave of my lord , and let the boy go back with his brother .      how could I go back to my father if the boy be not with I ? I could not bear to see the anguish that would overcome my father .             '
