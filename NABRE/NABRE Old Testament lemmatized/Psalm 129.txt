b ' against Israels enemy   a song of ascent . I Viciously have they attack I from my youth ,   let Israel say now .    Viciously have they attack I from my youth ,    yet they have not prevail against I .   upon my back the plower plow ,   as they trace their long furrow .    but the just   Lord   cut I free   from the rope of the wicked .     II   may they recoil in disgrace ,   all who hate Zion .   may they be like grass on the rooftop    wither in early growth ,    never to fill the reaper hand ,   nor the arm of the binder of sheaf ,   and with none pass by to call out :   the blessing of the   Lord   be upon you !    we bless you in the name of the   Lord !
