b '   judgment and Deliverance of Jerusalem   ah ! Ariel , Ariel ,    city where David encamp ! let year follow year ,   and feast follow feast ,    but I will bring distress upon Ariel ,   and there will be mourn and moaning . you shall be to I like Ariel :     I will encamp like David against you ; I will circle you with outpost   and set up siege work against you .    you shall speak from beneath the earth ,   and from the dust below , your word shall come . your voice shall be that of a ghost from the earth ,   and your word shall whisper from the dust .    the horde of your arrogant shall be like fine dust ,   a horde of tyrant like fly chaff .   then suddenly , in an instant ,    you shall be visit by the   Lord   of host , with thunder , earthquake , and great noise ,   whirlwind , storm , and the flame of consume fire .     then like a dream ,   a vision of the night , shall be the horde of all the nation   who make war against Ariel : all the outpost , the siege work against it ,   all who distress it .   as when a hungry man dream he be eat   and awaken with an empty stomach , or when a thirsty man dream he be drink   and awaken faint , his throat parch , so shall the horde of all the nation be ,   who make war against Mount Zion .    Blindness and perversity    Stupefy yourself and stay stupid ;   blind yourself and stay blind ! you who be drunk , but not from wine ,   who stagger , but not from strong drink !    for the   Lord   have pour out on you   a spirit of deep sleep . he have shut your eye ( the prophet )   and cover your head ( the seer ) .       for you the vision of all this have become like the word of a seal scroll . when it be hand to one who can read , with the request , read this , the reply be , I can not , because it be seal .      when the scroll be hand to one who can not read , with the request , read this , the reply be , I can not read .      the Lord say : since this people draw near with word only   and honor I with their lip alone ,   though their heart be far from I , and fear of I have become   mere precept of human teaching ,    therefore I will again deal with this people   in surprising and wondrous fashion : the wisdom of the wise shall perish ,   the prudence of the prudent shall vanish .    ah ! you who would hide a plan   too deep for the   Lord ! who work in the dark , say ,   who see we , who know we ?    your perversity be as though the potter   be take to be the clay : as though what be make should say of its maker ,   he do not make I ! or the vessel should say of the potter ,   he do not understand .     redemption    surely , in a very little while ,   Lebanon shall be change into an orchard ,   and the orchard be consider a forest !    on that day the deaf shall hear   the word of a scroll ; and out of gloom and darkness ,   the eye of the blind shall see .    the lowly shall again find joy in the   Lord ,   the poor rejoice in the Holy One of Israel .    for the tyrant shall be no more ,   the scoffer shall cease to be ; all who be ready for evil shall be cut off ,     those who condemn with a mere word , who ensnare the defender at the gate ,   and leave the just with an empty claim .    therefore thus say the   Lord ,   the God of the house of Jacob ,   who redeem Abraham :   no long shall Jacob be ashamed ,   no long shall his face grow pale .    for when his child see   the work of my hand in his midst , they shall sanctify my name ;   they shall sanctify the Holy One of Jacob ,   be in awe of the God of Israel .    those who err in spirit shall acquire understanding ,   those who find fault shall receive instruction .
