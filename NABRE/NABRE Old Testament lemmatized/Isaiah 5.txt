b '   the Song of the Vineyard    now let I sing of my friend ,   my beloveds song about his vineyard . my friend have a vineyard   on a fertile hillside ;   he spade it , clear it of stone ,   and plant the choice vine ; within it he build a watchtower ,   and hew out a wine press . then he wait for the crop of grape ,   but it yield rotten grape .    now , inhabitant of Jerusalem , people of Judah ,   judge between I and my vineyard :   what more could be do for my vineyard   that I do not do ?   why , when I wait for the crop of grape ,   do it yield rotten grape ?   now , I will let you know   what I be go to do to my vineyard : take away its hedge , give it to grazing ,   break through its wall , let it be trample !    yes , I will make it a ruin :   it shall not be prune or hoe ,   but will be overgrown with thorn and brier ; I will command the cloud   not to rain upon it .   the vineyard of the   Lord   of host be the house of Israel ,   the people of Judah , his cherish plant ; he wait for judgment , but see , bloodshed !   for justice , but hark , the outcry !     Oracles of Reproach     ah ! those who join house to house ,   who connect field with field , until no space remain , and you alone dwell   in the midst of the land !    in my hearing the   Lord   of host have swear :    many house shall be in ruin ,   house large and fine , with nobody live there .    ten acre of vineyard   shall yield but one bath ,   and a homer of seed   shall yield but an ephah .    ah ! those who rise early in the morning   in pursuit of strong drink , linger late   inflame by wine ,   banquet on wine with harp and lyre ,   timbrel and flute ,   but the deed of the   Lord   they do not regard ,   the work of his hand they do not see !    therefore my people go into exile   for lack of understanding ,   its noble starve ,   its masse parch with thirst .   therefore Sheol enlarge its throat   and open its mouth beyond measure ;   down into it go nobility and masse ,   tumult and revelry .   all shall be abase , each one bring low ,   and the eye of the haughty lower ,    but the   Lord   of host shall be exalt by judgment ,   by justice the Holy God show holy .    Lambs shall graze as at pasture ,   young goat shall eat in the ruin of the rich .   ah ! those who tug at guilt with cord of perversity ,   and at sin as if with cart rope !    who say , let he make haste ,   let he speed his work , that we may see it ; on with the plan of the Holy One of Israel !   let it come to pass , that we may know it !    ah ! those who call evil good , and good evil ,   who change darkness to light , and light into darkness ,   who change bitter to sweet , and sweet into bitter !    ah ! those who be wise in their own eye ,   prudent in their own view !    ah ! those who be champion at drink wine ,   master at mix drink !   those who acquit the guilty for bribe ,   and deprive the innocent of justice !    therefore , as the tongue of fire lick up stubble ,   as dry grass shrivel in the flame , their root shall rot   and their blossom scatter like dust ; for they have reject the instruction of the   Lord   of host ,   and scorn the word of the Holy One of Israel .      therefore the wrath of the   Lord   blaze against his people ,   he stretch out his hand to strike they ; the mountain quake ,    their corpse shall be like refuse in the street . for all this , his wrath be not turn back ,   his hand be still outstretche .    Invasion    he will raise a signal to a far - off nation ,   and whistle for it from the end of the earth .    then speedily and promptly they will come .   none among they be weary , none stumble ,   none will slumber , none will sleep . none with waist belt loose ,   none with sandal thong break .   their arrow be sharp ,   and all their bow be bent , the hoof of their horse like flint ,   and their chariot wheel like the whirlwind .   they roar like the lion ,   like young lion , they roar ; they growl and seize the prey ,   they carry it off and none can rescue .   they will growl over it , on that day ,   like the growling of the sea , look to the land\xe2\x80\x94   darkness close in ,   the light dark with cloud !
