b '   Devastation and Rescue of Jerusalem .      a day be come for the   Lord   when the spoil take from you will be divide in your midst .      and I will gather all the nation against Jerusalem for battle : the city will be take , house will be plunder , woman rape ; half the city will go into exile , but the rest of the people will not be remove from the city .      then the   Lord   will go forth and fight against those nation , fight as on a day of battle .        on that day Gods foot will stand    on the Mount of Olives , which be opposite Jerusalem to the east . the Mount of Olives will be split in two from east to west by a very deep valley ,    and half of the mountain will move to the north and half of it to the south .      you will flee by the valley between the mountain , for the valley between the mountain will reach to Azal . thus you will flee as you flee because of the earthquake    in the day of Uzziah king of Judah .    then the   Lord , my God , will come , and all his holy one with he .     Jerusalem restore .     on that day there will no long be cold or frost .      there will be one continuous day\xe2\x80\x94it be know to the   Lord \xe2\x80\x94not day and night , for in the evening there will be light .      on that day , fresh water will flow from Jerusalem ,    half to the eastern sea , and half to the western sea . this will be so in summer and in winter .      the   Lord   will be king over the whole earth ;    on that day the   Lord   will be the only one , and the   Lord s name the only one .      all the land will turn into a plain , from Geba to Rimmon , south of Jerusalem , which will stand exalted in its place\xe2\x80\x94from the Gate of Benjamin to the place of the first gate , to the Corner Gate and from the Tower of Hananel to the king wine press .      the city will be inhabit ; never again will it be doom . Jerusalem will dwell securely .     the Fate of Jerusalems Foes .     and this will be the plague with which the   Lord   will strike all the people that have fight against Jerusalem : their flesh will rot while they stand on their foot , and their eye will rot in their socket , and their tongue will rot in their mouth .        on that day a great panic from the   Lord   will be upon they .    they will seize each other hand , and their hand will be raise against each other .      even Judah will fight against Jerusalem . the rich of all the surround nation will be gather together\xe2\x80\x94gold , silver , and garments\xe2\x80\x94 in great abundance .      like the plague on human being will be the plague upon the horse , mule , camel , donkey , and upon all the beast that be in those camp .    the Future : Jerusalem , Judah , and the Nations .     everyone who be leave of all the nation that come against Jerusalem will go up year after year to bow down to the King , the   Lord   of host , and to celebrate the feast of booth .         should any of the family of the earth    not go up to Jerusalem to bow down to the King , the   Lord   of host , then there will be no rain for they .      and if the family of Egypt do not go up or enter , upon they will fall the plague ,    with which the   Lord   strike the nation that do not go up to celebrate the feast of booth .      this will be the punishment of Egypt and the punishment of all the nation that do not go up to celebrate the feast of booth .     on that day , Holy to the   Lord     will be write on the horse bell .    the pot in the house of the   Lord   will be as the basin before the altar .      every pot    in Jerusalem and in Judah will be holy to the   Lord   of host . all who come to sacrifice will take they and cook in they . no long will there be merchant in the house of the   Lord   of host on that day .
