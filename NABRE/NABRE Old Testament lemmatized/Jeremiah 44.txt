b '    the word that come to Jeremiah for all the Judahites who be live in Egypt , those live in Migdol , Tahpanhes , and Memphis , and in Upper Egypt :       thus say the   Lord   of host , the God of Israel : you yourself have see all the evil I bring upon Jerusalem and the other city of Judah . today they lie in ruin uninhabited ,        because of the evil they do to provoke I , go after other god , offer incense and serve other god they do not know , neither they , nor you , nor your ancestor .        though I repeatedly send you all my servant the prophet , say : you must not commit this abominable deed I hate ,      they do not listen or incline their ear in order to turn from their evil , no long offer incense to other god .        therefore the fury of my anger pour forth and kindle fire in the city of Judah and the street of Jerusalem , to turn they into the ruin wasteland they be today .     now thus say the   Lord   God of host , the God of Israel : why inflict so great an evil upon yourself , cut off from Judah man and woman , child and infant , not leave yourselves even a remnant ?      why do you provoke I with the work of your hand , offer sacrifice to other god here in the land of Egypt where you have come to live ? will you cut yourselves off and become a curse , a reproach among all the nation of the earth ?        have you forget the evil of your ancestor , the evil of the king of Judah , the evil of their wife , and your own evil and the evil of your wives\xe2\x80\x94all that they do in the land of Judah and in the street of Jerusalem ?        to this day they have not be crush down , nor have they show fear . they have not follow my law and my statute that I set before you and your ancestor .      therefore , thus say the   Lord   of host , the God of Israel : I have set my face against you for evil , to cut off all Judah .      I will take away the remnant of Judah who insist on go to the land of Egypt to live there ; in the land of Egypt they shall meet their end . they shall fall by the sword or be consume by hunger . from the least to the great , they shall die by sword or hunger ; they shall become a malediction , a horror , a curse , a reproach .        thus I will punish those who live in Egypt , just as I punish Jerusalem , with sword , hunger , and disease ,      so that none of the remnant of Judah who come to live in the land of Egypt shall escape or survive .    no one shall return to the land of Judah . even though they long to return and live there , they shall not return except as refugee .     they answer jeremiah\xe2\x80\x94all the man who know that their wife be offer sacrifice to other god , all the woman stand there in the immense crowd , and all the people who live in Lower and Upper Egypt :      regard the word you have speak to we in the name of the   Lord , we be not listen to you .        rather we will go on do what we propose ; we will offer incense to the queen of Heaven and pour out libation to she , just as we have do , along with our ancestor , our king and prince , in the city of Judah and in the street of Jerusalem . then we have plenty to eat , we prosper , and we suffer no misfortune .        but ever since we stop offer sacrifice to the queen of Heaven and pour out libation to she , we lack everything and be be destroy by sword and hunger .      and the woman say , when we offer sacrifice to the queen of Heaven and pour out libation to she , do we bake cake in her image and pour out libation to she without our husband consent ?      to all the people , man and woman , who give he this answer , Jeremiah say :      as for the sacrifice you offer in the city of Judah and in the street of Jerusalem\xe2\x80\x94you , your ancestor , your king and prince , and the people of the land\xe2\x80\x94did not the   Lord   remember they ? do it not enter his mind ?        the   Lord   could no long bear the evil of your deed , the abomination you be do ; then your land become a waste , a horror , a curse , without even one inhabitant , as it be today .        because you offer sacrifice and sin against the   Lord , not listen to the voice of the   Lord , not follow his law , his statute , and his decree , therefore this evil have overtake you , as it be today .      Jeremiah say to all the people and to all the woman : hear the word of the   Lord , all you judahite in the land of Egypt :      thus say the   Lord   of host , the God of Israel : you and your wife have carry out with your hand what your mouth have speak : we will go on fulfil the vow we have make to offer sacrifice to the queen of Heaven and to pour out libation to she . very well ! keep your vow , fulfill your vow !      and then listen to the word of the   Lord , all you judahite live in Egypt ; I swear by my own great name , say the   Lord : in the whole land of Egypt , my name shall no long be pronounce by the lip of any Judahite , say , as the Lord   God   live .      I be watch over they for evil , not for good . all the Judahites in Egypt shall come to an end by sword or famine until they be completely destroy .        those who escape the sword to return from the land of Egypt to the land of Judah shall be few in number . the whole remnant of Judah who come to Egypt to live shall know whose word stand , mine or theirs .      and this shall be a sign to you\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord \xe2\x80\x94i will punish you in this place so that you will know that my word stand solidly against you for evil .      thus say the   Lord : see ! I will hand over Pharaoh Hophra ,    king of Egypt , to his enemy , to those seek his life , just as I hand over Zedekiah , king of Judah , to his enemy Nebuchadrezzar , king of Babylon , to the one seek his life .
