b ' hymn of a Grateful Heart   of David . I I thank you , Lord , with all my heart ;    in the presence of the angel    to you I sing .   I bow low toward your holy temple ;   I praise your name for your mercy and faithfulness . for you have exalt over all   your name and your promise .   on the day I cry out , you answer ;   you strengthen my spirit .    II   all the king of earth will praise you ,   Lord ,   when they hear the word of your mouth .   they will sing of the way of the   Lord :   how great be the glory of the   Lord !   the   Lord   be on high , but care for the lowly    and know the proud from afar .   though I walk in the midst of danger ,   you guard my life when my enemy rage . you stretch out your hand ;   your right hand save I .   the   Lord   be with I to the end .   Lord , your mercy endure forever .   never forsake the work of your hand !             '
