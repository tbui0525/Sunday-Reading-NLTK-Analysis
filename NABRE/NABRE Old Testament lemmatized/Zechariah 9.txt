b '   Restoration of the Land of Israel    an oracle :    the word of the   Lord   be against the land of Hadrach ,   and Damascus be its destination , for the city of Aram be the   Lord s ,   as be all the tribe of Israel .   Hamath also on its border ,   Tyre too , and Sidon , no matter how clever they be .   Tyre build itself a stronghold ,   and heap up silver like dust ,   and gold like the mud of the street .   but now the Lord will dispossess it ,   and cast its wealth into the sea ,   and it will be devour by fire .   Ashkelon will see it and be afraid ;   Gaza too will be in great anguish ;   Ekron also , for its hope will wither . the king will disappear from Gaza ,   Ashkelon will not be inhabit ,    and the illegitimate will rule in Ashdod . I will destroy the pride of the Philistines    and take from their mouth their bloody prey ,   their disgusting meat from between their tooth . they will become merely a remnant for our God ,    and will be like a clan in Judah ;   Ekron will be like the Jebusites .    I will encamp at my house ,   a garrison against invader ; no oppressor will overrun they again ,   for now I have see their affliction .    the Kings Entry into Jerusalem    Exult greatly , o daughter Zion !   shout for joy , o daughter Jerusalem ! behold : your king    be come to you ,   a just savior be he , Humble , and ride on a donkey ,   on a colt , the foal of a donkey .    he shall banish the chariot from Ephraim ,    and the horse from Jerusalem ; the warrior bow will be banish ,   and he will proclaim peace to the nation .   his dominion will be from sea to sea ,   and from the River    to the end of the earth .     Restoration of the People   as for you , by the blood of your covenant ,     I have free your prisoner from a waterless pit .   return to a fortress ,    o prisoner of hope ; this very day , I announce   I be restore double to you .   for I have bend Judah as my bow ,   I have set Ephraim as its arrow ; I will arouse your son , o Zion ,   against your son , o Yavan ,    and I will use you as a warrior sword .   the   Lord   will appear over they ,   Gods arrow will shoot forth as lightning ; the Lord   God   will sound the ram horn ,   and come in a storm from the south .    the   Lord   of host will protect they ;   they will devour and conquer with sle stone ,   they will drink and become heat as with wine ;   they will be full like bowls\xe2\x80\x94like the corner of the altar .    and the   Lord   their God will save they :   the people , like a flock on that day ;   for like gemstone of a crown    they will shine on the land .   then how good and how lovely !   grain will make the young man flourish ,   and new wine the young woman .
