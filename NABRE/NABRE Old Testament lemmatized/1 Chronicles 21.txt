b '   Davids Census ; the plague .      a satan    rise up against Israel , and he incite David to take a census of Israel .        David therefore say to Joab and to the other general of the army , go , number the Israelites from Beer - sheba to Dan , and report back to I that I may know their number .      but Joab reply : may the   Lord   increase his people a hundredfold ! my lord king , be not all of they my lord subject ? why do my lord seek to do this thing ? why should he bring guilt upon Israel ?      however , the king command prevail over Joab , who depart and traverse all of Israel , and then return to Jerusalem .      Joab report the census figure to David : of man capable of wield a sword , there be in all Israel one million one hundred thousand , and in Judah four hundred and seventy thousand .      Levi and Benjamin , however , he do not include in the census , for the king command be repugnant to Joab .        this command be evil in the sight of God , and he strike Israel .      then David say to God , I have sin greatly in do this thing . take away your servant guilt , for I have act very foolishly .     then the   Lord   speak to Gad , Davids seer , in these word :        go , tell David : thus say the   Lord : I be lay out three option ; choose one of they , and I will inflict it on you .      accordingly , Gad go to David and say to he : thus say the   Lord : decide now\xe2\x80\x94      will it be three year of famine ; or three month of flee your enemy , with the sword of your foe ever at your back ; or three day of the   Lord s own sword , a plague in the land , with the   Lord s destroy angel in every part of Israel ? now consider : what answer be I to give he who send I ?      then David say to Gad : I be in serious trouble . but let I fall into the hand of the   Lord , whose mercy be very great , rather than into hand of man .     therefore the   Lord   send a plague upon Israel , and seventy thousand Israelites die .      God also send an angel to Jerusalem to destroy it ; but as the angel be on the point of destroy it , the   Lord   see and change his mind about the calamity , and say to the destroy angel , enough now ! stay your hand !   Ornans Threshing Floor .   the angel of the   Lord   be then stand by the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite .      when David raise his eye , he see the angel of the   Lord   stand between earth and heaven , draw sword in hand stretch out against Jerusalem .    David and the elder , clothe in sackcloth , fall face down ,      and David pray to God : be it not I who order the census of the people ? I be the one who sin , I do this wicked thing . but these sheep , what have they do ? o   Lord , my God , strike I and my father family , but do not afflict your people with this plague !     then the angel of the   Lord   command Gad to tell David to go up and set up an altar to the   Lord   on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite .        David go up at the word of Gad , which he speak in the name of the   Lord .      Ornan turn around and see the king ; his four son who be with he hide themselves , but Ornan keep on threshing wheat .      but as David come toward Ornan , he look up and see that it be David , and leave the threshing floor and bow down before David , his face to the ground .      David say to Ornan : sell I the site of this threshing floor , that I may build on it an altar to the   Lord . sell it to I at its full price , that the plague may be withdraw from the people .      but Ornan say to David : take it as your own , and let my lord the king do what be good in his sight . see , I also give you the oxen for the burn offering , the threshing sledge for the wood , and the wheat for the grain offering . I give it all to you .      but King David reply to Ornan : no ! I will buy it from you properly , at its full price . I will not take what be yours for the   Lord , nor bring burn offering that cost I nothing .      so David pay Ornan six hundred shekel of gold    for the place .    Altar for Burnt Offerings .     David then build an altar there to the   Lord , and sacrifice burn offering and communion offering . he call upon the   Lord , who answer he by send down fire from heaven upon the altar for burn offering .        then the   Lord   give order to the angel to return his sword to its sheath .     once David see that the   Lord   have answer he at the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite , he continue to offer sacrifice there .      the tabernacle of the   Lord , which Moses have make in the wilderness , and the altar for burn offering be at that time on the high place at Gibeon .        but David could not go into his presence to inquire of God , for he be fearful of the sword of the angel of the   Lord .
