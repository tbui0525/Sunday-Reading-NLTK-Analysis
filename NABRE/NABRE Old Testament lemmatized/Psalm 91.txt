b ' security under Gods Protection I   you who dwell in the shelter of the most high ,    who abide in the shade of the Almighty ,   say to the   Lord , my refuge and fortress ,   my God in whom I trust .    he will rescue you from the fowler snare ,   from the destroy plague ,   he will shelter you with his pinion ,   and under his wing you may take refuge ;    his faithfulness be a protect shield .   you shall not fear the terror of the night   nor the arrow that fly by day ,    nor the pestilence that roam in darkness ,   nor the plague that ravage at noon .    though a thousand fall at your side ,   ten thousand at your right hand ,   near you it shall not come .   you need simply watch ;   the punishment of the wicked you will see .    because you have the   Lord   for your refuge   and have make the most high your stronghold ,   no evil shall befall you ,   no affliction come near your tent .     for he command his angel with regard to you ,    to guard you wherever you go .    with their hand they shall support you ,   lest you strike your foot against a stone .    you can tread upon the asp and the viper ,   trample the lion and the dragon .     II   because he cling to I I will deliver he ;   because he know my name I will set he on high .    he will call upon I and I will answer ;    I will be with he in distress ;    I will deliver he and give he honor .   with length of day I will satisfy he ,   and fill he with my saving power .
