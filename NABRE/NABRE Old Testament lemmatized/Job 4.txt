b '   Eliphazs First Speech .     then Eliphaz the Temanite answer and say :     if someone attempt a word with you , would you mind ?   how can anyone refrain from speak ?   look , you have instruct many ,   and make firm their feeble hand .   your word have uphold the stumbler ;   you have strengthen falter knee .   but now that it come to you , you be impatient ;   when it touch you , you be dismay .   be not your piety a source of confidence ,   and your integrity of life your hope ?   reflect now , what innocent person perish ?    where be the upright destroy ?   as I see it , those who plow mischief   and sow trouble will reap they .   by the breath of God they perish ,    and by the blast of his wrath they be consume .   though the lion    roar , though the king of beast cry out ,   yet the tooth of the young lion be break ;   the old lion perishe for lack of prey ,   and the cub of the lioness be scatter .   a word be stealthily bring to I ,    my ear catch a whisper of it .   in my thought during vision of the night ,    when deep sleep fall on mortal ,   Fear come upon I , and shudder ,   that terrify I to the bone .   then a spirit pass before I ,   and the hair of my body stand on end .   it pause , but its likeness I could not recognize ;   a figure be before my eye ,   in silence I hear a voice :    can anyone be more in the right than God ?    can mortal be more blameless than their maker ?   look , he put no trust in his servant ,    and even with his messenger he find fault .   how much more with those who dwell in house of clay ,   whose foundation be in the dust ,   who be crush more easily than a moth !   Morning or evening they may be shatter ;   unnoticed , they perish forever .   the peg of their tent be pluck up ;   they die without know wisdom .             '
