b '   true and false worship     thus say the   Lord : the heaven be my throne ,   the earth , my footstool . what house can you build for I ?   where be the place of my rest ?    my hand make all these thing   when all of they come to be\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord . this be the one whom I approve :   the afflict one , crush in spirit ,   who tremble at my word .     the one slaughter an ox , strike a man ,   sacrifice a lamb , break a dog neck , make an offering of pig blood ,   burn incense , honor an idol\xe2\x80\x94 these have choose their own way ,   and take pleasure in their own abomination .    I in turn will choose affliction for they   and bring upon they what they fear . because when I call , no one answer ,   when I speak , no one listen . because they do what be evil in my sight ,   and thing I do not delight in they choose ,    hear the word of the   Lord ,   you who tremble at his word ! your kin who hate you   and cast you out because of my name say , may the   Lord   show his glory ,   that we may see your joy ;   but they shall be put to shame .   a voice roar from the city ,   a voice from the temple ; the voice of the   Lord   render recompense to his enemy !     blessing of Prosperity and Consolation    before she be in labor ,   she give birth ;   before her pang come upon she ,   she deliver a male child .   who ever hear of such a thing ,   or who ever see the like ? can a land be bring forth in one day ,   or a nation be bear in a single moment ? yet Zion be scarcely in labor   when she bear her child .   shall I bring a mother to the point of birth ,   and yet not let her child be bear ? say the   Lord . or shall I who bring to birth   yet close her womb ? say your God .    rejoice with Jerusalem and be glad because of she ,   all you who love she ; rejoice with she in her joy ,   all you who mourn over her\xe2\x80\x94    so that you may nurse and be satisfied   from her consoling breast ; that you may drink with delight   at her abundant breast !    for thus say the   Lord : I will spread prosperity over she like a river ,   like an overflowing torrent ,   the wealth of nation . you shall nurse , carry in her arm ,   cradle upon her knee ;   as a mother comfort her child ,   so I will comfort you ;   in Jerusalem you shall find your comfort .    you will see and your heart shall exult ,   and your body shall flourish like the grass ; the   Lord s power shall be reveal to his servant ,   but to his enemy , his wrath .   for see , the   Lord   will come in fire ,   his chariot like the stormwind ; to wreak his anger in burn rage   and his rebuke in fiery flame .   for with fire the   Lord   shall enter into judgment ,   and , with his sword , against all flesh ;   those slay by the   Lord   shall be many .       those who sanctify and purify themselves to go into the garden , follow one who stand within , eat pig flesh , abominable thing , and mouse , shall all together come to an end , with their deed and purposes\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord .    God Gathers the Nations .      I be come to gather all nation and tongue ; they shall come and see my glory .        I will place a sign among they ; from they I will send survivor to the nation : to Tarshish , put and Lud , Mosoch , Tubal and Javan , to the distant coastland which have never hear of my fame , or see my glory ; and they shall proclaim my glory among the nation .      they shall bring all your kin from all the nation as an offering to the   Lord , on horse and in chariot , in cart , upon mule and dromedary , to Jerusalem , my holy mountain , say the   Lord , just as the Israelites bring their grain offering in a clean vessel to the house of the   Lord .      some of these I will take as priest and levite , say the   Lord .     just as the new heaven and the new earth   which I be make shall endure before me\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord \xe2\x80\x94   so shall your descendant and your name endure .    from new moon to new moon ,   and from sabbath to sabbath , all flesh shall come to worship   before I , say the   Lord .     they shall go out and see the corpse    of the people who rebel against I ; for their worm shall not die ,   their fire shall not be extinguish ;   and they shall be an abhorrence to all flesh .
