b ' chapter 24 judgment upon the World and the Lords Enthronement on Mount Zion    see ! the   Lord   be about to empty the earth and lie it waste ;   he will twist its surface ,   and scatter its inhabitant :    People and priest shall fare alike :   servant and master , Maid and mistress ,   buyer and seller , lender and borrower ,   creditor and debtor .    the earth shall be utterly lay waste , utterly strip ,   for the   Lord   have decree this word .   the earth mourn and fade ,   the world languish and fade ;   both heaven and earth languish .    the earth be polluted because of its inhabitant ,   for they have transgress law , violate statute ,   break the ancient covenant .     therefore a curse devour the earth ,   and its inhabitant pay for their guilt ; therefore they who dwell on earth have dwindle ,   and only a few be leave .    the new wine mourn , the vine languish ,   all the merry - hearted groan .    Stilled be the cheerful timbrel ,   end the shout of the jubilant ,   still the cheerful harp .    they no long drink wine and sing ;   strong brew be bitter to those who drink it .    break down be the city of chaos ,    every house be shut against entry .    in the street they cry out for lack of wine ;   all joy have grow dim ,   cheer be exile from the land .    in the city nothing remain but desolation ,   gate batter into ruin .   for thus it shall be in the midst of the earth ,   among the people , as when an olive tree have be beat ,   as with a gleaning when the vintage be do .    these    shall lift up their voice ,   they shall sing for joy in the majesty of the   Lord ,   they shall shout from the western sea :   therefore , in the east   give glory to the   Lord ! in the coastland of the sea ,   to the name of the   Lord , the God of Israel !    from the end of the earth we hear song :   Splendor to the just one ! but I say , I be waste , waste away .   Woe be I ! the traitor betray ;   with treachery have the traitor betray !    Terror , pit , and trap   for you , inhabitant of the earth !    one who flee at the sound of terror   will fall into the pit ; one who climb out of the pit   will be catch in the trap . for the window on high be open   and the foundation of the earth shake .    the earth will burst asunder ,   the earth will be shake apart ,   the earth will be convulse .   the earth will reel like a drunkard ,   sway like a hut ; its rebellion will weigh it down ;   it will fall , never to rise again .    on that day the   Lord   will punish   the host of the heaven    in the heavens ,   and the king of the earth on the earth .   they will be gather together   like prisoner into a pit ; they will be shut up in a dungeon ,   and after many day they will be punish .    then the moon will blush   and the sun be ashamed ,   for the   Lord   of host will reign   on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem ,   glorious in the sight of the elder .
