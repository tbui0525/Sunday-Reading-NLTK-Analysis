Jehoiada say to they : here be the king son who must reign , as the   Lord   promise concern the son of David .      this be what you must do : a third of your number , both priest and levite , who come on duty on the sabbath must guard the threshold ,      another third must be at the king house , and the final third at the Foundation Gate , when all the people will be in the court of the   Lord s house .      let no one enter the   Lord s house except the priest and those Levites who be minister . they may enter because they be holy ; but all the other people must observe the prescription of the   Lord .      the Levites shall surround the king on all side , each with draw weapon . whoever try to enter the house be to be kill . stay with the king wherever he go .     the Levites and all Judah do just as Jehoiada the priest command . each take his troop , both those go on duty for the week and those go off duty that week , since Jehoiada the priest have not dismiss any of the division .
