b '   the Twelve Scouts .     the   Lord   say to Moses :      send man to reconnoiter the land of Canaan , which I be give the Israelites . you shall send one man from each ancestral tribe , every one a leader among they .       so Moses send they from the wilderness of Paran , at the direction of the   Lord . all of they be leader among the Israelites .      these be their name : from the tribe of Reuben , Shammua , son of Zaccur ;     from the tribe of Simeon , Shaphat , son of Hori ;     from the tribe of Judah , Caleb , son of Jephunneh ;     from the tribe of Issachar , Igal ;     for the Josephites , from the tribe of Ephraim , Hoshea , son of Nun ;     from the tribe of Benjamin , Palti , son of Raphu ;     from the tribe of Zebulun , Gaddiel , son of Sodi ;     for the Josephites , from the tribe of Manasseh , Gaddi , son of Susi ;     from the tribe of Dan , Ammiel , son of Gemalli ;     from the tribe of Asher , Sethur , son of Michael ;     from the tribe of Naphtali , Nahbi , son of Vophsi ;     from the tribe of Gad , Geuel , son of Machi .     these be the name of the man whom Moses send to reconnoiter the land . but Hoshea , son of Nun , Moses call Joshua .      in send they to reconnoiter the land of Canaan , Moses say to they , go up there in the Negeb , up into the highland ,      and see what kind of land it be and whether the people live there be strong or weak , few or many .      be the country in which they live good or bad ? be the town in which they dwell open or fortified ?      be the soil fertile or barren , wooded or clear ? and do your good to get some of the fruit of the land . it be then the season for early grape .     so they go up and reconnoiter the land from the wilderness of Zin    as far as where Rehob adjoin Lebo - hamath .       go up by way of the Negeb , they reach Hebron , where Ahiman , Sheshai and Talmai , descendant of the Anakim ,    be . ( now Hebron have be build seven year before Zoan in Egypt . )      they also reach the Wadi Eshcol ,    where they cut down a branch with a single cluster of grape on it , which two of they carry on a pole , as well as some pomegranate and fig .      it be because of the cluster the Israelites cut there that they call the place Wadi Eshcol .     their Report .     they return from reconnoiter the land forty day later .       proceed directly to Moses and Aaron and the whole community of the Israelites in the wilderness of Paran at Kadesh , they make a report to they and to the whole community , show they the fruit of the land .      they tell Moses : we come to the land to which you send we . it do indeed flow with milk and honey , and here be its fruit .      however , the people who be live in the land be powerful , and the town be fortified and very large .    besides , we see descendant of the Anakim there .      amalekite live in the region of the Negeb ; Hittites , Jebusites and Amorites dwell in the highland , and Canaanites along the sea and the bank of the Jordan .     Caleb , however , quiet the people before Moses and say , we ought to go up and seize the land , for we can certainly prevail over it .      but the man who have go up with he say , we can not attack these people ; they be too strong for we .      they spread discourage report    among the Israelites about the land they have reconnoiter , say , the land that we go through and reconnoiter be a land that consume its inhabitant . and all the people we see there be huge .       there we see the Nephilim    ( the Anakim be from the Nephilim ) ; in our own eye we seem like mere grasshopper , and so we must have seem to they .
