b '    Ahithophel go on to say to Absalom : let I choose twelve thousand man and be off in pursuit of David tonight .      if I come upon he when he be weary and discourage , I shall cause he panic , and all the people with he will flee , and I shall strike down the king alone .      then I can bring back the rest of the people to you , as a bride return to her husband . it be the death of only one man you be seek ; then all the people will be at peace .      this plan sound good to Absalom and to all the elder of Israel .    Counsel of Hushai .     then Absalom say , now call Hushai the Archite also ; let we hear what he too have to say .      when Hushai come to Absalom , Absalom say to he : this be Ahithophels plan . shall we follow his plan ? if not , give your own .      Hushai reply to Absalom , this time Ahithophel have not give good counsel .      and he go on to say : you know that your father and his man be warrior , and that they be as fierce as a bear in the wild rob of her cub . moreover , since your father be a skilled fighter , he will not spend the night with the army .        even now he lie hide in one of the cave or in one of his other place . and if some of our soldier should fall at the first attack , whoever hear of it will say , Absaloms follower have be slaughter .      then even the brave man with the heart of a lion\xe2\x80\x94his heart will melt . for all Israel know that your father be a fighter and those who be with he be brave .      this be what I counsel : let all Israel be assemble , from Dan to Beer - sheba , as numerous as the sand by the sea , and you yourself go with they .      we can then attack he wherever we find he , settle down upon he as dew alight on the ground . none shall survive\xe2\x80\x94neither he nor any of his follower .      and if he retire into a city , all Israel shall bring rope to that city and we can drag it into the gorge , so that not even a pebble of it can be find .      then Absalom and all the Israelites say , the counsel of Hushai the Archite be well than the counsel of Ahithophel . for the   Lord   have command that Ahithophels good counsel should be thwart , so that he might bring Absalom to ruin .     David tell of the plan .     then Hushai say to the priest Zadok and Abiathar : this be the counsel Ahithophel give Absalom and the elder of Israel , and this be what I counsel .      so send a warning to David immediately : do not spend the night at the ford near the wilderness , but cross over without fail . otherwise the king and all the people with he will be destroy .      now Jonathan and Ahimaaz be stay at en - rogel . a maidservant be to come with information for they , and they in turn be to go and report to King David . they could not risk be see enter the city ,      but an attendant do see they and inform Absalom . they hurry on their way and reach the house of a man in Bahurim who have a cistern in his courtyard . they let themselves down into it ,      and the woman take the cover and spread it over the mouth of the cistern , strew crush grain on the cover so that nothing could be notice .      when Absaloms servant come to the woman at the house , they ask , where be Ahimaaz and Jonathan ? the woman reply , they go by a short while ago toward the water . they search , but find no one , and so return to Jerusalem .      as soon as they leave , Ahimaaz and Jonathan come up out of the cistern and go on to report to King David . they say to he : leave ! cross the water at once , for Ahithophel have give such and such counsel in regard to you .      so David and all his people move on and cross the Jordan . by daybreak , there be no one leave who have not cross .     when Ahithophel see that his counsel be not act upon , he saddle his donkey and depart , go to his home in his own city . then , having leave order concern his household , he hang himself . and so he die and be bury in his father tomb .      now David have arrive at Mahanaim while Absalom cross the Jordan accompany by all the Israelites .      Absalom have put Amasa in command of the army in Joabs place . Amasa be the son of an Ishmaelite name Ithra , who have marry Abigail , daughter of Jesse and sister of Joabs mother Zeruiah .        Israel and Absalom encamp in the land of Gilead .     when David come to Mahanaim , Shobi , son of Nahash from Rabbah of the Ammonites , Machir , son of Ammiel from Lodebar , and Barzillai , the Gileadite from Rogelim ,        bring bed and cover , basin and pottery , as well as wheat , barley , flour , roasted grain , bean , lentil ,      honey , and butter and cheese from the flock and herd , for David and those who be with he to eat ; for they say , the people will be hungry and tired and thirsty in the wilderness .
