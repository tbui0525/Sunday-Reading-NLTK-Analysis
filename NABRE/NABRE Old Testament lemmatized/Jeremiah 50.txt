b '   the first Oracle against Babylon .     the word the   Lord   speak against Babylon ,    against the land of the Chaldeans , through Jeremiah the prophet :      proclaim this among the nation , announce it !   announce it , do not hide it , but say : Babylon be capture , Bel    put to shame , Marduk terrify ;   its image be put to shame , its idol shatter .   a nation from the north advance against it ,   make the land desolate so that no one can live there ;   human being and animal have flee .    in those day and at that time\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord \xe2\x80\x94   Israelite and Judahite shall come together , weep as they come , to seek the   Lord , their God ;    they shall ask for Zion ,   seek out the way . come , let we join ourselves to the   Lord   in an everlasting covenant , never to be forget .    lost sheep be my people ,   their shepherd mislead they ,   lead they astray on the mountain ; from mountain to hill they wander ,   forget their fold .    whoever happen upon they devour they ;   their enemy say , we be not guilty , because they sin against the   Lord ,   the abode of justice , the hope of their ancestor .    Flee from the midst of Babylon ,   leave the land of the Chaldeans ,   be like ram at the head of the flock .    see , I be stir up against Babylon   a band of great nation from the land of the north ; they be array against she ,   from there she shall be take . their arrow be like the arrow of a skilled warrior   who never return empty - handed .    Chaldea shall become plunder ;   all its plunderer shall be enriched\xe2\x80\x94   oracle of the   Lord .   yes , rejoice and exult ,   you that plunder my heritage ; frisk like calf on the grass ,   neigh like stallion !   your mother will indeed be put to shame ,   she that bear you shall be abash ; see , the last of the nation ,   a wilderness , a dry wasteland .    because of the   Lord s wrath it shall be uninhabited ,   become an utter wasteland ; everyone who pass by Babylon will be appal   and hiss at all its wound .    take your post encircle Babylon ,   you who bend the bow ; shoot at it , do not spare your arrow ,     raise the war cry against it on every side . it surrender , its bastion fall ,   its wall be tear down :   this be retribution from the   Lord ! take retribution on she ,   as she have do , do to she ;   for she sin against the   Lord .    cut off the sower from Babylon   and those who wield sickle at harvest time ! before the destroy sword ,   all of they turn back to their own people ,   all flee to their own land .    Israel be a stray sheep   that lion pursue ; the king of Assyria once devour he ;   now Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon gnaw his bone .    therefore , thus say the   Lord   of host , the God of Israel : I will punish the king of Babylon and his land ,   as I once punish the king of Assyria ;    but I will bring Israel back to its pasture ,   to feed on Carmel and Bashan , and on Mount Ephraim and Gilead ,   until they have their fill .      in those day , at that time\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord : the guilt of Israel may be seek , but it no long exist ,   the sin of Judah , but it can no long be find ;   for I will forgive the remnant I preserve .    attack the land of Merathaim ,   and those who live in Pekod ;   Slaughter and put they under the ban\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord \xe2\x80\x94   do all I have command you .   Battle alarm in the land ,   great destruction !   how the hammer of the whole earth   have be cut off and break ! what an object of horror   Babylon have become among the nation !    you ensnare yourself and be catch ,   Babylon , before you know it ! you be discover and seize ,   because you challenge the   Lord .    the   Lord   open his armory ,   bring out the weapon of his wrath ; the Lord   God   of host have work to do   in the land of the Chaldeans .    come upon they from every side ,   open their granary , pile they up in heap and put they under the ban ;   do not leave a remnant .   Slay all the oxen ,   take they down to slaughter ; Woe to they ! their day have come ,   the time of their punishment .   listen ! the fugitive , the refugee   from the land of Babylon : they announce in Zion   the retribution of the   Lord , our God .    call archer out against Babylon ,   all who bend the bow ; encamp around they ;   let no one escape . repay they for their deed ;   what they have do , do to they , for they insult the   Lord ,   the Holy One of Israel .    therefore their young man shall fall in the square ,   all their warrior shall be still on that day\xe2\x80\x94   oracle of the   Lord .    I be against you , o insolence\xe2\x80\x94   oracle of the Lord   God   of host ; for your day have come ,   the time for I to punish you .   insolence stumble and fall ;   there be no one to raise he up . I will kindle a fire in his city   to devour everything around he .    thus say the   Lord   of host : oppress be the people of Israel ,   together with the people of Judah ; all their captor hold they fast   and refuse to let they go .   Strong be their Redeemer ,   whose name be   Lord   of host , the sure defender of their cause ,   who give rest to their land ,   but unrest to those who live in Babylon .    a sword upon the Chaldeans\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord \xe2\x80\x94   upon the inhabitant of Babylon , her prince and sage !   a sword upon the soothsayer ,   and they become fool ! a sword upon the warrior ,   and they tremble ;   a sword upon their motley throng ,   and they become woman ! a sword upon their treasure ,   and they be plunder ;    a drought upon the water ,   and they dry up ! for it be a land of idol ,   soon make frantic by phantom .    hence , wildcat shall dwell there with hyena ,   and ostrich occupy it ; never again shall it be inhabit or settle ,   from age to age .    as happen when God overturn Sodom   and Gomorrah and their neighbors\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord \xe2\x80\x94 no one shall dwell there ,   no mortal shall settle there .    see , a people come from the north ,   a great nation , and mighty king   rise from the end of the earth .    bow and javelin they wield ,   cruel and pitiless be they ; they sound like the roar sea ,   as they ride forth on horse , each in place for battle   against you , daughter Babylon .   the king of Babylon hear news of they ,   and his hand hang helpless ; Anguish take hold of he ,   like the pang of a woman give birth .    as happen when a lion come up from a thicket of the Jordan   to permanent pasture , so I , in an instant , will chase they off ,   and establish there whomever I choose ! for who be like I ? who can call I to account ?   what shepherd can stand against I ?    therefore , hear the strategy of the   Lord ,   which he have devise against Babylon ; hear the plan draw up   against the land of the Chaldeans : they shall be drag away , even the small sheep ;   their own pasture aghast because of they .    at the cry Babylon be capture ! the earth quake ;   the outcry be hear among the nation .
