b '    until like fire a prophet appear ,   his word a flame furnace .    the staff of life , their bread , he shatter ,   and in his zeal he make they few in number .   by Gods word he shut up the heaven   and three time bring down fire .    how awesome be you ,   Elijah !   whose glory be equal to yours ?   you bring a dead body back to life   from Sheol , by the will of the   Lord .    you send king down to destruction ,   and noble , from their bed of sickness .    you hear threat at Sinai ,   at Horeb avenge judgment .    you anoint the agent of these punishment ,   the prophet to succeed in your place .    you be take aloft in a whirlwind ,   in a chariot with fiery horse .    you be destine , it be write , in time to come   to put an end to wrath before the day of the   Lord , to turn back the heart of parent toward their child ,   and to re - establish the tribe of Israel .    bless be the one who shall have see you before he die !       when Elijah be envelop in the whirlwind , Elisha   be fill with his spirit ;   he work twice as many marvel ,    and every utterance of his mouth be wonderful . during his lifetime he fear no one ,   nor be anyone able to intimidate his will .   nothing be beyond his power ;    and from where he lie bury , his body prophesy .    in life he perform wonder ,   and after death , marvelous deed .   despite all this the people do not repent ,   nor do they give up their sin , until they be uproot from their land   and scatter all over the earth . Judah but Judah remain , a tiny people ,   with its ruler from the house of David .    some of they do what be right ,   but other be extremely sinful .    Hezekiah and Isaiah    Hezekiah   fortify his city   and have water bring into it ;   with bronze tool he cut through the rock   and dam up a mountain site for water .    during his reign Sennacherib lead an invasion   and send his adjutant ; he shake his fist at Zion   and blaspheme God in his pride .    the people heart melt within they ,   and they be in anguish like that of childbirth .   but they call upon the most high God   and lift up their hand to he ; he hear the prayer they utter ,   and save they through   Isaiah .    God strike the camp of the Assyrians   and route they with a plague .    for Hezekiah do what be right   and hold fast to the path of David , as order by the illustrious prophet   Isaiah , who see truth in vision .   in his lifetime he turn back the sun   and prolong the life of the king .    by his powerful spirit he look into the future    and console the mourner of Zion ;   he foretell what would happen till the end of time ,   hide thing yet to be fulfil .
