b ' an admonition to Fidelity   for the leader ; upon the   gittith .    of Asaph .    I   sing joyfully to God our strength ;    raise loud shout to the God of Jacob !   take up a melody , sound the timbrel ,   the pleasant lyre with a harp .    blow the shofar at the new moon ,   at the full moon , on our solemn feast .    for this be a law for Israel ,   an edict of the God of Jacob ,    he make it a decree for Joseph   when he come out of the land of Egypt .    II    I hear a tongue I do not know :   I remove his shoulder from the burden ;    his hand move away from the basket .    in distress you call and I rescue you ;   I answer you in secret with thunder ; at the water of Meribah    I test you :        listen , my people , I will testify against you Selah   if only you will listen to I , Israel !    there shall be no foreign god among you ;     you shall not bow down to an alien god .   I be the   Lord   your God ,   who bring you up from the land of Egypt .   open wide your mouth that I may fill it .   but my people do not listen to my word ;   Israel would not submit to I .   so I thrust they away to the hardness of their heart ;   let they walk in their own machination .    o that my people would listen to I ,   that Israel would walk in my way ,    in a moment I would humble their foe ,   and turn back my hand against their oppressor .    those who hate the   Lord   will try flatter he ,   but their fate be fix forever .   but Israel I will feed with the fine wheat ,   I will satisfy they with honey from the rock .
