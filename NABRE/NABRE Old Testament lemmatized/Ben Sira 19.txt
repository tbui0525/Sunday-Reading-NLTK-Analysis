b '    whoever do this grow no rich ;   those who waste the little they have will be strip bare .   Wine and woman make the heart lustful ,   and the companion of prostitute become reckless .    Rottenness and worm will possess he ,   and the reckless will be snatch away .    whoever trust other too quickly have a shallow mind ,   and those who sin wrong themselves .    the Proper Use of Speech    whoever gloat over evil will be destroy ,    and whoever repeat gossip have no sense .   never repeat gossip ,   and no one will reproach you .    tell nothing to friend or foe ;   and unless it be a sin for you , do not reveal a thing .    for someone may have hear you and watch you ,   and in time come to hate you .   let anything you hear die with you ;   never fear , it will not make you burst !   having hear something , the fool go into labor ,   like a woman give birth to a child .   like an arrow stick in a fool thigh ,   so be gossip in the belly of a fool .   admonish your friend\xe2\x80\x94he may not have do it ;   and if he do , that he may not do it again .    admonish your neighbor\xe2\x80\x94he may not have say it ;   and if he do , that he may not say it again .   admonish your friend\xe2\x80\x94often it may be slander ;   do not believe every story .   then , too , a person can slip and not mean it ;   who have not sin with his tongue ?    admonish your neighbor before you break with he ;   and give due place to the Law of the most high .      how to recognize true wisdom    all wisdom be fear of the   Lord ;   and in all wisdom , the observance of the Law .     the knowledge of wickedness be not wisdom ,   nor be there prudence in the counsel of sinner .   there be a shrewdness that be detestable ,   while the fool may be free from sin .   well be the God - fear who have little understanding   than those of great intelligence who violate the Law .     there be a shrewdness keen but dishonest ,   and there be those who be duplicitous to win a judgment .   there be the villain bow in grief ,   but full of deceit within .   he hide his face and pretend not to hear ,   but when not observe , he will take advantage of you :   even if his lack of strength keep he from sin ,   when he find the right time he will do harm .   People be know by their appearance ;   the sensible be recognize as such when first meet .   Ones attire , hearty laughter , and gait   proclaim he for what he be .             '
