b '    well to be poor and walk in integrity   than rich and crooked in one way .    Desire without knowledge be not good ;   and whoever act hastily , blunder .    their own folly lead people astray ;   in their heart they rage against the   Lord .    Wealth add many friend ,   but the poor be leave friendless .    the false witness will not go unpunished ,   and whoever utter lie will not escape .     many curry favor with a noble ;   everybody be a friend of a gift giver .   all the kin of the poor despise they ;   how much more do their friend shun they !    those who gain sense truly love themselves ;   those who preserve understanding will find success .    the false witness will not go unpunished ,   and whoever utter lie will perish .   Luxury be not befit a fool ;   much less should a slave rule over prince .   it be good sense to be slow to anger ,   and an honor to overlook an offense .    the king wrath be like the roar of a lion ,   but his favor , like dew on the grass .     the foolish son be ruin to his father ,    and a quarrelsome wife be water constantly dripping .    home and possession be an inheritance from parent ,   but a prudent wife be from the   Lord .    laziness bring on deep sleep ,   and the sluggard go hungry .    those who keep command keep their life ,   but those who despise these way will die .    whoever care for the poor lend to the   Lord ,    who will pay back the sum in full .   discipline your son , for there be hope ;   but do not be intent on his death .     a wrathful person bear the penalty ;   after one rescue , you will have it to do again .   listen to counsel and receive instruction ,   that you may eventually become wise .   many be the plan of the human heart ,   but it be the decision of the   Lord   that endure .    what be desire of a person be fidelity ;   rather be poor than a liar .    the fear of the   Lord   lead to life ;   one eat and sleep free from any harm .   the sluggard bury a hand in the dish ;   not even lift it to the mouth .    beat a scoffer and the naive learn a lesson ;   rebuke the intelligent and they gain knowledge .    whoever mistreat a father or drive away a mother ,   be a shameless and disgraceful child .     my son , stop attend to correction ;   start stray from word of knowledge .    an unprincipled witness scoff at justice ,   and the mouth of the wicked pour out iniquity .   rod be prepare for scoffer ,   and blow for the back of fool .
