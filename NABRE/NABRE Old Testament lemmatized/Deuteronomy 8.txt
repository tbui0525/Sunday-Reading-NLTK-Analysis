b '   Gods Care .     be careful to observe this whole commandment    that I enjoin on you today , that you may live and increase , and may enter in and possess the land which the   Lord   promise on oath to your ancestor .      remember how for these forty year the   Lord , your God , have direct all your journeying in the wilderness ,    so as to test you by affliction , to know what be in your heart : to keep his commandment , or not .      he therefore let you be afflict with hunger , and then feed you with manna ,    a food unknown to you and your ancestor , so you might know that it be not by bread alone    that people live , but by all that come forth from the mouth of the   Lord .      the clothing do not fall from you in tatter , nor do your foot swell these forty year .        so you must know in your heart that , even as a man discipline his son , so the   Lord , your God , discipline you .        therefore , keep the commandment of the   Lord , your God , by walk in his way and fear he .    caution about Prosperity .      for the   Lord , your God , be bring you into a good country , a land with stream of water , with spring and fountain well up in the hill and valley ,      a land of wheat and barley , of vine and fig tree and pomegranate , of olive tree and of honey ,      a land where you will always have bread and where you will lack nothing , a land whose stone contain iron and in whose hill you can mine copper .      but when you have eat and be satisfied , you must bless the   Lord , your God , for the good land he have give you .       be careful not to forget the   Lord , your God , by fail to keep his commandment and ordinance and statute which I enjoin on you today :      lest , when you have eat and be satisfied , and have build fine house and live in they ,      and your herd and flock have increase , your silver and gold have increase , and all your property have increase ,      you then become haughty of heart and forget the   Lord , your God , who bring you out of the land of Egypt , that house of slavery ;      he guide you through the vast and terrible wilderness with its saraph    serpent and scorpion , its parched and waterless ground ; he bring forth water for you from the flinty rock        and feed you in the wilderness with manna , a food unknown to your ancestor , that he might afflict you and test you , but also make you prosperous in the end .      otherwise , you might say in your heart ,    it be my own power and the strength of my own hand that have get I this wealth .      remember then the   Lord , your God , for he be the one who give you the power to get wealth , by fulfil , as he have now do , the covenant he swear to your ancestor .      but if you do forget the   Lord , your God , and go after other god , serve and bow down to they ,    I bear witness to you this day that you will perish utterly .      like the nation which the   Lord   destroy before you , so shall you too perish for not listen to the voice of the   Lord , your God .
