b '    call now ! will anyone respond to you ?   to which of the holy one    will you turn ?   surely impatience kill the fool   and indignation slay the simpleton .   I have see a fool spread his root ,    but I curse his household suddenly :   may his child be far from safety ;   may they be crush at the gate    without a rescuer .   what they have reap may the hungry eat up ,   or God take away by blight ,   or the thirsty swallow their substance .   for not from dust do mischief come ,   nor from the soil do trouble sprout .   human being beget mischief   as spark    fly upward .   in your place , I would appeal to God ,   and to God I would state my plea .    he do thing great and unsearchable ,   thing marvelous and innumerable .   he give rain upon the earth   and send water upon the field ;    he set up the lowly on high ,   and those who mourn be raise to safety .   he frustrate the plan of the cunning ,   so that their hand achieve no success ;   he catch the wise in their own ruse ,    and the design of the crafty be route .   they meet with darkness in the daytime ,   at noonday they grope as though it be night .   but he save the poor from the sword of their mouth ,    from the hand of the mighty .   thus the needy have hope ,   and iniquity close its mouth .   happy the one whom God reprove !   the Almightys    discipline do not reject .   for he wound , but he bind up ;    he strike , but his hand give healing .   out of six trouble he will deliver you ,   and at the seventh    no evil shall touch you .   in famine he will deliver you from death ,   and in war from the power of the sword ;   from the scourge of the tongue you shall be hide ,   and you shall not fear approach ruin .   at ruin and want you shall laugh ;   the beast of the earth , do not fear .   with the stone of the field shall your covenant be ,   and the wild beast shall be at peace with you .   and you shall know that your tent be secure ;   take stock of your household , you shall miss nothing .   you shall know that your descendant be many ,   and your offspring like the grass of the earth .   you shall approach the grave in full vigor ,   as a shock of grain come in at its season .   see , this we have search out ; so it be !   this we have hear , and you should know .
