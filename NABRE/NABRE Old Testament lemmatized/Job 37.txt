b '    at this my heart tremble   and leaps out of its place .   listen to his angry voice    and the rumble that come forth from his mouth !   everywhere under the heaven he send it ,   with his light , to the end of the earth .   again his voice roar ,   his majestic voice thunder ;   he do not restrain they when his voice be hear .   God thunder forth marvel with his voice ;   he do great thing beyond our knowing .   he say to the snow , fall to the earth ;   likewise to his heavy , drench rain .   he shut up all humankind indoor ,   so that all people may know his work .   the wild beast take to cover   and remain quiet in their dens .   out of its chamber the tempest come forth ;   from the north wind , the cold .   with his breath God bring the frost ,   and the broad water congeal .    the cloud too be laden with moisture ,   the storm - cloud scatter its light .    he it be who change their round , accord to his plan ,   to do all that he command they   across the inhabited world .   whether for punishment or mercy ,   he make it happen .   listen to this , Job !   stand and consider the marvel of God !   do you know how God lay his command upon they ,   and make the light shine forth from his cloud ?   do you know how the cloud be bank ,   the marvel of he who be perfect in knowledge ?   you , who swelter in your clothe   when calm lie over the land from the south ,   can you with he spread out the firmament of the sky ,   hard as a molten mirror ?    teach we then what we shall say to he ;   we can not , for the darkness , make our plea .   will he be tell about it when I speak ?   can anyone talk when he be be destroy ?   rather , it be as the light that can not be see   while it be obscure by the cloud ,   till the wind come by and sweep they away .    from Zaphon    the golden splendor come ,   surround Gods awesome majesty !   the Almighty ! we can not find he ,   preeminent in power and judgment ,   abundant in justice , who never oppress .   therefore people fear he ;   none can see he , however wise their heart .
