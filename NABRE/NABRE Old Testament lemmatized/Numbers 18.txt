b '    the   Lord   say to Aaron :    you and your son as well as your ancestral house with you    shall be responsible for any sin with respect to the sanctuary ; but only you and your son with you shall be responsible for any sin with respect to your priesthood .      you shall also present with you your kinsman of the tribe of Levi , your ancestral tribe , that they may be join to you    and assist you , while you and your son with you be in front of the tent of the covenant .      they shall discharge your obligation and those with respect to the whole tent ; however , they shall not come near the utensil of the sanctuary or the altar , or else both they and you will die .      they will be join to you to perform the duty associate with the tent of meeting , all the labor pertain to the tent . but no unauthorized person    shall come near you .      you shall perform the duty of the sanctuary and of the altar , that wrath may not fall again upon the Israelites .     I hereby take your kinsman , the Levites , from among the Israelites ; they be a gift to you ,    dedicate to the   Lord   for the labor they perform for the tent of meeting .       but you and your son with you must take care to exercise your priesthood in whatever concern the altar and the area within the veil .    I give you your priesthood as a gift . any unauthorized person who come near shall be put to death .    the Priests share of the sacrifice .     the   Lord   say to Aaron :    I hereby give to you charge of the contribution make to I , include the various holy offering of the Israelites ;    I assign they to you and to your son as a perquisite , a perpetual due .      this be what you shall have from the oblation that be most holy : every offering of theirs\xe2\x80\x94namely , all their grain offering , purification offering , and reparation offering which they must return to me\xe2\x80\x94shall be most holy for you and for your son .      you shall eat they in a most holy place ;    every male may partake of they . as holy , they belong to you .     this also you shall have : the contribution that be their gift , include the elevated offering    of the Israelites ; I assign they to you and to your son and daughter with you as a perpetual due .    all in your household who be clean may eat they .      I also assign to you all the good    of the new oil and of the new wine and grain that they give to the   Lord   as their first produce that have be process .      the first - ripen fruit of whatever be in their land , which they bring to the   Lord , shall be yours ; all of your household who be clean may eat they .      whatever be under the ban    in Israel shall be yours .      every live thing that open the womb , human being and beast alike , such as be to be offer to the   Lord , shall be yours ;    but you must redeem the firstborn of human being , as well as redeem the firstborn of unclean animal .      for the redemption price of a son , when he be a month old , you shall pay the equivalent of five silver shekel accord to the sanctuary shekel , that is , twenty gerah .      but the firstborn of cattle , or the firstborn of sheep or the firstborn of goat you shall not redeem ; they be holy . their blood you must splash on the altar and their fat you must burn as an oblation of pleasing aroma to the   Lord .       their meat , however , shall be yours , just as the brisket of the elevated offering and the right thigh belong to you .      as a perpetual due I assign to you and to your son and daughter with you all the contribution of holy thing which the Israelites set aside for the   Lord ; this be a covenant of salt    to last forever before the   Lord , for you and for your descendant with you .       then the   Lord   say to Aaron :    you shall not have any heritage in their land nor hold any portion among they ; I will be your portion and your heritage among the Israelites .    tithe due the Levites .     to the Levites , however , I hereby assign all tithe in Israel as their heritage in recompense for the labor they perform , the labor pertain to the tent of meeting .        the Israelites may no long approach the tent of meeting , thereby incur the penalty of death .      only the Levites be to perform the labor pertain to the tent of meeting , and they shall incur the penalty for the Israelites sin ;    this be a permanent statute for all your generation . but they shall not have any heritage among the Israelites ,      for I have assign to the Levites as their heritage the tithe which the Israelites put aside as a contribution to the   Lord . that be why I have say , they will not have any heritage among the Israelites .    Tithes Paid by the Levites .     the   Lord   say to Moses :      speak to the Levites and say to they : when you take from the Israelites the tithe I have assign you from they as your heritage , you be to make a contribution from they to the   Lord , a tithe of the tithe ;      and your contribution will be credit to you as if it be grain from the threshing floor or new wine from the vat .      thus you too shall make a contribution to the   Lord   from all the tithe you take from the Israelites , hand over to Aaron the priest the contribution to the   Lord .      from all the gift to you , you shall make every contribution due to the   Lord \xe2\x80\x94from their good part , that be the part to be consecrate from they .     say to they also : once you have make your contribution from the good part , the rest of the tithe will be credit to the Levites as if it be produce of the threshing floor or the produce of the vat .      you and your household may eat it anywhere , since it be your recompense in exchange for labor in the tent of meeting .      you will incur no punishment when you contribute the good part of it . but do not profane the holy offering of the Israelites or else you shall die .
