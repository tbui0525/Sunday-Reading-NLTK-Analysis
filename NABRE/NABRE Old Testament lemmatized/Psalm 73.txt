b '   the Trial of the just   a psalm of Asaph . how good God be to the upright ,   to those who be pure of heart !    I   but , as for I , my foot have almost stumble ;   my step have nearly slip ,   because I be envious of the arrogant   when I see the prosperity of the wicked .    for they suffer no pain ;   their body be healthy and sleek .   they be free of the burden of life ;   they be not afflict like other .   thus pride adorn they as a necklace ;   violence clothe they as a robe .   out of such blindness come sin ;   evil thought flood their heart .    they scoff and spout their malice ;   from on high they utter threat .     they set their mouth against the heavens ,   their tongue roam the earth .    so my people turn to they   and drink deeply of their word .   they say , do God really know ?   do the most high have any knowledge ?    such , then , be the wicked ,   always carefree , increase their wealth .    II   be it in vain that I have keep my heart pure ,   wash my hand in innocence ?    for I be afflict day after day ,   chastise every morning .   have I think , I will speak as they do ,   I would have betray this generation of your child .   though I try to understand all this ,   it be too difficult for I ,   till I enter the sanctuary of God   and come to understand their end .     III   you set they , indeed , on a slippery road ;   you hurl they down to ruin .   how suddenly they be devastate ;   utterly undo by disaster !   they be like a dream after wake , Lord ,   dismiss like shadow when you arise .     IV   since my heart be embitter   and my soul deeply wound ,   I be stupid and could not understand ;   I be like a brute beast in your presence .   yet I be always with you ;   you take hold of my right hand .    with your counsel you guide I ,   and at the end receive I with honor .    whom else have I in the heaven ?   none beside you delight I on earth .   though my flesh and my heart fail ,   God be the rock of my heart , my portion forever .   but those who be far from you perish ;   you destroy those unfaithful to you .   as for I , to be near God be my good ,   to make the Lord   God   my refuge . I shall declare all your work   in the gate of daughter Zion .              '
