b '   Joshuas Final Plea .     many year later , after the   Lord   have give the Israelites rest from all their enemy round about they , and when Joshua be old and advanced in year ,        he summon all Israel , include their elder , leader , judge , and officer , and say to they : I be old and advanced in year .        you have see all that the   Lord , your God , have do for you against all these nation ; for it have be the   Lord , your God , who fight for you .       see , I have apportion among your tribe as their heritage the nation that survive , as well as those I destroy , between the Jordan and the Great Sea in the west .      the   Lord , your God , will drive they out and dispossess they at your approach , so that you will take possession of their land as the   Lord , your God , promise you .      therefore be strong and be careful to observe all that be write in the book of the law of Moses , never turn from it right or left ,        or mingle with these nation that survive among you . you must not invoke their god by name , or swear by they , or serve they , or bow down to they ,        but you must hold fast to the   Lord , your God , as you have do up to this day .      at your approach the   Lord   have dispossess great and strong nation ; not one have withstand you up to this day .      one of you put to flight a thousand , because it be the   Lord , your God , himself who fight for you ,    as he promise you .      as for you , take great care to love the   Lord , your God .      for if you ever turn away from he and join with the remnant of these nation that survive among you , by intermarry and intermingle with they ,        know for certain that the   Lord , your God , will no long dispossess these nation at your approach . instead they will be a snare and a trap for you , a scourge for your side and thorn for your eye , until you perish from this good land which the   Lord , your God , have give you .      today , as you see , I be go the way of all the earth .    so now acknowledge with your whole heart and soul that not one of all the promise the   Lord , your God , make concern you have fail . every one have come true for you ; not one have fail .       but just as every promise the   Lord , your God , make to you have come true for you , so will he bring upon you every threat ,    even so far as to exterminate you from this good land which the   Lord , your God , have give you .      if you transgress the covenant of the   Lord , your God , which he enjoin on you , to go and serve other god and bow down to they , the anger of the   Lord   will flare up against you and you will quickly perish from the good land he have give you .
