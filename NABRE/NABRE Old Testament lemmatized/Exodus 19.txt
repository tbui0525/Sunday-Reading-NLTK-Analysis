b '    Arrival at Sinai .      in the third month after the Israelites departure from the land of Egypt , on the first day , they come to the wilderness of Sinai .      after they make the journey from Rephidim and enter the wilderness of Sinai , they then pitch camp in the wilderness .   while Israel be encamp there in front of the mountain ,      Moses go up to the mountain of God . then the   Lord   call to he from the mountain , say : this be what you will say to the house of Jacob ; tell the Israelites :      you have see how I treat the Egyptians and how I bear you up on eagle wing and bring you to myself .        now , if you obey I completely and keep my covenant ,    you will be my treasured possession among all people ,    though all the earth be mine .      you will be to I a kingdom of priest ,    a holy nation .    that be what you must tell the Israelites .      so Moses go and summon the elder of the people . when he set before they all that the   Lord   have order he to tell they ,      all the people answer together , everything the   Lord   have say , we will do . then Moses bring back to the   Lord   the response of the people .     the   Lord   say to Moses : I be come to you now in a dense cloud ,    so that when the people hear I speak with you , they will also remain faithful to you . when Moses , then , have report the response of the people to the   Lord ,      the   Lord   say to Moses : go to the people and have they sanctify themselves today and tomorrow . have they wash their garment      and be ready for the third day ; for on the third day the   Lord   will come down on Mount Sinai in the sight of all the people .      set limit for the people all around ,    say : take care not to go up the mountain , or even to touch its edge . all who touch the mountain must be put to death .      no hand shall touch they , but they must be stone to death or kill with arrow . whether human being or beast , they must not be allow to live . only when the ram horn sound may they go up on the mountain .        then Moses come down from the mountain to the people and have they sanctify themselves , and they wash their garment .      he say to the people , be ready for the third day . do not approach a woman .    the Great Theophany .      on the morning of the third day there be peal of thunder and lightning , and a heavy cloud over the mountain , and a very loud blast of the shofar ,    so that all the people in the camp tremble .      but Moses lead the people out of the camp to meet God , and they station themselves at the foot of the mountain .      now Mount Sinai be completely envelop in smoke , because the   Lord   have come down upon it in fire . the smoke rise from it as though from a kiln , and the whole mountain tremble violently .      the blast of the shofar grow louder and louder , while Moses be speak and God be answer he with thunder .      when the   Lord   come down upon Mount Sinai , to the top of the mountain , the   Lord   summon Moses to the top of the mountain , and Moses go up .      then the   Lord   tell Moses : go down and warn the people not to break through to the   Lord   in order to see he ; otherwise many of they will be strike down .      for their part , the priest , who approach the   Lord   must sanctify themselves ; else the   Lord   will break out in anger against they .      but Moses say to the   Lord , the people can not go up to Mount Sinai , for you yourself warn we , say : set limit around the mountain to make it sacred .      so the   Lord   say to he : go down and come up along with Aaron . but do not let the priest and the people break through to come up to the   Lord ; else he will break out against they .      so Moses go down to the people and speak to they .
