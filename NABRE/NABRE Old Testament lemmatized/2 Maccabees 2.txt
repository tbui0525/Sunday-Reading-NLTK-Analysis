b '    in the record it will be find that Jeremiah the prophet order the deportee to take some of the fire with they as indicate ,      and that the prophet , in give they the law , direct the deportee not to forget the commandment of the Lord or be lead astray in their thought , when see the gold and silver idol and their adornment .        with other similar word he exhort they that the law should not depart from their heart .      the same document also tell how the prophet , in virtue of an oracle , order that the tent and the ark should accompany he , and how he go to the very mountain that Moses climb to behold Gods inheritance .        when Jeremiah arrive there , he find a chamber in a cave in which he put the tent , the ark , and the altar of incense ; then he seal the entrance .      some of those who follow he come up intend to mark the path , but they could not find it .      when Jeremiah hear of this , he reprove they : the place be to remain unknown until God gather his people together again and show they mercy .      then the Lord will disclose these thing , and the glory of the Lord and the cloud will be see , just as they appear in the time of Moses and of Solomon when he pray that the place    might be greatly sanctify .      it be also relate how Solomon in his wisdom offer a sacrifice for the dedication and the completion of the temple .      just as Moses pray to the Lord and fire descend from the sky and consume the sacrifice , so also Solomon pray and fire come down and consume the burn offering .         Moses have say , because it have not be eat , the purification offering be consume .        Solomon also celebrate the feast in the same way for eight day .     these same thing be also tell in the record and in Nehemiahs memoir ,    as well as how he found a library and collect the book about the king and the prophet , the book of David , and the royal letter about votive offering .      in like manner Judas also collect for we all the book that have be scatter because of the war , and we now have they in our possession .        if you need they , send messenger to get they for you .     as we be about to celebrate the purification , we be write : you should celebrate the feast day .      it be God who have save all his people and have restore to all of they their inheritance , the kingdom , the priesthood , and the sacred rite ,      as he promise through the law . for we hope in God , that he will soon have mercy on we and gather we together from everywhere under the heaven to his holy place , for he have rescue we from great peril and have purify the place .     II . Compilers Preface   this be the story of Judas Maccabeus and his brother , of the purification of the great temple , the dedication of the altar ,      the campaign against Antiochus Epiphanes and his son Eupator ,        and of the heavenly manifestation accord to the hero who fight bravely for the jewish people . few as they be , they plunder the whole land , put to flight the barbarian horde ,      regain possession of the temple renowne throughout the world , and liberate the city . they re - establish the law that be in danger of be abolish , while the Lord favor they with every kindness .      all this , detail by Jason of Cyrene in five volume , we will try to condense into a single book .     for in view of the flood of datum , and the difficulty encounter , give such abundant material , by those who wish to plunge into account of the history ,      we have aim to please those who prefer simply to read , to make it easy for the studious who wish to commit thing to memory , and to be helpful to all .      for we who have undertake the labor of make this digest , the task , far from be easy , be one of sweat and of sleepless night .      just so , the preparation of a festive banquet be no light matter for one who seek to give enjoyment to other . similarly , to win the gratitude of many we will gladly endure this labor ,      leave the responsibility for exact detail to the historian , and confine our effort to present only a summary outline .      as the architect of a new house must pay attention to the whole structure , while the one who undertake the decoration and the fresco have to be concern only with what be need for ornamentation , so I think it be with we .        to enter into question and examine they from all side and to be busy about detail be the task of the historian ;      but one who be make an adaptation should be allow to aim at brevity of expression and to forgo complete treatment of the matter .      here , then , let we begin our account without add to what have already be say ; it would be silly to lengthen the preface to the history and then cut short the history itself .
