b ' prayer against evil tongue   for the leader ; upon the eighth . a psalm of David .    I   help ,   Lord , for no one loyal remain ;   the faithful have vanish from the child of man .    they tell lie to one another ,   speak with deceive lip and a double heart .     II   may the   Lord   cut off all deceive lip ,   and every boastful tongue ,   those who say , by our tongue we prevail ;   when our lip speak , who can lord it over we ?     III   because they rob the weak , and the needy groan ,   I will now arise , say the   Lord ;   I will grant safety to whoever long for it .     IV   the promise of the   Lord   be sure ,   silver refine in a crucible ,    silver purify seven time .    you , o   Lord , protect we always ;   preserve we from this generation .   on every side the wicked roam ;   the shameless be extoll by the child of man .
