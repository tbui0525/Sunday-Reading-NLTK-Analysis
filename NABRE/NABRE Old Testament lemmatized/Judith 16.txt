b '   Judiths Hymn of Deliverance   and Judith sing : strike up a song to my God with tambourine ,    sing to the Lord with cymbal ; improvise for he a new song ,   exalt and acclaim his name .   for the Lord be a God who crush war ;    he set his encampment among his people ;   he deliver I from the hand of my pursuer .     the Assyrian come from the mountain of the north ,   with myriad of his force he come ; their number block the wadie ,   their cavalry cover the hill .   he threaten to burn my territory ,   put my youth to the sword , dash my infant to the ground ,   seize my child as plunder .   and carry off my virgin as spoil .     but the Lord Almighty thwart they ,   by the hand of a female !   not by youth be their champion strike down ,    nor do Titans bring he low ,   nor do tall giant attack he ;   but Judith , the daughter of Merari ,   by the beauty of her face bring he down .   she take off her widow garb   to raise up the afflict in Israel . she anoint her face with fragrant oil ;    fix her hair with a diadem ,   and put on a linen robe to beguile he .   her sandal ravish his eye ,    her beauty captivate his mind ,   the sword cut through his neck !      the Persians tremble at her boldness ,   the Medes be daunt at her daring .   when my lowly one shout ,   and my weak one cry out , the enemy be terrify ,   scream and take to flight .   son of maidservant pierce they through ;   wound they like deserter child .   they perish before the rank of my Lord .     I will sing a new song to my God .    o Lord , great be you and glorious ,   marvelous in power and unsurpassable .   let your every creature serve you ;   for you speak , and they be make . you send forth your spirit , and it create they ;    no one can resist your voice .    for the mountain to their basis   be toss with the water ;   the rock , like wax , melt before your glance .     but to those who fear you ,   you will show mercy .   though the sweet fragrance of every sacrifice be a trifle ,   and the fat of all burn offering but little in your sight ,   one who fear the Lord be forever great .     Woe to the nation that rise against my people !   the Lord Almighty will requite they ;   in the day of judgment he will punish they : he will send fire and worm into their flesh ,    and they will weep and suffer forever .     when they arrive at Jerusalem , they worship God . as soon as the people be purify , they offer their burn offering , voluntary offering , and donation .        Judith dedicate to God all the thing of Holofernes that the people have give she , put under the ban the canopy that she herself have take from his bedchamber .        for three month the people continue their celebration in Jerusalem before the sanctuary , and Judith remain with they .    the Renown and death of Judith .     when those day be over , all of they return to their inheritance . Judith go back to Bethulia and remain on her estate . for the rest of her life she be renowned throughout the land .      many wish to marry she , but she give herself to no man all the day of her life from the time her husband , Manasseh , die and be gather to his people .      her fame continue to increase , and she live in the house of her husband , reach the advanced age of one hundred and five .     she set her maid free . and when she die in Bethulia , they bury she in the cave of her husband , Manasseh ;        and the house of Israel mourn she for seven day .     before she die , she distribute her property to the relative of her husband , Manasseh , and to her own relative .       during the lifetime of Judith and for a long time after her death , no one ever again spread terror    among the Israelites .
