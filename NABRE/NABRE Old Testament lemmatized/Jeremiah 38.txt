Shephatiah , son of Mattan , Gedaliah , son of Pashhur , Jucal , son of Shelemiah , and Pashhur , son of Malchiah , hear the word Jeremiah be speak to all the people :        thus say the   Lord : those who remain in this city shall die by mean of the sword , starvation , and disease ; but those who go out to the Chaldeans shall live . their life shall be spare they as spoil of war that they may live .        thus say the   Lord : this city shall certainly be hand over to the army of the king of Babylon ; he shall capture it .     then the prince say to the king , this man ought to be put to death . he be weaken the resolve    of the soldier leave in this city and of all the people , by say such thing to they ; he be not seek the welfare of our people , but their ruin .        King Zedekiah answer : he be in your hand , for the king could do nothing with they .      and so they take Jeremiah and throw he into the cistern of Prince Malchiah , in the court of the guard , let he down by rope . there be no water in the cistern , only mud , and Jeremiah sink down into the mud .      now ebed - melech , an Ethiopian , a court official in the king house , hear that they have put Jeremiah in the cistern . the king happen to be sit at the Gate of Benjamin ,      and Ebed - melech go there from the house of the king and say to he ,      my lord king , these man have do wrong in all their treatment of Jeremiah the prophet , throw he into the cistern . he will starve to death on the spot , for there be no more bread in the city .        then the king order Ebed - melech the Ethiopian : take three man with you , and get Jeremiah the prophet out of the cistern before he die .      ebe - melech take the man with he , and go first to the linen closet in the house of the king . he take some old , tattered rag and lower they by rope to Jeremiah in the cistern .      then he say to Jeremiah , put these old , tattered rag between your armpit and the rope . Jeremiah do so ,      and they pull he up by rope out of the cistern . but Jeremiah remain in the court of the guard .     King Zedekiah summon Jeremiah the prophet to meet he at the third entrance of the house of the   Lord . I have a question to ask you , the king say to Jeremiah . do not hide anything from I .        Jeremiah answer Zedekiah : if I tell you anything , will you not have I put to death ? if I counsel you , you will not listen to I !        but King Zedekiah swear to Jeremiah secretly : as the   Lord   live who give we our life , I will not kill you , nor will I hand you over to those man who seek your life .     Jeremiah then say to Zedekiah : thus say the   Lord   God of host , the God of Israel : if you will only surrender to the prince of Babylons king , you shall save your life ; this city shall not be destroy by fire , and you and your household shall live .        but if you do not surrender to the prince of Babylons king , this city shall fall into the hand of the Chaldeans , who shall destroy it by fire , and you shall not escape their hand .      King Zedekiah say to Jeremiah , I be afraid of the Judahites who have desert to the Chaldeans ; I could be hand over to they , and they will mistreat I .        you will not be hand over to they , Jeremiah answer . I beg you ! please listen to the voice of the   Lord   regard what I tell you so that it may go well with you and your life be spare .        but if you refuse to surrender , this be what the   Lord   have show :      I see all the woman who remain in the house of Judahs king be bring out to the prince of Babylons king , and they be cry : they betray you , outdo you ,   your good friend ! now that your foot be sink in mud ,   they slink away .      all your wife and child shall be bring out to the Chaldeans , and you shall not escape their hand ; you shall be hand over to the king of Babylon , and this city shall be destroy by fire .      then Zedekiah say to Jeremiah , let no one know about this conversation , or you shall die .      if the prince should hear I speak with you and if they should come and ask you , tell we what you say to the king ; do not hide it from we , or we will kill you , or , what do the king say to you ?      then give they this answer : I petition the king not to send I back to Jonathans house lest I die there .      when all the prince come to Jeremiah and question he , he answer they with the very word the king have command . they say no more to he , for nothing have be overhear of the conversation .      thus Jeremiah stay in the court of the guard until the day Jerusalem be take .
