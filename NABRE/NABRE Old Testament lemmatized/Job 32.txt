b ' vii . Elihus Speeches    then the three man cease to answer Job , because in his own eye he be in the right .         but the anger of Elihu ,    son of Barachel the Buzite , of the clan of Ram , be kindle . he be angry with Job for consider himself rather than God to be in the right .       he be angry also with the three friend because they have not find a good answer and have not condemn Job .      but since these man be old than he , Elihu bide his time before address Job .      when , however , Elihu see that there be no reply in the mouth of the three man , his wrath be inflame .      so Elihu , son of Barachel the Buzite , answer and say : I be young and you be very old ;   therefore I hold back and be afraid   to declare to you my knowledge .   I think , day should speak ,   and many year teach wisdom !    but there be a spirit in human being ,    the breath of the Almighty , that give they understanding .   it be not those of many day who be wise ,   nor the aged who understand the right .   therefore I say , listen to I ;   I also will declare my knowledge !   behold , I have wait for your word ,   have give ear to your argument ,   as you search out what to say .   yes , I follow you attentively :   and look , none of you have convict Job ,   not one could refute his statement .   so do not say , we have meet wisdom ;    God can vanquish he but no mortal !   for have he address his word to I ,   I would not then have answer he with your word .   they be dismayed , they make no more reply ;   word fail they .   must I wait ? now that they speak no more ,   and have cease to make reply ,   I too will speak my part ;   I also will declare my knowledge !   for I be full of word ;   the spirit within I compel I .   my belly be like unopened wine ,   like wineskin ready to burst .   let I speak and obtain relief ;   let I open my lip , and reply .   I would not be partial to anyone ,   nor give flattering title to any .   for I know nothing of flattery ;   if I do , my maker would soon take I away .             '
