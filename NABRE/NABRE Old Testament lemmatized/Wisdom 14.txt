b '    again , one prepare for a voyage and about to traverse the wild wave   cry out to wood more unsound than the boat that bear he .    for the urge for profit devise this latter ,   and Wisdom the artisan produce it .      but your providence , o Father ! guide it ,   for you have furnish even in the sea a road ,   and through the wave a steady path ,    show that you can save from any danger ,   so that even one without skill may embark .    but you will that the product of your wisdom be not idle ;   therefore people trust their life even to most frail wood ,   and be safe cross the wave on a raft .    for of old , when the proud giant be be destroy ,   the hope of the universe , who take refuge on a raft ,    leave to the world a future for the human family , under the guidance of your hand .     for bl be the wood through which righteousness come about ;    but the handmade idol be accursed , and its maker as well :   he for having produce it , and the corruptible thing , because it be term a god .    equally odious to God be the evildoer and the evil deed ;    and the thing make will be punish with its maker .   therefore upon even the idol of the nation shall a judgment come ,   since they become abominable among Gods work , snare for human soul   and a trap for the foot of the senseless .     the Origin and Evils of Idolatry   for the source of wantonness be the devising of idol ;   and their invention , a corruption of life .    for in the beginning they be not ,   nor can they ever continue ;     for from human emptiness they come into the world ,   and therefore a sudden end be devise for they .      for a father , afflict with untimely mourning ,   make an image of the child so quickly take from he , and now honor as a god what once be dead   and hand down to his household mystery and sacrifice .   then , in the course of time , the impious practice gain strength and be observe as law ,   and graven thing be worship by royal decree .    People who live so far away that they could not honor he in his presence   copy the appearance of the distant king and make a public image of he they wish to honor ,   out of zeal to flatter the absent one as though present .   and to promote this observance among those to whom it be strange ,   the artisan ambition provide a stimulus .   for he , perhaps in his determination to please the ruler ,   labor over the likeness    to the good of his skill ;    and the masse , draw by the charm of the workmanship ,   soon take as an object of worship the one who shortly before be honor as a human being .    and this become a snare for the world ,   that people enslave to either grief or tyranny   confer the incommunicable name on stone and wood .     then it be not enough for they to err in their knowledge of God ;    but even though they live in a great war result from ignorance ,   they call such evil peace .    for while they practice either child sacrifice or occult mystery ,   or frenzied carousing in exotic rite ,    they no long respect either life or purity of marriage ;   but they either waylay and kill each other , or aggrieve each other by adultery .   and all be confusion\xe2\x80\x94blood and murder , theft and guile ,    corruption , faithlessness , turmoil , perjury ,   disturbance of good people , neglect of gratitude ,   besmirching of soul , unnatural lust ,   disorder in marriage , adultery and shamelessness .   for the worship of infamous idol   be the reason and source and extreme of all evil .      for they either go mad with enjoyment , or prophesy lie ,   or live lawlessly or lightly perjure themselves .    for as their trust be in lifeless idol ,   they expect no harm when they have swear falsely .   but on both count justice shall overtake they :   because they think perversely of God by devote themselves to idol ,    and because they deliberately swear false oath , despise piety .    for it be not the might of those by whom they swear ,   but the just retribution of sinner ,   that ever follow upon the transgression of the wicked .
