b '   I will give myself up to complaint ;   I will speak from the bitterness of my soul .   I will say to God : do not put I in the wrong !   let I know why you oppose I .    be it a pleasure for you to oppress ,   to spurn the work of your hand ,   and shine on the plan of the wicked ?   have you eye of flesh ?   do you see as mortal see ?   be your day like the day of a mortal ,    and be your year like a human lifetime ,   that you seek for guilt in I   and search after my sin ,   even though you know that I be not wicked ,    and that none can deliver I out of your hand ?   your hand have form I and fashion I ;   will you then turn and destroy I ?   oh , remember that you fashion I from clay !    will you then bring I down to dust again ?   do you not pour I out like milk ,   and thicken I like cheese ?   with skin and flesh you clothe I ,   with bone and sinew knit I together .   Life and love you grant I ,   and your providence have preserve my spirit .   yet these thing you have hide in your heart ;   I know they be your purpose :   if I should sin , you would keep a watch on I ,   and from my guilt you would not absolve I .   if I should be wicked , alas for I !   even if righteous , I dare not hold up my head ,   sate with shame , drench in affliction !   should it lift up , you hunt I like a lion :   repeatedly you show your wondrous power against I ,   you renew your attack    upon I   and multiply your harassment of I ;   in wave your troop come against I .   why then do you bring I forth from the womb ?    I should have die and no eye have see I .   I should be as though I have never live ;   I should have be take from the womb to the grave .   be not my day few ? stop !   let I alone , that I may recover a little   before I go whence I shall not return ,    to the land of darkness and of gloom ,   the dark , disorder land   where darkness be the only light .
