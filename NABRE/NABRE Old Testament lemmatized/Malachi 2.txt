b '    and now , priest , this commandment be for you :   if you do not listen ,    and if you do not take to heart   give honor to my name , say the   Lord   of host , I will send a curse upon you   and your blessing I will curse . in fact , I have already curse it ,   because you do not take it to heart .   I will rebuke your offspring ;   I will spread dung on your face , Dung from your feast ,   and will carry you to it .   you should know that I send you this commandment   so that my covenant with Levi might endure ,   say the   Lord   of host .    my covenant with he be the life and peace which I give he ,   and the fear he have for I ,   stand in awe of my name .    reliable instruction be in his mouth ,   no perversity be find upon his lip ; he walk with I in integrity and uprightness ,   and turn many away from evil .    for a priest lip preserve knowledge ,   and instruction be to be seek from his mouth ,   because he be the messenger of the   Lord   of host .   but you have turn aside from the way ,   and have cause many to stumble by your instruction ; you have corrupt the covenant of Levi ,    say the   Lord   of host .   I , therefore , have make you contemptible   and base before all the people , for you do not keep my way ,   but show partiality in your instruction .    marriage and Divorce     have we not all one father ?   have not one God create we ? why , then , do we break faith with each other ,   profane the covenant of our ancestor ?    Judah have break faith ; an abominable thing   have be do in Israel and in Jerusalem . Judah have profane the   Lord s holy place , which he love ,   and have marry a daughter of a foreign god .    may the   Lord   cut off from the man who do this   both witness and advocate from the tent of Jacob ,   and anyone to bring an offering to the   Lord   of host !   this also you do : the altar of the   Lord   you cover   with tear , weeping , and groaning , because the Lord no long take note of your offering   or accept it favorably from your hand .    and you say , Why?\xe2\x80\x94   because the   Lord   be witness   between you and the wife of your youth with whom you have break faith ,   though she be your companion , your covenanted wife .     do he not make they one , with flesh and spirit ?   and what do the one require ? godly offspring ! you should be on guard , then , for your life ,   and do not break faith with the wife of your youth .   for I hate divorce ,   say the   Lord , the God of Israel , and the one who cover his garment with violence ,   say the   Lord   of host . you should be on guard , then , for your life ,   and you must not break faith .    purification and just judgment   you have weary the   Lord   with your word ,   yet you say , how have we weary he ? by say , all evildoer   be good in the sight of the   Lord , and he be pleased with they ,   or where be the just God ?
