b '     this be what Isaiah , son of Amoz , see concern Judah and Jerusalem .    Zion , the Royal City of God     in day to come , the mountain of the   Lord s house   shall be establish as the high mountain   and raise above the hill . all nation shall stream toward it .     many people shall come and say : come , let we go up to the   Lord s mountain ,   to the house of the God of Jacob , that he may instruct we in his way ,   and we may walk in his path .   for from Zion shall go forth instruction ,   and the word of the   Lord   from Jerusalem .    he shall judge between the nation ,   and set term for many people . they shall beat their sword into plowshare   and their spear into pruning hook ;   one nation shall not raise the sword against another ,   nor shall they train for war again .     House of Jacob , come ,   let we walk in the light of the   Lord !    the Lords Day of judgment on Pride   you have abandon your people ,   the house of Jacob ! because they be fill with diviner ,   and soothsayer , like the Philistines ;   with foreigner they clasp hand .    their land be full of silver and gold ,   there be no end to their treasure ; their land be full of horse ,   there be no end to their chariot .   their land be full of idol ;   they bow down to the work of their hand ,   what their finger have make .    so all shall be abase ,   each one bring low .    do not pardon they !   get behind the rock ,   hide in the dust , from the terror of the   Lord   and the splendor of his majesty !   the eye of human pride shall be lower ,   the arrogance of mortal shall be abase ,   and the   Lord   alone will be exalt , on that day .    for the   Lord   of host will have his day   against all that be proud and arrogant ,   against all that be high , and it will be bring low ;   yes , against all the cedar of Lebanon    and against all the oak of Bashan ,   against all the lofty mountain   and all the high hill ,   against every lofty tower   and every fortified wall ,   against all the ship of Tarshish   and all stately vessel .   then human pride shall be abase ,   the arrogance of mortal bring low , and the   Lord   alone will be exalt on that day .    the idol will vanish completely .   People will go into cave in the rock   and into hole in the earth , at the terror of the   Lord   and the splendor of his majesty ,   as he rise to overawe the earth .   on that day people shall throw to mole and bat   their idol of silver and their idol of gold   which they make for themselves to worship .   and they shall go into cavern in the rock   and into crevice in the cliff , at the terror of the   Lord   and the splendor of his majesty ,   as he rise to overawe the earth .    as for you , stop worry about mortal ,   in whose nostril be but a breath ;   for of what worth be they ?
