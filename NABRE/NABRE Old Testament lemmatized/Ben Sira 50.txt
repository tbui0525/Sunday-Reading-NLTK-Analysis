b '   Simeon , Son of Jochanan   great of his family , the glory of his people ,   be   Simeon   the priest , son of Jochanan ,   in whose time the house of God be renovate ,   in whose day the temple be reinforce .   in his time also the retain wall be build   with powerful turret for the temple precinct .   in his time the reservoir be dig ,   a pool as vast as the sea .   he protect the people against brigand   and strengthen the city against the enemy .   how splendid he be as he look out from the tent ,   as he come from behind the veil !   like a star shine among the cloud ,   like the full moon at the festal season ;   like sun shine upon the temple of the King ,   like a rainbow appear in the cloudy sky ;   like blossom on the branch in springtime ,   like a lily by run water ; like a green shoot on Lebanon in summer ,    like the fire of incense at sacrifice ; like a vessel of hammer gold ,   stud with all kind of precious stone ;   like a luxuriant olive tree heavy with fruit ,   a plant with branch abound in oil ;   wear his glorious robe ,   and vest in sublime magnificence ,   as he ascend the glorious altar   and lend majesty to the court of the sanctuary .   when he receive the portion from the priest   while he stand before the sacrificial wood , his son stand round he like a garland ,   like young cedar on Lebanon ; and like poplar by the brook they surround he ,    all the son of Aaron in their glory , with the offering to the   Lord   in their hand ,   in the presence of the whole assembly of Israel .   once he have complete the service at the altar   and arrange the sacrificial hearth for the most high ,   and have stretch forth his hand for the cup ,   to offer blood of the grape , and pour it out at the foot of the altar ,   a sweet - smell odor to God the most high ,    then the son of Aaron would sound a blast ,   the priest , on their trumpet of beat metal ; a blast to resound mightily   as a reminder before the most high .    all the people with one accord   would fall with face to the ground in adoration before the most high ,   before the Holy One of Israel .     then hymn would re - echo ,   and over the throng sweet strain of praise resound .   all the people of the land would shout for joy ,   pray to the merciful one , as the high priest complete the service at the altar   by present to God the fitting sacrifice .   then come down he would raise his hand   over all the congregation of Israel ; the blessing of the   Lord   would be upon his lip ,   the name of the   Lord   would be his glory .    the people would again fall down   to receive the blessing of the most high .     and now , bless the God of all ,    who have do wonder on earth ; who foster growth from the womb ,   fashion it accord to his will !   may he grant you a wise heart   and abide with you in peace ;   may his goodness toward Simeon last forever ;   may he fulfill for he the covenant with Phinehas so that it may not be abrogate for he   or his descendant while the heavens last .
