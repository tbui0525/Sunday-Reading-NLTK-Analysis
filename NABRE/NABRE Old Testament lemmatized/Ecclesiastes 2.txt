b '   Study of pleasure - seeking .     I say in my heart ,    come , now , let I try you with pleasure and the enjoyment of good thing . see , this too be vanity .      of laughter I say : mad ! and of mirth : what good do this do ?      guide by wisdom ,    I probe with my mind how to beguile my sense with wine and take up folly , until I should understand what be good for human being to do under the heaven during the limited day of their life .     I undertake great work ; I build myself house and plant vineyard ;      I make garden and park , and in they set out fruit tree of all sort .      and I construct for myself reservoir to water a flourish woodland .      I acquire male and female slave , and have slave who be bear in my house . I also own vast herd of cattle and flock of sheep , more than all who have be before I in Jerusalem .      I amass for myself silver and gold , and the treasure of king and province . I provide for myself male and female singer and delight of man , many woman .        I accumulate much more than all other before I in Jerusalem ; my wisdom , too , stay with I .      nothing that my eye desire do I deny they , nor do I deprive myself of any joy ; rather , my heart rejoice in the fruit of all my toil . this be my share for all my toil .       but when I turn to all the work that my hand have work , and to the fruit of the toil for which I have toil so much , see ! all be vanity and a chase after wind . there be no profit under the sun .      what about one who succeed a king ? he can do only what have already be do .   Study of Wisdom and Folly .   I go on to the consideration of wisdom , madness and folly .      and I see that wisdom have as much profit over folly as light have over darkness .     Wise people have eye in their head ,   but fool walk in darkness . yet I know that the same lot befall both .         so I say in my heart , if the fool lot be to befall I also , why should I be wise ? where be the profit ? and in my heart I decide that this too be vanity .       the wise person will have no more abide remembrance than the fool ; for in day to come both will have be forget . how be it that the wise person die    like the fool !      therefore I detest life , since for I the work that be do under the sun be bad ; for all be vanity and a chase after wind .    Study of the fruit of Toil to other the Profits .     and I detest all the fruit of my toil under the sun , because I must leave they to the one who be to come after I .      and who know whether that one will be wise or a fool ? yet that one will take control of all the fruit of my toil and wisdom under the sun . this also be vanity .      so my heart turn to despair over all the fruit of my toil under the sun .      for here be one who have toil with wisdom and knowledge and skill , and that one legacy must be leave to another who have not toil for it . this also be vanity and a great evil .       for what profit come to mortal from all the toil and anxiety of heart with which they toil under the sun ?      every day sorrow and grief be their occupation ; even at night their heart be not at rest . this also be vanity .       there be nothing well for mortal than to eat and drink and provide themselves with good thing from their toil . even this , I see , be from the hand of God .      for who can eat or drink apart from God ?        for to the one who please God , he give wisdom and knowledge and joy ; but to the one who displease , God give the task of gather possession for the one who please God . this also be vanity and a chase after wind .
