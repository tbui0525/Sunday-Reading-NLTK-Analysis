b '   the Ram and the He - goat .      after this first vision , I , Daniel , have another , in the third year of the reign of King Belshazzar .      in my vision I see myself in the fortress of Susa    in the province of Elam ; I be beside the river Ulai .      I look up and see stand by the river a ram with two great horn , the one large and new than the other .      I see the ram butting toward the west , north , and south . no beast could withstand it or be rescue from its power ; it do what it please and grow powerful .     as I be reflect , a he - goat with a prominent horn on its forehead suddenly come from the west across the whole earth without touch the ground .      it come to the two - horned ram I have see stand by the river , and rush toward it with savage force .      I see it reach the ram ; enrage , the he - goat attack and shatter both its horn . the ram do not have the strength to withstand it ; the he - goat throw the ram to the ground and trample upon it . no one could rescue the ram from its power .     the he - goat grow very powerful , but at the height of its strength the great horn be shatter , and in its place come up four other , face the four wind of heaven .      out of one of they come a little horn    which grow and grow toward the south , the east , and the glorious land .      it grow even to the host of heaven ,    so that it cast down to earth some of the host and some of the star and trample on they .      it grow even to the Prince of the host , from whom the daily sacrifice be remove , and whose sanctuary be cast down .      the host be give over together with the daily sacrifice in the course of transgression . it cast truth to the ground , and be succeed in its undertaking .     I hear a holy one speak , and another say to whichever one it be that speak , how long shall the event of this vision last concern the daily sacrifice , the desolating sin ,    the giving over of the sanctuary and the host for trample ?      he answer he , for two thousand three hundred evening and morning ; then the sanctuary shall be set right .     while I , Daniel , seek the meaning of the vision I have see , one who look like a man stand before I ,      and on the Ulai I hear a human voice that cry out , Gabriel ,    explain the vision to this man .      when he come near where I be stand , I fall prostrate in terror . but he say to I , understand , o son of man , that the vision refer to the end time .        as he speak to I , I fall forward unconscious ; he touch I and make I stand up .      I will show you , he say , what be to happen in the last day of wrath ; for it be for the appoint time of the end .     the two - horned ram you see represent the king of the Medes and Persians .        the he - goat be the king of the Greeks , and the great horn on its forehead be the first king .      the four that rise in its place when it be shatter be four kingdom that will issue from his nation , but without his strength .     at the end of their reign ,   when sinner have reach their measure , there shall arise a king ,   impudent , and skilled in intrigue .   he shall be strong and powerful ,   bring about fearful ruin ,   and succeed in his undertaking . he shall destroy powerful people ;    his cunning shall be against the holy one ,   his treacherous conduct shall succeed . he shall be proud of heart   and destroy many by stealth . but when he rise against the Prince of prince ,   he shall be break without a hand be raise .   as for the vision of the evening and the morning ,   what be speak be true . but you , keep this vision secret :   it be for the distant future .     I , Daniel , be weak and ill for some day ; then I arise and take care of the king affair . but the vision leave I desolate , without understanding .         '
