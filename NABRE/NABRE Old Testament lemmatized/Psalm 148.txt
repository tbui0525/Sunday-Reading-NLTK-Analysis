b ' all creation summon to praise   Hallelujah ! I praise the   Lord   from the heaven ;   praise he in the height .   praise he , all you his angel ;   give praise , all you his host .    praise he , sun and moon ;   praise he , all shine star .   praise he , high heavens ,    you water above the heavens .   let they all praise the   Lord s name ;   for he command and they be create ,    assign they their station forever ,   set an order that will never change .    II   praise the   Lord   from the earth ,   you sea monster and all the deep of the sea ;    lightning and hail , snow and thick cloud ,   storm wind that fulfill his command ;   Mountains and all hill ,   fruit tree and all cedar ;    animal wild and tame ,   creature that crawl and bird that fly ;    king of the earth and all people ,   prince and all who govern on earth ;   young man and woman too ,   old and young alike .   let they all praise the   Lord s name ,   for his name alone be exalt ,   his majesty above earth and heaven .     he have lift high the horn of his people ;   to the praise of all his faithful ,   the Israelites , the people near to he . Hallelujah !             '
