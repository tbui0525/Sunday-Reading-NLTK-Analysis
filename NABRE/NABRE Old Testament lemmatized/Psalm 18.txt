b ' a king Thanksgiving for victory   for the leader . of David , the servant of the   Lord , who sing to the   Lord   the word of this song after the   Lord   have rescue he from the clutch of all his enemy and from the hand of Saul .      he say :   I I love you ,   Lord , my strength ,    Lord , my rock , my fortress , my deliverer , my God , my rock of refuge ,   my shield , my saving horn ,    my stronghold !    praise be the   Lord , I exclaim !   I have be deliver from my enemy .    II   the cord of death encompass I ;   the torrent of destruction terrify I .   the cord    of Sheol encircle I ;   the snare of death lie in wait for I .    in my distress I call out :   Lord !   I cry out to my God .   from his temple he hear my voice ;   my cry to he reach his ear .    the earth rock and shake ;   the foundation of the mountain tremble ;   they shake as his wrath flare up .    smoke rise from his nostril ,   a devour fire from his mouth ;   it kindle coal into flame .   he part the heaven and come down ,   a dark cloud under his foot .    mount on a cherub    he fly ,   bear along on the wing of the wind .   he make darkness his cloak around he ;   his canopy , water - darken stormcloud .   from the gleam before he , his cloud pass ,   hail and coal of fire .    the   Lord   thunder from heaven ;   the most High make his voice resound .    he let fly his arrow    and scatter they ;   shoot his lightning bolt and disperse they .    then the bed of the sea appear ;   the world foundation lie bare ,   at your rebuke , O   Lord ,   at the storming breath of your nostril .   he reach down from on high and seize I ;   draw I out of the deep water .    he rescue I from my mighty enemy ,   from foe too powerful for I .   they attack I on my day of distress ,   but the   Lord   be my support .   he set I free in the open ;   he rescue I because he love I .    III   the   Lord   acknowledge my righteousness ,   reward my clean hand .    for I keep the way of the   Lord ;   I be not disloyal to my God .   for his law be all before I ,   his decree I do not cast aside .   I be honest toward he ;   I be on guard against sin .   so the   Lord   reward my righteousness ,   the cleanness of my hand in his sight .   toward the faithful you be faithful ;   to the honest man you be honest ;    toward the pure , you be pure ;   but to the perverse you be devious .   for humble people you save ;   haughty eye you bring low .    for you ,   Lord , give light to my lamp ;   my God brighten my darkness .    with you I can rush an armed band ,   with my God to help I can leap a wall .   Gods way be unerre ;   the   Lord s promise be refine ;   he be a shield for all who take refuge in he .     IV   Truly , who be God except the   Lord ?   who but our God be the rock ?    this God who gird I with might ,   keep my way unerre ,   who make my foot like a deer ,   and set I on the height ,    who train my hand for war ,   my arm to string a bow of bronze .      v   you have give I your saving shield ;   your right hand have uphold I ;   your favor make I great .   you make room for my step beneath I ;   my ankle never twist .    I pursue my enemy and overtake they ;   I do not turn back till I destroy they .   I decimate they ; they could not rise ;   they fall at my foot .   you gird I with valor for war ,   subjugate my opponent beneath I .   you make my foe expose their neck to I ;   those who hate I I silence .   they cry for help , but no one save they ;   cry to the   Lord   but receive no answer .   I grind they to dust before the wind ;   I leave they like mud in the street .   you rescue I from the strife of people ;   you make I head over nation . a people I have not know serve I ;    as soon as they hear of I they obey . foreigner submit before I ;    foreigner cringe ;   they come cower from their dungeon .     VI   the   Lord   live ! bless be my rock !    exalted be God , my savior !   o God who grant I vengeance ,   make people subject to I ,     and save I from my enemy , truly you have elevate I above my opponent ,   from a man of lawlessness you have rescue I .   thus I will praise you ,   Lord , among the nation ;   I will sing praise to your name .    you have give great victory to your king ,   and show mercy to his anoint ,   to David and his posterity forever .
