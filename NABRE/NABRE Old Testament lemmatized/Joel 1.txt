b '    the word of the   Lord   which come to Joel , the son of Pethuel .      listen to this , you elder !   pay attention , all who dwell in the land ! have anything like this ever happen in your lifetime ,   or in the lifetime of your ancestor ?   report it to your child .   have your child report it to their child ,   and their child to the next generation .   what the cutter leave ,   the swarm locust have devour ; what the swarm locust leave ,   the hopper have devour ; what the hopper leave ,   the consume locust    have devour .   wake up , you drunkard ,    and weep ;   wail , all you wine drinker , over the new wine ,   take away from your mouth .   for a nation    invade my land ,   powerful and past counting , with tooth like a lion ,   fang like those of a lioness .   it have strip bare my vine ,   splinter my fig tree , shear off its bark and throw it away ,   until its branch turn white .   Wail like a young woman    dress in sackcloth   for the husband of her youth .   grain offering and libation be cut off   from the house of the   Lord ; in mourning be the priest ,   the minister of the   Lord .   the field be devastate ;   the farmland mourn ,   because the grain be devastate ,   the wine have dry up ,   the oil have fail .   be appalled , you farmer !   wail , you vinedresser , over the wheat and the barley ,   because the harvest in the field be ruin .   the vine have dry up ,   the fig tree have wither ; the pomegranate , even the date palm and the apple\xe2\x80\x94   every tree in the field have dry up . Joy itself have dry up   among the people .    cry out to the Lord    Gird yourself and lament , you priest !   wail , minister of the altar ! come , spend the night in sackcloth ,   minister of my God ! for the grain offering and the libation   be withhold from the house of your God .    Proclaim a holy fast !   call an assembly ! gather the elder ,   all who dwell in the land , to the house of the   Lord , your God ,   and cry out to the   Lord !    o ! the day !    for near be the day of the   Lord ,   like destruction from the Almighty it be come !    before our very eye    have not food be cut off ? and from the house of our God ,   joy and gladness ?   the seed lie shrivel beneath clod of dirt ;    the storehouse be empty . the granary be break down ,   for the grain be dry up .    how the animal groan !   the herd of cattle be bewilder ! because they have no pasture ,   even the flock of sheep be starve .   to you ,   Lord , I cry !   for fire have devour the wilderness pasture ,   flame have scorch all the tree in the field .   even the animal in the wild   cry out to you ; for the stream of water have run dry ,   and fire have devour the wilderness pasture .
