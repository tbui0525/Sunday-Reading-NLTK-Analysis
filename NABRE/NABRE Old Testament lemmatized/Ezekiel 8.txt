b '    in the sixth year , on the fifth day of the sixth month ,    as I be sit in my house , with the elder of Judah sit before I , the hand of the Lord   God   fall upon I there .        I look up and there be a figure that look like a man .    Downward from what look like his waist , there be fire ; from his waist upward , like the brilliance of polished bronze .     Vision of abomination in the Temple .     he stretch out the form of a hand and seize I by the hair of my head . the spirit lift I up    between earth and heaven and bring I in divine vision to Jerusalem    to the entrance of the inner gate face north where the statue of jealousy that provoke jealousy stand .      there I see the glory of the God of Israel , like the vision I have see in the plain .        he say to I : Son of man , lift your eye to the north ! I look to the north and there in the entry north of the altar gate be this statue of jealousy .        he ask , Son of man , do you see what they be do ? do you see the great abomination that the house of Israel be practice here , so that I must depart from my sanctuary ? you shall see even great abomination !      then he bring I to the entrance of the courtyard , and there I see a hole in the wall .      Son of man , he order , dig through the wall . I dig through the wall\xe2\x80\x94there be a doorway .      go in , he say to I , and see the evil abomination they be do here .      I go in and looked\xe2\x80\x94figure of all kind of creep thing and loathsome beast ,    all the idol of the house of Israel ,    picture around the wall .      before they stand seventy of the elder of the house of Israel . among they stand Jaazaniah , son of Shaphan , each with censer in hand ; a cloud of incense drift upward .        then he say to I : do you see , son of man , what the elder of the house of Israel be do in the dark , each in his idol chamber ? they think : the   Lord   can not see we ; the   Lord   have forsake the land .        he say : you will see they practice even great abomination .     then he bring I to the entrance of the north gate of the house of the   Lord . there woman sit and weep for Tammuz .         he say to I : do you see this , son of man ? you will see other abomination , great than these !     then he bring I into the inner court of the house of the   Lord . there at the door of the   Lord s temple , between the porch and the altar , be about twenty - five man with their back to the   Lord s temple and their face toward the east ; they be bow eastward    to the sun .        he say : do you see , son of man ? be the abominable thing the house of Judah have do here so slight that they should also fill the land with violence , provoke I again and again ? now they be put the branch to my nose !        therefore I in turn will act furiously : my eye will not spare , nor will I take pity . even if they cry out in a loud voice for I to hear , I shall not listen to they .
