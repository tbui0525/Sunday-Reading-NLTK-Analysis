b '   Song of Deborah .      on that day Deborah sing this song\xe2\x80\x94and Barak , son of Abinoam :      when uprising break out in Israel ,   when the people rally for duty\xe2\x80\x94bless the   Lord !   hear , o king ! give ear , o prince !   I will sing , I will sing to the   Lord ,   I will make music to the   Lord , the God of Israel .     Lord , when you go out from Seir ,   when you march from the plain of Edom , the earth shake , the heavens pour ,   the cloud pour rain ,   the mountain stream ,   before the   Lord , the one of Sinai ,   before the   Lord , the God of Israel .   in the day of Shamgar , son of Anath ,    in the day of Jael , caravan cease : those who travel the road   now travel by roundabout path .    gone be freedom beyond the wall ,   go indeed from Israel . when I , Deborah , arise ,   when I arise , a mother in Israel .    new god be their choice ;   then war be at the gate . no shield be to be find , no spear ,   among forty thousand in Israel !   my heart be with the leader of Israel ,   with the dedicated one of the people\xe2\x80\x94bless the   Lord ;   those who ride on white donkey ,   seat on saddle rug ,   and those who travel the road , sing of they    to the sound of musician at the well . there they recount the just deed of the   Lord ,   his just deed bring freedom to Israel .   Awake , awake , Deborah !   Awake , awake , strike up a song ! Arise , Barak !   take captive your captor , son of Abinoam !   then down go Israel against the mighty ,   the army of the   Lord   go down for he against the warrior .    from Ephraim , their base in the valley ;   behind you , Benjamin , among your troop . from Machir come down commander ,   from Zebulun wielder of the marshal staff .   the prince of Issachar be with Deborah ,   Issachar , faithful to Barak ;   in the valley they follow at his heel . among the clan of Reuben   great be the searching of heart !   why do you stay beside your hearth   listen to the lowing of the herd ? among the clan of Reuben   great be the searching of heart !   Gilead stay beyond the Jordan ;   why do Dan spend his time in ship ? Asher remain along the shore ,   he stay in his haven .   Zebulun be a people who defy death ,   Naphtali , too , on the open height !    the king come and fight ;   then they fight , those king of Canaan , at Taanach by the water of Megiddo ;   no spoil of silver do they take .   from the heaven the star    fight ;   from their course they fight against Sisera .    the Wadi Kishon sweep they away ;   the wadi overwhelm they , the Wadi Kishon .    trample down the strong !    then the hoof of the horse hammer ,   the gallop , gallop of steed .   Curse Meroz ,    say the messenger of the   Lord ,   curse , curse its inhabitant ! for they do not come when the   Lord   help ,   the help of the   Lord   against the warrior .   most blessed of woman be Jael ,    the wife of Heber the Kenite ,   bless among tent - dwelling woman !   he ask for water , she give he milk ,   in a princely bowl she bring he curds .     with her hand she reach for the peg ,   with her right hand , the workmans hammer . she hammer Sisera , crush his head ;   she smash , pierce his temple .   at her foot he sink down , fall , lay still ;   down at her foot he sink and fall ;   where he sink down , there he fall , slay .      from the window she look down ,   the mother of Sisera peer through the lattice : why be his chariot so long in come ?   why be the hoofbeat of his chariot delay ?   the wise of her princess answer she ;   she even reply to herself ,   they must be divide the spoil they take :   a slave woman or two for each man , Spoil of dye cloth for Sisera ,   spoil of ornate dye cloth ,   a pair of ornate dye cloth for my neck in the spoil .     so perish all your enemy , o   Lord !    but may those who love you be like the sun rise in its might ! and the land be at rest for forty year .
