b '   Davids aid reject .     now the Philistines have muster all their force in Aphek , and the Israelites be encamped at the spring in Jezreel .        as the philistine lord be march their unit of a hundred and a thousand , David and his warrior be march in the rear guard with Achish .      the philistine commander ask , what be those Hebrews do here ? Achish answer they : why , that be David , the officer of Saul , king of Israel . he have be with I for a year or two , and from the day he come over to I until now I have never find fault in he .        but the philistine commander be anger at this and say to he : send that man back ! let he return to the place you pick out for he . he must not go down into battle with we ; during the battle he might become our enemy . for how else can he win back his master favor , if not at the expense of our soldier ?        be this not the David for whom they sing during their dance , Saul have slay his thousand ,   David his ten of thousand ?      so Achish summon David and say to he : as the   Lord   live , you be honest , and I would want you with I in all my battle . to this day I have find nothing wrong with you since you come to I . but in the view of the chief you be not welcome .      leave peacefully , now , and do nothing that might displease the philistine chief .      but David say to Achish : what have I do ? what fault have you find in your servant from the day I enter your service until today , that I can not go to fight against the enemy of my lord the king ?
