b ' A prayer for Jerusalem   a psalm of Asaph . I o God , the nation have invade your inheritance ;   they have defile your holy temple ;   they have lay Jerusalem in ruin .    they have leave the corpse of your servant   as food for the bird of the sky ,   the flesh of those devote to you for the beast of the earth .    they have pour out their blood like water   all around Jerusalem ,   and no one be leave to do the burying .    we have become the reproach of our neighbor ,   the scorn and derision of those around we .     II   how long ,   Lord ? will you be angry forever ?   will your jealous anger keep burn like fire ?    pour out your wrath on nation that do not recognize you ,   on kingdom that do not call on your name ,    for they have devour Jacob ,   lay waste his dwelling place .   do not remember against we the iniquity of our forefather ;   let your compassion move quickly ahead of we ,   for we have be bring very low .     III   help we , God our savior ,   on account of the glory of your name . deliver we , pardon our sin   for your name sake .    why should the nation say ,   where be their God ?   before our eye make known to the nation   that you avenge the blood of your servant which have be pour out .     IV   let the groaning of the imprison come in before you ;   in accord with the greatness of your arm   preserve those doom to die .    turn back sevenfold into the bosom of our neighbor   the insult with which they insult you , Lord .    then we , your people , the sheep of your pasture ,   will give thank to you forever ;   from generation to generation   we will recount your praise .
