b ' A prayer for Deliverance from the Wicked I   Lord , avenge God ,   avenge God , shine forth !    rise up , o judge of the earth ;   give the proud what they deserve !     II   how long ,   Lord , shall the wicked ,   how long shall the wicked glory ?    how long will they mouth haughty speech ,   go on boasting , all these evildoer ?    they crush your people ,   Lord ,   torment your very own .   they kill the widow and alien ;   the orphan they murder .    they say , the   Lord   do not see ;   the God of Jacob take no notice .     III   Understand , you stupid people !   you fool , when will you be wise ?    do the one who shape the ear not hear ?   the one who form the eye not see ?    do the one who guide nation not rebuke ?   the one who teach man not have knowledge ?   the   Lord   know the plan of man ;   they be like a fleeting breath .     IV   bless the one whom you guide ,   Lord ,    whom you teach by your instruction ,   to give rest from evil day ,   while a pit be be dig for the wicked .   for the   Lord   will not forsake his people ,   nor abandon his inheritance .    Judgment shall again be just ,   and all the upright of heart will follow it .    v   who will rise up for I against the wicked ?   who will stand up for I against evildoer ?   if the   Lord   be not my help ,   I would long have be silent in the grave .    when I say , my foot be slip ,   your mercy ,   Lord , hold I up .    when care increase within I ,   your comfort give I joy .    VI   can unjust judge be your ally ,   those who create burden by decree ,   those who conspire against the just   and condemn the innocent to death ?   no , the   Lord   be my secure height ,   my God , my rock of refuge ,    who will turn back their evil upon they    and destroy they for their wickedness .   surely the   Lord   our God will destroy they !
