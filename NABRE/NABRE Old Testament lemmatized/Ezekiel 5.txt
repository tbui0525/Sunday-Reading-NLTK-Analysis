b '    now you , son of man , take a sharp sword and use it like a barber razor , to shave your head and your beard . then take a balance scale for weigh and divide the hair .        set a third on fire within the city ,    when the day of your siege be complete ; place another third around the city and strike it with the sword ; the final third scatter to the wind and then unsheathe the sword after it .        but take a few of the hair and tie they in the hem of your garment .      take some of these and throw they into the fire and burn they in the fire . because of this , fire will flash out against the whole house of Israel .     thus say the Lord   God : this be Jerusalem ! I place it in the midst of the nation , surround by foreign land .      but it rebel against my ordinance more wickedly than the nation , and against my statute more than the foreign land around it ; they reject my ordinance and do not walk in my statute .        therefore , thus say the Lord   God : because you have cause more uproar than the nation surround you , not live by my statute nor carry out my judgment , nor even live by the ordinance of the surround nation ;      therefore , thus say the Lord   God : see , I be come against you !    I will carry out judgment among you while the nation look on .        because of all your abomination I will do to you what I have never do before , the like of which I will never do again .      therefore , parent will eat their child in your midst , and child will eat their parent .    I will inflict punishment upon you and scatter all who remain to the wind .      therefore , as I live , say the Lord   God , because you have defile my sanctuary with all your atrocity and all your abomination , I will surely withdraw and not look upon you with pity nor spare you .        a third of your people shall die of disease or starve to death within you ; another third shall fall by the sword all around you ; a third I will scatter to the wind and pursue they with the sword .      thus my anger will spend itself ; I will vent my wrath against they until I be satisfied . then they will know that I the   Lord   speak in my passion when I spend my wrath upon they .        I will make you a desolation and a reproach among the nation around you , in the sight of every passerby .        and you will be a reproach and a taunt , a warning and a horror to the nation around you when I execute judgment against you in angry wrath , with furious chastisement . I , the   Lord , have speak !      when I loose against you the deadly arrow of starvation that I be send to destroy you , I will increase starvation and will break your staff of bread .        I will send against you starvation and wild beast who will leave you childless , while disease and bloodshed sweep through you . I will bring the sword against you . I , the   Lord , have speak .              '
