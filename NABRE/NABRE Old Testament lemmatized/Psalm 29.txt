b ' the Lord of Majesty Acclaimed as King of the World   a psalm of David . I give to the   Lord , you son of God ,    give to the   Lord   glory and might ;   give to the   Lord   the glory due his name .   bow down before the   Lord s holy splendor !     II   the voice of the   Lord    be over the water ;   the God of glory thunder ,   the   Lord , over the mighty water .   the voice of the   Lord   be power ;   the voice of the   Lord   be splendor .    the voice of the   Lord   crack the cedar ;   the   Lord   splinter the cedar of Lebanon ,   make Lebanon leap like a calf ,   and Sirion    like a young bull .   the voice of the   Lord   strike with fiery flame ;    the voice of the   Lord   shake the desert ;   the   Lord   shake the desert of Kadesh .    the voice of the   Lord   make the deer dance   and strip the forest bare .   all in his Temple say , Glory !    III   the   Lord   sits enthrone above the flood !     the   Lord   reign as king forever !   may the   Lord   give might to his people ;    may the   Lord   bless his people with peace !
