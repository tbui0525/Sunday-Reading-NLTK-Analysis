b ' a Psalm for a Royal Coronation   why do the nation protest   and the people conspire in vain ?    king on earth rise up   and prince plot together   against the   Lord   and against his anoint one :     let we break their shackle   and cast off their chain from we !    the one enthrone in heaven laugh ;   the Lord deride they ,    then he speak to they in his anger ,   in his wrath he terrify they :   I myself have instal my king   on Zion , my holy mountain .   I will proclaim the decree of the   Lord ,   he say to I , you be my son ;   today I have beget you .    ask it of I ,   and I will give you the nation as your inheritance ,   and , as your possession , the end of the earth .   with an iron rod you will shepherd they ,   like a potter vessel you will shatter they .    and now , king , give heed ;   take warning , judge on earth .   serve the   Lord   with fear ;   exult with tremble , accept correction   lest he become angry and you perish along the way   when his anger suddenly blaze up .   bless be all who take refuge in he !
