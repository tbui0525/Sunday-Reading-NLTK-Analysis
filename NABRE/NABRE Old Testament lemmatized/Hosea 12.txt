b '   Infidelity of Israel    Ephraim have surround I with lie ,   the house of Israel , with deceit ; Judah still wander about with god ,   and be faithful to holy one .     Ephraim shepherd the wind ,   and pursue the east wind all day long . he multiply lie and violence :   they make a covenant with Assyria ,   and oil be carry to Egypt .     the   Lord   have a dispute with Judah ,   and will punish Jacob    for his conduct ,   and repay he for his deed .   in the womb he supplant his brother ,    and in his vigor he contend with a divine being ;   he contend with an angel and prevail ,    he weep and entreat he . at Bethel he meet with he ,   and there he speak with he .    the   Lord   be the God of host ,   the   Lord   be his name !    you must return to your God .   maintain loyalty and justice   and always hope in your God .     a merchant who hold a false balance ,   he love to extort !   Ephraim have say ,   how rich I have become ;   I have make a fortune !   all his gain will not suffice   for the guilt of his sin .   I the   Lord   have be your God ,   since the land of Egypt ;   I will again have you live in tent ,   as on feast day .   I speak to the prophet ,   I grant many vision ,    and through the prophet I tell parable .   in Gilead be falsehood , they have come to nothing ;   in Gilgal they sacrifice bull , but their altar be like heap of stone    in the furrow of the field .     Jacob flee to the land of Aram ,   and Israel serve for a wife ;   for a wife he tend sheep .    but by a prophet    the   Lord   bring Israel out of Egypt ,   and by a prophet Israel be tend .    Ephraim have arouse bitter anger ,   so his Lord shall cast his bloodguilt upon he   and repay he for his scorn .             '
