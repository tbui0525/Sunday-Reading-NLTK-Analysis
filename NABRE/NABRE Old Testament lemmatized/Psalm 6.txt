b ' prayer in Distress   for the leader ; with stringed instrument , upon the eighth .   a psalm of David .    I   do not reprove I in your anger ,   Lord ,   nor punish I in your wrath .    have pity on I ,   Lord , for I be weak ;   heal I ,   Lord , for my bone be shudder .    my soul too be shudder greatly\xe2\x80\x94   and you ,   Lord , how long\xe2\x80\xa6 ?     turn back ,   Lord , rescue my soul ;   save I because of your mercy .   for in death there be no remembrance of you .   who praise you in Sheol ?      II   I be weary with sighing ;   all night long I drench my bed with tear ;   I soak my couch with weeping .   my eye be dim with sorrow ,   wear out because of all my foe .     III   away from I , all who do evil !    the   Lord   have hear the sound of my weeping .   the   Lord   have hear my plea ;   the   Lord   will receive my prayer .   my foe will all be disgrace and will shudder greatly ;   they will turn back in sudden disgrace .
