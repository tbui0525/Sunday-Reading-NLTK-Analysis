b '   against the City of Tyre .      on the first day of the eleventh month of the eleventh year , the word of the   Lord   come to I :      Son of man , because Tyre say of Jerusalem : Aha ! the gateway of the people be smash !   it have be turn over to I ;   I will be enrich by its ruin !     therefore thus say the Lord   God : see ! I be come against you , Tyre ;   I will churn up against you many nation ,   just as the sea churn up its wave .   they will destroy the wall of Tyre   and tear down its tower ; I will scrape off its debris   and leave it a bare rock .    it will become a place for dry net   in the midst of the sea . for I have spoken\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the Lord   God :   she will become plunder for the nation .   her daughter city    on the mainland   will be slaughter by the sword ;   then they shall know that I be the   Lord .   indeed thus say the Lord   God : I be bring up against Tyre   from the north , Nebuchadnezzar , king of Babylon , king of king ,   with horse and chariot , with cavalry ,   and a mighty horde of troop .    your daughter city on the mainland   he shall slay with the sword . he shall build a siege wall around you ,   throw up a ramp against you ,   and raise his shield about you .   he shall pound your wall with battering - ram   and break down your tower with his axis .   from the surge of his horse   he will cover you with dust ;   from the noise of warhorse ,   wheel and chariot . your wall will shake   when he enter your gate ,   even as one enter a city that be breach .   with the hoof of his horse   he will trample all your street ; your people he will slay by the sword ;   your mighty pillar will collapse .    they shall plunder your wealth   and pillage your good ; they will tear down your wall   and demolish your splendid house . your stone , timber , and debris   they will cast into the sea .   I will bring an end to the noise of your song ;   the music of your lyre will be hear no more .   I will turn you into bare rock ,   you will become a place for dry net . you shall never be rebuild ,   for I the   Lord   have spoken\xe2\x80\x94   oracle of the Lord   God .   thus say the Lord   God   to Tyre : at the sound of your downfall ,   at the groaning of the wound , when victim be slay within you ,   will the island not quake ?   all the prince of the sea    will step down from their throne , lay aside their robe ,   and strip off their embroider garment . clothe in mourning ,   they will sit on the ground and tremble , horror - strike   and appal at you .    they will raise lament    over you   and say to you : how you have perish ,   go from the sea ,   Renowned City ! once she be mighty on the sea ,   she and her inhabitant , those who spread their terror   to all who dwelt nearby .    on this , the day of your fall ,   the island quake ! the island in the sea   be terrify at your passing .   indeed thus say the Lord   God : when I make you a ruin city   like city no long inhabit , when I churn up the deep   and its mighty water cover you ,   then I will thrust you down   with those who go down to the pit ,    to those of the bygone age ; I will make you dwell in the netherworld ,   in the everlasting ruin ,   with those who have go down to the pit , so you will never return   or have a place in the land of the living .    I will make you a horror ,   and you shall be no more ; you shall be seek for ,   but never find again\xe2\x80\x94   oracle of the Lord   God .             '
