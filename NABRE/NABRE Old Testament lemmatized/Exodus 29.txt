Aaron and his son you shall also bring to the entrance of the tent of meeting , and there wash they with water .      take the vestment and clothe Aaron with the tunic , the robe of the ephod , the ephod itself , and the breastpiece , fasten the embroider belt of the ephod around he .      put the turban on his head , the sacred diadem on the turban .      then take the anoint oil and pour it on his head , and anoint he .      bring forward his son also and clothe they with the tunic ,      gird they with the sash , and tie the skullcap on they .    thus shall the priesthood be theirs by a perpetual statute , and thus shall you install Aaron and his son .    Installation Sacrifices .      now bring forward the bull in front of the tent of meeting . there Aaron and his son shall lay their hand on its head .      then slaughter the bull before the   Lord , at the entrance of the tent of meeting .      take some of its blood and with your finger put it on the horn of the altar . all the rest of the blood you shall pour out at the base of the altar .      all the fat that cover its inner organ , as well as the lobe of its liver and its two kidney , together with the fat that be on they , you shall take and burn on the altar .      but the meat and hide and dung of the bull you must burn up outside the camp , since this be a purification offering .      then take one of the ram , and after Aaron and his son have lay their hand on its head ,      slaughter it . the blood you shall take and splash on all the side of the altar .      cut the ram into piece ; you shall wash its inner organ and shank and put they with the piece and with the head .      then you shall burn the entire ram on the altar , since it be a burn offering , a sweet - smell oblation to the   Lord .     after this take the other ram , and when Aaron and his son have lay their hand on its head ,      slaughter it . some of its blood you shall take and put on the tip of Aarons right ear and on the tip of his son right ear and on the thumb of their right hand and the great toe of their right foot . splash the rest of the blood on all the side of the altar .      then take some of the blood that be on the altar , together with some of the anoint oil , and sprinkle this on Aaron and his vestment , as well as on his son and their vestment , that he and his son and their vestment may be sacred .     now , from this ram you shall take its fat : its fatty tail ,    the fat that cover its inner organ , the lobe of its liver , its two kidney with the fat that be on they , and its right thigh , since this be the ram for installation ;      then , out of the basket of unleavened food that you have set before the   Lord , you shall take one of the loaf of bread , one of the cake make with oil , and one of the wafer .      all these thing you shall put into the hand of Aaron and his son , so that they may raise they as an elevated offering    before the   Lord .      after you receive they back from their hand , you shall burn they on top of the burn offering on the altar as a sweet - smell oblation to the   Lord .      finally , take the brisket of Aarons installation ram and raise it as an elevated offering before the   Lord ; this be to be your own portion .      thus shall you set aside the brisket of whatever elevated offering be raise ,    as well as the thigh of whatever contribution be raise up , whether this be the installation ram or anything else belong to Aaron or to his son .      such thing be due to Aaron and his son from the Israelites by a perpetual statute as a contribution . from their communion offering , too , the Israelites shall make a contribution , their contribution to the   Lord .     the sacred vestment    of Aaron shall be pass down to his son after he , that in they they may be anoint and instal .      the son who succeed he as priest and who be to enter the tent of meeting to minister in the sanctuary shall be clothe with they for seven day .      you shall take the installation ram and boil its meat in a holy place .      at the entrance of the tent of meet Aaron and his son shall eat the meat of the ram and the bread that be in the basket .      they themselves be to eat of these thing by which atonement be make at their installation and consecration ; but no unauthorized person may eat of they , since they be sacred .      if some of the meat of the installation sacrifice or some of the bread remain over on the next day , this remnant you must burn up ; it be not to be eat , since it be sacred .     carry out all these command in regard to Aaron and his son just as I have give they to you .    seven day you shall spend instal they ,       sacrifice a bull each day as a purification offering , to make atonement . thus you shall purify the altar    by purge it , and you shall anoint it in order to consecrate it .      seven day you shall spend in purge the altar and in consecrate it . then the altar will be most sacred , and whatever touch it will become sacred .      now , this be what you shall regularly offer on the altar : two yearling lamb    as the sacrifice establish for each day ;      one lamb in the morning and the other lamb at the evening twilight .      with the first lamb there shall be a tenth of an ephah of bran flour mix with a fourth of a hin    of oil of crush olive and , as its libation , a fourth of a hin of wine .      the other lamb you shall offer at the evening twilight , with the same grain offering and libation as in the morning . you shall offer this as a sweet - smell oblation to the   Lord .      throughout your generation this regular burn offering shall be make before the   Lord   at the entrance of the tent of meeting , where I will meet you and speak to you .     there , at the altar , I will meet the Israelites ; hence , it will be make sacred by my glory .        thus I will consecrate the tent of meeting and the altar , just as I also consecrate Aaron and his son to be my priest .      I will dwell in the midst of the Israelites and will be their God .      they shall know that I , the   Lord , be their God who bring they out of the land of Egypt , so that I , the   Lord , their God , might dwell among they .
