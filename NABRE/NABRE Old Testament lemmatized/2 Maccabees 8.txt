Judas Maccabeus and his companion enter the village secretly , summon their kindred , and enlist other who have remain faithful to Judaism . thus they assemble about six thousand man .      they implore the Lord to look kindly upon this people , who be be oppress by all ; to have pity on the sanctuary , which be profane by renegade ;      to have mercy on the city , which be be destroy and be about to be level to the ground ; to listen to the blood that cry out to he ;      to remember the criminal slaughter of innocent child and the blasphemy utter against his name ; and to manifest his hatred of evil .      once Maccabeus get his man organize , the Gentiles could not withstand he , for the Lords wrath have now change to mercy .      come by surprise upon town and village , he set they on fire . he capture strategic position , and put to flight not a few of the enemy .      he prefer the night as be especially favorable for such attack . soon talk of his valor spread everywhere . first Victory over Nicanor .        when Philip see that Judas be gain ground little by little and that his successful advance be become more frequent , he write to Ptolemy , governor of Coelesyria and Phoenicia , to come to the aid of the king interest .         Ptolemy promptly select Nicanor , son of Patroclus , one of the Chief Friends , and send he at the head of at least twenty thousand armed man of various nation to wipe out the entire jewish nation . with he he associate Gorgias , a general , experience in the art of war .        Nicanor plan to raise the two thousand talent of tribute owe by the king to the Romans    by sell capture Jews into slavery .      so he immediately send word to the coastal city , invite they to buy jewish slave and promise to deliver ninety slave for a talent   \xe2\x80\x94little anticipate the punishment that be to fall upon he from the Almighty .     when Judas learn of nicanor advance and inform his companion about the approach of the army ,      those who be fearful and those who lack faith in Gods justice desert and get away .      but the other sell everything they have leave , and at the same time entreat the Lord to deliver those whom the ungodly Nicanor have sell before even capture they .      they entreat the Lord to do this , if not for their sake , at least for the sake of the covenant make with their ancestor , and because they themselves invoke his holy and glorious name .      Maccabeus assemble his force , six thousand strong , and exhort they not to be panic - stricken before the enemy , nor to fear the very large number of Gentiles unjustly attack they , but to fight nobly .      they be to keep before their eye the lawless outrage perpetrate by the Gentiles against the holy place and the affliction of the humiliated city , as well as the subversion of their ancestral way of life .      he say , they trust in weapon and act of dare , but we trust in almighty God , who can by a mere nod destroy not only those who attack we but even the whole world .      he go on to tell they of the time when help have be give their ancestor : both the time of Sennacherib , when a hundred and eighty - five thousand of his man perish ,        and the time of the battle in Babylonia against the Galatians ,    when only eight thousand Jews fight along with four thousand Macedonians ; yet when the Macedonians be hard press , the eight thousand , by the help they receive from Heaven , destroy one hundred and twenty thousand and take a great quantity of spoil .       with these word he encourage they and make they ready to die for their law and their country . then Judas divide his army into four ,      place his brother , Simon , Joseph ,    and Jonathan , each over a division , assign they fifteen hundred man apiece .        there be also Eleazar .    after read to they from the holy book and give they the watchword , the help of God , Judas himself take charge of the first division and join in battle with Nicanor .        with the Almighty as their ally , they kill more than nine thousand of the enemy , wound and disable the great part of Nicanors army , and put all of they to flight .      they also seize the money of those who have come to buy they as slave . when they have pursue the enemy for some time , they be oblige to return by reason of the late hour .      it be the day before the sabbath , and for that reason they could not continue the pursuit .      they collect the enemys weapon and strip they of their spoil , and then observe the sabbath with fervent praise and thank to the Lord who keep they safe for that day on which he allot they the beginning of his mercy .      after the sabbath , they give a share of the spoil to those who be torture and to widow and orphan ; the rest they divide among themselves and their child .        when this be do , they make supplication in common , implore the merciful Lord to be completely reconcile with his servant .    other victory .     they also challenge the force of Timothy and Bacchides , kill more than twenty thousand of they , and capture some very high fortress . they divide the considerable plunder , allot half to themselves and the rest to victim of torture , orphan , widow , and the aged .      they collect the enemy weapon and carefully store they in strategic place ; the rest of the spoil they carry to Jerusalem .      they also kill the commander of Timothys force , a most wicked man , who have do great harm to the Jews .      while celebrate the victory in their ancestral city , they burn both those who have set fire to the sacred gate and Callisthenes , who have take refuge in a little house ; so he receive the reward his wicked deed deserve .      the thrice - accursed Nicanor , who have bring the thousand slave dealer to buy the Jews ,      after be humble through the Lords help by those whom he have think of no account , lay aside his fine clothe and flee alone across country like a runaway slave , until he reach Antioch . he be eminently successful in destroy his own army .      so he who have promise to provide tribute for the Romans by the capture of the people of Jerusalem proclaim that the Jews have a champion , and that because they follow the law lay down by he , they be unharmed .
