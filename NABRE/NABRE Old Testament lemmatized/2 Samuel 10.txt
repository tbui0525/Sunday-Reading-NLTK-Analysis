b '   campaign against Ammon .      after this ,    the king of the Ammonites die , and Hanun his son succeed he as king .      David say , I will show kindness to Hanun , the son of Nahash , as his father show kindness to I . therefore David send his servant to Hanun to console he concern his father . but when Davids servant have enter the land of the Ammonites ,      the ammonite prince say to their lord Hanun , do you think David be do this\xe2\x80\x94sende you these consolers\xe2\x80\x94to honor your father ? be it not rather to explore the city , to spy on it , and to overthrow it , that David have send his servant to you ?      so Hanun seize Davids servant , shave off half their beard , cut away the low half of their garment at the buttock , and send they away .        David be tell of it and he send word for they to be intercept , for the man have be greatly disgrace . remain at Jericho , the king tell they , until your beard have grow again ; then come back here .      when the Ammonites realize that they be in bad odor with David , they send for and hire twenty thousand aramean foot soldier from Beth - rehob and Zobah , as well as the king of Maacah with one thousand man , and twelve thousand man from Tob .      when David hear of this , he send Joab and his whole army of warrior against they .        the Ammonites march out and line up for battle at the entrance of their city gate , while the Arameans of Zobah and Rehob and the man of Tob and Maacah remain apart in the open field .      when Joab see that there be a battle line both in front of and behind he , he choose some of the good fighter of Israel and line they up against the Arameans ;      the rest of the army he place under the command of his brother Abishai and line up to oppose the Ammonites .      and he say , if the Arameans prove too strong for I , you must come and save I ; and if the Ammonites prove too strong for you , I will come to save you .      hold firm and let we show ourselves courageous for the sake of our people and the city of our God ; and may the   Lord   do what be good in his sight .      Joab therefore advance with his man for battle with the Arameans , but they flee before he .      and when the Ammonites see that the Arameans have flee , they too flee before Abishai , and reentere their city . Joab then cease his attack on the Ammonites and come to Jerusalem .       see themselves vanquish by Israel , the Arameans hold a full muster of troop .      Hadadezer send for and bring Arameans from beyond the River . they come to Helam , with Shobach , the captain of Hadadezers army , at their head .      when this be report to David , he gather all Israel together , cross the Jordan , and go to Helam . the Arameans draw up in formation against David and give battle .      but the Arameans flee before Israel , and David kill seven hundred of their chariot fighter and forty thousand of their foot soldier . he strike down Shobach , commander of the army , and he die on the field .      when Hadadezers vassal king see themselves vanquish by Israel , they make peace with the Israelites and become their subject . after this , the Arameans be afraid to give further aid to the Ammonites .
