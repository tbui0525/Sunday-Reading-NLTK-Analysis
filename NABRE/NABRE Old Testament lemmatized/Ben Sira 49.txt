b '   Josiah and the Prophets    the name   Josiah   be like blend incense ,   make last by a skilled perfumer .   precious be his memory , like honey to the taste ,   like music at a banquet .   for he grieve over our betrayal ,   and destroy the abominable idol .   he keep his heart fix on God ,   and in time of lawlessness practice virtue .   except for David , Hezekiah , and Josiah ,   they all be wicked ; they abandon the Law of the most high ,   these king of Judah , right to the very end .   so he give over their power to other ,   their glory to a foreign nation   who burn the holy city   and leave its street desolate ,   as foretell by   Jeremiah .    they mistreat he   who even in the womb have be make a prophet , to root out , pull down , and destroy ,   and then to build and to plant .    Ezekiel   behold a vision   and describe the different creature of the chariot ;    he also refer to   Job ,   who always persevere in the right path .    then , too , the   Twelve    Prophets \xe2\x80\x94   may their bone flourish with new life where they lie!\xe2\x80\x94 they give new strength to Jacob   and save he with steadfast hope .    the Heroes after the exile   how to extol   Zerubbabel ?    he be like a signet ring on the right hand ,    and   Jeshua , Jozadaks son ?   in their time they rebuild the altar and erect the holy temple ,   destine for everlasting glory .   exalted be the memory of   Nehemiah !   he rebuild our ruin wall , restore our shattered defense ,   and set up gate and bar .     the early Patriarchs   few on earth have be create like   Enoch ;    he also be take up bodily .    be ever a man bear like   Joseph ?   even his dead body be provide for .    glorious , too , be   Shem   and   Seth   and   Enosh ;   but beyond that of any living being be the splendor of   Adam .
