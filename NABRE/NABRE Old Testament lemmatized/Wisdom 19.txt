b '    but merciless wrath assail the wicked until the end ,   for God know beforehand what they be yet to do :    that though they themselves have agree to the departure   and have anxiously send they on their way ,   they would regret it and pursue they .    for while they be still engage in funeral rite   and mourn at the burial of the dead , they adopt another senseless plan :   those whom they have drive out with entreaty   they now pursue as fugitive .    for a compulsion appropriate to this ending draw they on ,   and make they forget what have befall they , that they might complete the torment of their punishment ,    and your people might experience a glorious    journey   while those other meet an extraordinary death .      for all creation , in its several kind , be be make over anew ,   serve your command , that your child might be preserve unharmed .    the cloud overshadow their camp ;   and out of what have be water , dry land be see emerge : out of the Red Sea an unimpeded road ,   and a grassy plain out of the mighty flood .    over this cross the whole nation shelter by your hand ,   and they behold stupendous wonder .   for they range about like horse ,   and leapt like lamb ,   praise you ,   Lord , their deliverer .    for they be still mindful of what have happen in their sojourn :   how instead of the young of animal the land bring forth gnat ,   and instead of fish the river swarm with countless frog .    and later they see also a new kind of bird    when , prompt by desire , they ask for pleasant food ;   for to appease they quail come to they from the sea .   and the punishment come upon the sinner   not without forewarning from the violence of the thunderbolt .    for they justly suffer for their own misdeed ,   since they treat their guest with the more grievous    hatred .    for those other    do not receive unfamiliar visitor ,    but these be enslave beneficent guest .   and not that only ; but what punishment be to be theirs    since they receive stranger unwillingly !   yet these ,    after welcome they with festivity ,   oppress with awful toil   those who have share with they the same right .    and they be strike with blindness ,    as those other have be at the door of the righteous man\xe2\x80\x94 when , surround by yawn darkness ,   each seek the entrance of his own door .      for the element , in ever - change harmony ,   like string of the harp , produce new melody ,   while the flow of music steadily persist . and this can be perceive exactly from a review of what take place .   for land creature be change into water creature ,   and those that swam go over on land .   Fire in water maintain its own strength ,    and water forget its quenching nature ;   flame , by contrast , neither consume the flesh   of the perishable animal that go about in they ,   nor melt the icelike , quick - melt kind of ambrosial food .   for every way ,   Lord ! you magnify and glorify your people ;   unfailing , you stand by they in every time and circumstance .
