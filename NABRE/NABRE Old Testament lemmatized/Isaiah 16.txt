b '    send they forth ,    hug the earth like reptile ,   from Sela across the desert ,   to the mount of daughter Zion .   like flushed bird ,   like scattered nestling , be the daughter of Moab   at the ford of the Arnon .      offer counsel , take their part ;   at high noon make your shade like the night ; hide the outcast ,   do not betray the fugitive .   let the outcast of Moab live with you ,   be their shelter from the destroyer . when there be an end to the oppressor ,   when destruction have cease ,   and the marauder have vanish from the land ,   a throne shall be set up in mercy ,   and on it shall sit in fidelity ,   in Davids tent , a judge uphold right ,   prompt to do justice .    we have hear of the pride of Moab ,   how very proud he be , of his haughtiness , pride , and arrogance   that his empty word do not match .     therefore let Moab wail ,   let everyone wail for Moab ; for the raisin cake    of Kir - hareseth   let they sigh , stricken with grief .   the terraced slope of Heshbon languish ,   the vine of Sibmah , whose cluster once overpower   the lord of nation , reach as far as Jazer   wind through the wilderness ,   whose branch spread forth ,   cross over the sea .   therefore I weep with Jazer   for the vine of Sibmah ; I drench you with my tear ,   Heshbon and Elealeh ; for on your summer fruit and harvest   the battle cry    have fall .    from the orchard be take away   joy and gladness , in the vineyard there be no singing ,   no shout of joy ; in the wine press no one tread grape ,   the vintage shout be still .    therefore for Moab   my heart moan like a lyre ,   my inmost be for Kir - hareseth .     when Moab wear himself out on the high place ,   and enter his sanctuary to pray ,   it shall avail he nothing .       that be the word the   Lord   speak against Moab in time past .      but now the   Lord   speak : in three year , like the year of a hire laborer , the glory of Moab shall be empty despite all its great multitude ; and the remnant shall be very small and weak .
