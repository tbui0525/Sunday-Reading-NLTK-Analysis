b '   Water from the Rock .     from the wilderness of sin the whole israelite community journey by stage , as the   Lord   direct , and encamp at Rephidim .   but there be no water for the people to drink ,       and so they quarrel with Moses and say , give we water to drink . Moses reply to they , why do you quarrel with I ? why do you put the   Lord   to a test ?      here , then , in their thirst for water , the people grumble against Moses , say , why then do you bring we up out of Egypt ? to have we die of thirst with our child and our livestock ?      so Moses cry out to the   Lord , what shall I do with this people ? a little more and they will stone I !      the   Lord   answer Moses : go on ahead of the people , and take along with you some of the elder of Israel , hold in your hand , as you go , the staff with which you strike the Nile .      I will be stand there in front of you on the rock in Horeb . strike the rock , and the water will flow from it for the people to drink .    Moses do this , in the sight of the elder of Israel .      the place be name Massah and Meribah ,    because the Israelites quarrel there and test the   Lord , say , be the   Lord   in our midst or not ?     Battle with Amalek .     then Amalek    come and wage war against Israel in Rephidim .        so Moses say to Joshua , choose some man for we , and tomorrow go out and engage Amalek in battle . I will be stand on top of the hill with the staff of God in my hand .      Joshua do as Moses tell he : he engage Amalek in battle while Moses , Aaron , and Hur climb to the top of the hill .      as long as Moses keep his hand raise up , Israel have the well of the fight , but when he let his hand rest , Amalek have the well of the fight .      Moses hand , however , grow tired ; so they take a rock and put it under he and he sit on it . meanwhile Aaron and Hur support his hand , one on one side and one on the other , so that his hand remain steady until sunset .      and Joshua defeat Amalek and his people with the sword .     then the   Lord   say to Moses : write this down in a book as something to be remember , and recite it to Joshua :    I will completely blot out the memory of Amalek from under the heaven .      Moses build an altar there , which he name Yahweh - nissi ;        for he say , take up the banner of the   Lord !    the   Lord   have a war against Amalek through the age .             '
