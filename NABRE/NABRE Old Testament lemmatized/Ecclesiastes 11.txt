b '     send forth your bread upon the face of the water ;   after a long time you may find it again .   make seven , or even eight portion ;   you know not what misfortune may come upon the earth .    no one know what good will come    when the cloud be full ,   they pour out rain upon the earth . whether a tree fall to the south or to the north ,   wherever it fall , there shall it lie .   one who pay heed to the wind will never sow ,   and one who watch the cloud will never reap .   just as you do not know how the life breath   enter the human frame in the mother womb , so you do not know the work of God ,   who be work in everything .    in the morning sow your seed ,   and at evening do not let your hand be idle : for you do not know which of the two will be successful ,   or whether both alike will turn out well .    poem on Youth and Old Age .      light be sweet ! and it be pleasant for the eye to see the sun .      however many year mortal may live , let they , as they enjoy they all , remember that the day of darkness will be many . all that be to come be vanity .     rejoice , o youth , while you be young   and let your heart be glad in the day of your youth . follow the way of your heart ,   the vision of your eye ; yet understand regard all this   that God will bring you to judgment .   banish misery from your heart   and remove pain from your body ,   for youth and black hair be fleeting .
