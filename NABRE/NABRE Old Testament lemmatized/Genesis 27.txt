b '   Jacobs Deception .      when Isaac be so old that his eyesight have fail he , he call his old son Esau and say to he , my son ! here I be ! he reply .      Isaac then say , now I have grow old . I do not know when I might die .      so now take your hunting gear\xe2\x80\x94your quiver and bow\xe2\x80\x94and go out into the open country to hunt some game for I .      then prepare for I a dish in the way I like , and bring it to I to eat , so that I may bless you    before I die .     Rebekah have be listen while Isaac be speak to his son Esau . so when Esau go out into the open country to hunt some game for his father ,        Rebekah say to her son Jacob , listen ! I hear your father tell your brother Esau ,      bring I some game and prepare a dish for I to eat , that I may bless you with the   Lord s approval before I die .      now , my son , obey I in what I be about to order you .      go to the flock and get I two choice young goat so that with these I might prepare a dish for your father in the way he like .      then bring it to your father to eat , that he may bless you before he die .      but Jacob say to his mother Rebekah , but my brother Esau be a hairy man and I be smooth - skinned !        suppose my father feel I ? he will think I be make fun of he , and I will bring on myself a curse instead of a blessing .      his mother , however , reply : let any curse against you , my son , fall on I ! just obey I . go and get I the young goat .     so Jacob go and get they and bring they to his mother , and she prepare a dish in the way his father like .      Rebekah then take the good clothe of her old son Esau that she have in the house , and give they to her young son Jacob to wear ;      and with the goatskin she cover up his hand and the hairless part of his neck .      then she give her son Jacob the dish and the bread she have prepare .     go to his father , Jacob say , Father ! yes ? reply Isaac . which of my son be you ?      Jacob answer his father : I be Esau , your firstborn . I do as you tell I . please sit up and eat some of my game , so that you may bless I .      but Isaac say to his son , how do you get it so quickly , my son ? he answer , the   Lord , your God , direct I .      Isaac then say to Jacob , come close , my son , that I may feel you , to learn whether you really be my son Esau or not .      so Jacob move up close to his father . when Isaac feel he , he say , although the voice be Jacobs , the hand be Esaus .      ( he fail to identify he because his hand be hairy , like those of his brother Esau ; so he bless he . )      again Isaac say , be you really my son Esau ? and Jacob say , I be .      then Isaac say , serve I , my son , and let I eat of the game so that I may bless you . Jacob serve it to he , and Isaac eat ; he bring he wine , and he drink .      finally his father Isaac say to he , come close , my son , and kiss I .      as Jacob go up to kiss he , Isaac smell the fragrance of his clothe . with that , he bless he , say , ah , the fragrance of my son   be like the fragrance of a field   that the   Lord   have bless !    may God give to you   of the dew of the heaven and of the fertility of the earth   abundance of grain and wine .    may people serve you ,   and nation bow down to you ; be master of your brother ,   and may your mother son bow down to you . curse be those who curse you ,   and bless be those who bless you .     Jacob have scarcely leave his father after Isaac have finish bless he , when his brother Esau come back from his hunt .      then he too prepare a dish , and bring it to his father , he say , let my father sit up and eat some of his son game , that you may then give I your blessing .      his father Isaac ask he , who be you ? he say , I be your son , your firstborn son , Esau .      Isaac tremble greatly . who be it , then , he ask , that hunt game and bring it to I ? I eat it all just before you come , and I bless he . now he be bless !      as he hear his father word , Esau burst into loud , bitter sobbing and say , Father , bless I too !      when Isaac say , your brother come here by a ruse and carry off your blessing ,      Esau exclaim , he be well name Jacob , be he not ! he have supplant I    twice ! first he take away my right as firstborn , and now he have take away my blessing . then he say , have you not save a blessing for I ?        Isaac reply to Esau : I have already appoint he your master , and I have assign to he all his kindred as his servant ; besides , I have sustain he with grain and wine . what then can I do for you , my son ?      but Esau say to his father , have you only one blessing , father ? bless I too , father ! and Esau weep aloud .        his father Isaac say in response : see , far from the fertile earth   will be your dwelling ;   far from the dew of the heavens above !    by your sword you will live ,   and your brother you will serve ; but when you become restless ,   you will throw off his yoke from your neck .      Esau bear a grudge against Jacob because of the blessing his father have give he . Esau say to himself , let the time of mourning for my father come , so that I may kill my brother Jacob .        when Rebekah get news of what her old son Esau have in mind , she summon her young son Jacob and say to he : listen ! your brother Esau intend to get his revenge by kill you .      so now , my son , obey I : flee at once to my brother Laban in Haran ,      and stay with he a while until your brother fury subsides\xe2\x80\x94      until your brother anger against you subside and he forget what you do to he . then I will send for you and bring you back . why should I lose both of you in a single day ?    Jacob Sent to Laban .     Rebekah say to Isaac : I be disgusted with life because of the hittite woman . if Jacob also should marry a Hittite woman , a native of the land , like these woman , why should I live ?
