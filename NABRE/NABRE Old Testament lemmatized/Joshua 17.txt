b '   Manasseh .      now as for the lot that fall to the tribe of Manasseh    as the firstborn of Joseph : since Manassehs eld son , Machir , the father of Gilead , be a warrior , who have already obtain Gilead and Bashan ,      the allotment be now make to the rest of the Manassites by their clan : the descendant of Abiezer , Helek , Asriel , Shechem , Hepher , and Shemida ; these be the other male child of Manasseh , son of Joseph , by their clan .      furthermore , Zelophehad , son of Hepher , son of Gilead , son of Machir , son of Manasseh , have no son , but only daughter , whose name be Mahlah , Noah , Hoglah , Milcah , and Tirzah .      these present themselves to Eleazar the priest , to Joshua , son of Nun , and to the leader , say , the   Lord   command Moses to give we a heritage among our relative . so in accordance with the command of the   Lord   a heritage be give they among their father relative .      thus ten share fall to Manasseh apart from the land of Gilead and Bashan beyond the Jordan ,        since these female descendant of Manasseh receive each a portion among his son . the land of Gilead fall to the rest of the Manassites .     Manasseh border on Asher .    from Michmethath , near Shechem , another boundary run southward to include the inhabitant of En - Tappuah ,      because the district of Tappuah belong to Manasseh , although Tappuah itself be an Ephraimite city on the border of Manasseh .      this same boundary continue down to the Wadi Kanah .    the city that belong to Ephraim from among the city in Manasseh be those to the south of that wadi ; thus the territory of Manasseh run north of the wadi and end at the sea .      the land on the south belong to Ephraim and that on the north to Manasseh ; with the sea as their common boundary , they reach Asher on the north and Issachar on the east .      moreover , in Issachar and in Asher Manasseh be award Beth - shean and its town , Ibleam and its town , the inhabitant of Dor and its town , the inhabitant of Endor and its town , the inhabitant of Taanach and its town , the inhabitant of Megiddo and its town ( the third be Naphath - dor ) .      since the Manassites be not able to dispossess these city , the Canaanites continue to inhabit this region .      when the Israelites grow strong they put the Canaanites to force labor , but they do not dispossess they .    Protest of Joseph Tribes .     the descendant of Joseph say to Joshua , why have you give we only one lot and one share as our heritage ?    our people be too many , because of the extent to which the   Lord   have bless we .      Joshua answer they , if you be too many , go up to the forest and clear out a place for yourself there in the land of the Perizzites and Rephaim , since the mountain region of Ephraim be so narrow .      for the Josephites say , our mountain region be not enough for we ; on the other hand , the Canaanites live in the valley region all have iron chariot , in particular those in Beth - shean and its town , and those in the valley of Jezreel .      Joshua therefore say to Ephraim and Manasseh , the house of Joseph , you be a numerous people and very strong . you shall not have merely one share ,      for the mountain region which be now forest shall be yours when you clear it . its adjacent land shall also be your if , despite their strength and iron chariot , you dispossess the Canaanites .
