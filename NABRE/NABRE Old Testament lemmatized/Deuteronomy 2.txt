b '   Northward Along Edom .      then we turn and proceed into the wilderness on the Red Sea road ,    as the   Lord   have tell I , and circle around the highland of Seir for a long time .      finally the   Lord   say to I ,      you have wander round these highland long enough ; turn and go north .      command the people : you be now about to pass through the territory of your relative , the descendant of Esau , who live in Seir . though they be afraid of you , be very careful      not to come in conflict with they , for I will not give you so much as a foot of their land , since I have already give Esau possession of the highland of Seir .        you shall purchase from they with money the food you eat ; even the water you drink you shall buy from they with money .      surely , the   Lord , your God , have bless you in all your undertaking ; he have be concern    about your journey through this vast wilderness . it be now forty year that the   Lord , your God , have be with you , and you have lack nothing .        so we pass by our relative , the descendant of Esau who live in Seir , leave behind we the Arabah route , Elath , and Ezion - geber . along Moab .   then we turn and pass on toward the wilderness of Moab .       and the   Lord   say to I , do not show hostility to the Moabites or engage they in battle , for I will not give you possession of any of their land , since I have give Ar to the descendant of Lot as their possession .        ( formerly the Emim live there , a people great and numerous and as tall as the Anakim ;        like the Anakim they be consider Rephaim , though the Moabites call they Emim .        in Seir , however , the former inhabitant be the Horites ;    the descendant of Esau dispossess they , clear they out of the way and dwell in their place , just as Israel have do in the land of its possession which the   Lord   give it . )      now get ready to cross the Wadi Zered . so we cross the Wadi Zered .       now thirty - eight year have elapse between our departure from Kadesh - barnea and the crossing of the Wadi Zered ; in the meantime the whole generation of soldier have perish from the camp , as the   Lord   have swear they should .      indeed the   Lord s own hand be against they , to rout they from the camp completely .    along Ammon .      when at length death have put an end to all the soldier among the people ,      the   Lord   say to I ,      you be now about to leave Ar and the territory of Moab behind .      as you come opposite the Ammonites ,    do not show hostility or come in conflict with they , for I will not give you possession of any land of the Ammonites , since I have give it to the descendant of Lot as their possession .      ( this also be consider a country of the Rephaim ; formerly the Rephaim dwelt there . the Ammonites call they Zamzummim ,        a people great and numerous and as tall as the Anakim . but these , too , the   Lord   clear out of the way for the Ammonites , so that they dispossess they and dwelt in their place .        he do the same for the descendant of Esau , who live in Seir , by clear the Horites out of their way , so that they dispossess they and dwelt in their place down to the present .        as for the Avvim , who once live in village in the vicinity of Gaza ,    the Caphtorim , migrate from Caphtor , clear they away and dwelt in their place . )     Defeat of Sihon .      Advance now across the Wadi Arnon . I now deliver into your power Sihon , the Amorite king of Heshbon , and his land . begin to take possession ; engage he in battle .        this day I will begin to put a fear and dread of you into the people everywhere under heaven , so that at the mention of your name they will quake and tremble before you .     so I send messenger from the wilderness of Kedemoth to Sihon , king of Heshbon , with this offer of peace :      let I pass through your country . I will travel only on the road . I will not turn aside either to the right or to the left .      the food I eat you will sell I for money , and the water I drink , you will give I for money . only let I march through ,      as the descendant of Esau who dwell in Seir and the Moabites who dwell in Ar have do , until I cross the Jordan into the land the   Lord , our God , be about to give we .        but Sihon , king of Heshbon , refuse to let we pass through his land , because the   Lord , your God , make he stubborn in mind and obstinate in heart that he might deliver he into your power , as indeed he have now do .     then the   Lord   say to I , now that I have already begin to give over to you Sihon and his land , begin to take possession .      so Sihon and all his people advanced against we to join battle at Jahaz ;      but since the   Lord , our God , have give he over to we , we defeat he and his son and all his people .       at that time we capture all his city and put every city under the ban ,    man , woman and child ; we leave no survivor .      our only plunder be the livestock and the spoil of the capture city .      from Aroer on the edge of the Wadi Arnon and from the town in the wadi itself , as far as Gilead ,    no city be too well fortified for we . all of they the   Lord , our God , give over to we .      however , just as the   Lord , our God , command we , you do not encroach upon any of the ammonite land , neither the region border on the Wadi Jabbok , nor the city of the highland .
