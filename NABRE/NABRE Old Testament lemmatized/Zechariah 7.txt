b '   a question about fasting .     in the fourth year of Darius the king , the word of the   Lord   come to Zechariah , on the fourth day of the ninth month , Kislev .        Bethelsarezer send Regem - melech and his man to implore the favor of the   Lord       and to ask the priest of the house of the   Lord   of host , and the prophet , must I weep and abstain in the fifth month    as I have be do these many year ?      then the word of the   Lord   of host come to I :      say to all the people of the land and to the priest : when you fast and lament in the fifth and in the seventh month    these seventy year , be it really for I that you fast ?        when you be eat and drink , be it not for yourself that you eat and for yourself that you drink ?     be these not the word which the   Lord   proclaim through the early prophet ,    when Jerusalem and its surround city be inhabit and secure , when the Negeb and the Shephelah be inhabit ?      the word of the   Lord   come to Zechariah :      thus say the   Lord   of host : Judge with true justice , and show kindness and compassion toward each other .        do not oppress the widow or the orphan , the resident alien or the poor ;    do not plot evil against one another in your heart .        but they refuse to listen ; they stubbornly turn their back and stop their ear so as not to hear .        and they make their heart as hard as diamond    so as not to hear the instruction and the word that the   Lord   of host have send by his spirit through the early prophet . so great anger come from the   Lord   of host :      just as when I call out and they do not listen , so they will call out and I will not listen , say the   Lord   of host .      and I will scatter they among all the nation that they do not know .    so the land be leave desolate behind they with no one move about , and they make a pleasant land into a wasteland .
