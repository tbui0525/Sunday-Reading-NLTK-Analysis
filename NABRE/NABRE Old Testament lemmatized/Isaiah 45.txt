b '    thus say the   Lord   to his anoint ,    Cyrus ,   whose right hand I grasp , subdue nation before he ,   strip king of their strength , open door before he ,   leave the gate unbarred :   I will go before you   and level the mountain ; bronze door    I will shatter ,   iron bar I will snap .    I will give you treasure of darkness ,   rich hide away , that you may know I be the   Lord ,   the God of Israel , who call you by name .     for the sake of Jacob , my servant ,   of Israel my choose one , I have call you by name ,   give you a title , though you do not know I .    I be the   Lord , there be no other ,   there be no God besides I . it be I who arm you , though you do not know I ,    so that all may know , from the rise of the sun   to its setting , that there be none besides I .   I be the   Lord , there be no other .    I form the light , and create the darkness , I make weal and create woe ;    I , the   Lord , do all these thing .   let justice descend , you heavens , like dew from above ,   like gentle rain let the cloud drop it down . let the earth open and salvation bud forth ;   let righteousness spring up with they !    I , the   Lord , have create this .    Woe to anyone who contend with their maker ;    a potsherd among potsherd of the earth !   shall the clay say to the potter , what be you do ?   or , what you be make have no handle ?   Woe to anyone who ask a father , what be you beget ?   or a woman , what be you give birth to ?   thus say the   Lord ,   the Holy One of Israel , his maker : do you question I about my child ,   tell I how to treat the work of my hand ?   it be I who make the earth   and create the people upon it ; it be my hand that stretch out the heaven ;   I give the order to all their host .   it be I who stir he    up for justice ;   all his way I make level . he shall rebuild my city   and let my exile go free without price or payment ,   say the   Lord   of host .      thus say the   Lord : the earning of Egypt , the gain of Ethiopia ,   and the Sabeans ,    tall of stature , shall come over to you and belong to you ;   they shall follow you , come in chain . before you they shall bow down ,   say in prayer : with you alone be God ; and there be none other ,   no other god !    truly with you God be hide ,    the God of Israel , the savior !    they be put to shame and disgrace , all of they ;   they go in disgrace who carve image .   Israel have be save by the   Lord ,   save forever ! you shall never be put to shame or disgrace   in any future age .      for thus say the   Lord , the creator of the heavens ,   who be God , the designer and maker of the earth   who establish it , not as an empty waste    do he create it ,   but design it to be live in : I be the   Lord , and there be no other .    I have not speak in secret   from some place in the land of darkness , I have not say to the descendant of Jacob ,   look for I in an empty waste . I , the   Lord , promise justice ,   I declare what be right .     come and assemble , gather together ,   you fugitive from among the nation ! they be without knowledge who bear wooden idol    and pray to god that can not save .   come close and declare ;   let they take counsel together : who announce this from the beginning ,   declare it from of old ? be it not I , the   Lord ,   besides whom there be no other God ?   there be no just and save God but I .     turn to I and be safe ,   all you end of the earth ,   for I be God ; there be no other !   by myself I swear ,   utter my just decree ,   a word that will not return : to I every knee shall bend ;   by I every tongue shall swear ,    say , only in the   Lord   be just deed and power . before he in shame shall come   all who vent their anger against he .   in the   Lord   all the descendant of Israel   shall have vindication and glory .
