b '   Jobs Seventh Reply .     then Job answer and say :     today especially my complaint be bitter ,   his hand be heavy upon I in my groaning .   would that I know how to find he ,   that I might come to his dwelling !   I would set out my case before he ,   fill my mouth with argument ;   I would learn the word he would answer I ,   understand what he would say to I .   would he contend against I with his great power ?   no , he himself would heed I !   there an upright man might argue with he ,   and I would once and for all be deliver from my judge .   but if I go east , he be not there ;    or west , I can not perceive he ;   the north enfold he , and I can not catch sight of he ;   the south hide he , and I can not see he .   yet he know my way ;   if he test I , I should come forth like gold .    my foot have always walk in his step ;   I have keep his way and not turn aside .   from the command of his lip I have not depart ;   the word of his mouth I have treasure in my heart .   but once he decide , who can contradict he ?   what he desire , that he do .    for he will carry out what be appoint for I ,   and many such thing he have in store .   therefore I be terrify before he ;   when I take think , I dread he .   for it be God who have make my heart faint ,   the Almighty who have terrify I .   yes , would that I have vanish in darkness ,   hide by the thick gloom before I .
