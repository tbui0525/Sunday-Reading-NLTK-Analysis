b '     some time afterward , Joseph be inform , your father be fail . so he take along with he his two son , Manasseh and Ephraim .      when Jacob be tell , your son Joseph have come to you , Israel rally his strength and sit up in bed .      Jacob then say to Joseph : God Almighty appear to I at Luz    in the land of Canaan , and bless I ,      he say , I will make you fertile and multiply you and make you into an assembly of people , and I will give this land to your descendant after you as a permanent possession .      so now your two son who be bear to you in the land of Egypt before I join you here , shall be mine ; Ephraim and Manasseh shall be mine as much as Reuben and Simeon be mine .      Progeny bear to you after they shall remain yours ; but their heritage shall be record in the name of their brother .       I do this because , when I be return from Paddan , your mother Rachel die , to my sorrow , during the journey in Canaan , while we be still a short distance from Ephrath ; and I bury she there on the way to Ephrath [ now Bethlehem ] .      when Israel see Josephs son , he ask , who be these ?      they be my son , Joseph answer his father , whom God have give I here . bring they to I , say his father , that I may bless they .      now Israels eye be dim from age ; he could not see well . when Joseph bring his son close to he , he kiss and embrace they .      then Israel say to Joseph , I never expect to see your face again , and now God have allow I to see your descendant as well !     Joseph remove they from his father knee and bow down before he with his face to the ground .      then Joseph take the two , Ephraim with his right hand , to Israels leave , and Manasseh with his left hand , to Israels right , and bring they up to he .      but Israel , cross his hand , put out his right hand and lay it on the head of Ephraim , although he be the young , and his left hand on the head of Manasseh , although he be the firstborn .      then he bless they with these word : may the God in whose presence   my father Abraham and Isaac walk , the God who have be my shepherd   from my birth to this day ,    the angel who have deliver I from all harm ,   bless these boy that in they my name be recall ,   and the name of my father , Abraham and Isaac , and they may become teem multitude   upon the earth !     when Joseph see that his father have lay his right hand on Ephraims head , this seem wrong to he ; so he take hold of his father hand , to remove it from Ephraims head to Manassehs ,      say , that be not right , father ; the other one be the firstborn ; lie your right hand on his head !      but his father refuse . I know it , son , he say , I know . that one too shall become a people , and he too shall be great . nevertheless , his young brother shall surpass he , and his descendant shall become a multitude of nation .      so he bless they that day and say , by you shall the people of Israel pronounce blessing , say , God make you like Ephraim and Manasseh . thus he place Ephraim before Manasseh .      then Israel say to Joseph : I be about to die . but God will be with you and will restore you to the land of your ancestor .       as for I , I give to you , as to the one above his brother , Shechem , which I capture from the Amorites with my sword and bow .
