b ' Gods Fidelity to the promise I   give thank to the   Lord , invoke his name ;    make know among the people his deed !    sing praise to he , play music ;   proclaim all his wondrous deed !   glory in his holy name ;   let heart that seek the   Lord   rejoice !   seek out the   Lord   and his might ;   constantly seek his face .    recall the wondrous deed he have do ,   his wonder and word of judgment ,   you descendant of Abraham his servant ,   offspring of Jacob the choose one !    II   he the   Lord , be our God   whose judgment reach through all the earth .   he remember forever his covenant ,   the word he command for a thousand generation ,   which he make with Abraham ,   and swear to Isaac ,    and ratify in a statute for Jacob ,   an everlasting covenant for Israel :   to you I give the land of Canaan ,   your own allot inheritance .     III   when they be few in number ,    a handful , and stranger there ,   wander from nation to nation ,   from one kingdom to another people ,   he let no one oppress they ;   for their sake he rebuke king :     do not touch my anoint one ,   to my prophet do no harm .    IV   then he call down a famine on the land ,   destroy the grain that sustain they .     he have send a man ahead of they ,   Joseph , sell as a slave .    they shackle his foot with chain ;   collar his neck in iron ,    till his prediction come to pass ,   and the word of the   Lord   prove he true .    the king send and release he ;   the ruler of people set he free .    he make he lord over his household ,   ruler over all his possession ,    to instruct his prince as he desire ,   to teach his elder wisdom .    v   then Israel enter Egypt ;    Jacob sojourn in the land of Ham .    God greatly increase his people ,   make they more numerous than their foe .    he turn their heart to hate his people ,   to treat his servant deceitfully .    he send his servant Moses ,   and Aaron whom he have choose .     they work his sign in Egypt    and wonder in the land of Ham .   he send darkness and it grow dark ,   but they rebel against his word .   he turn their water into blood   and kill their fish .   their land swarm with frog ,   even the chamber of their king .   he speak and there come swarm of fly ,   gnat through all their country .   for rain he give they hail ,   flash of lightning throughout their land .   he strike down their vine and fig tree ,   shatter the tree of their country .   he speak and the locust come ,   grasshopper without number .    they devour every plant in the land ;   they devour the crop of their field .   he strike down every firstborn in the land ,   the first fruit of all their vigor .   he bring his people out ,   laden with silver and gold ;    no one among the tribe stumble .   Egypt rejoice when they leave ,   for fear have seize they .    VI   he spread a cloud out as a cover ,   and make a fire to light up the night .    they ask and he bring they quail ;   with bread from heaven he fill they .    he split the rock and water gush forth ;   it flow through the desert like a river .    for he remember his sacred promise   to Abraham his servant .   he bring his people out with joy ,   his choose one with shout of triumph .   he give they the land of the nation ,   they take possession of the wealth of the people ,    that they might keep his statute   and observe his teaching .   Hallelujah !             '
