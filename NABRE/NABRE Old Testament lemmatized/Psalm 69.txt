b ' a Cry of Anguish in Great Distress   for the leader ; accord to lily .    of David .    I   save I , God ,   for the water    have reach my neck .    I have sink into the mire of the deep ,   where there be no foothold . I have go down to the watery depth ;   the flood overwhelm I .    I be weary with cry out ;   my throat be parch . my eye fail ,   from look for my God .    more numerous than the hair of my head   be those who hate I without cause .   those who would destroy I be mighty ,   my enemy without reason . must I now restore   what I do not steal ?     II   God , you know my folly ;   my fault be not hide from you .   let those who wait in hope for you ,   Lord   of host ,   not be shame because of I . let those who seek you , God of Israel ,    not be disgrace because of I .   for it be on your account I bear insult ,   that disgrace cover my face .    I have become an outcast to my kindred ,   a stranger to my mother child .    because zeal for your house have consume I ,    I be scorn by those who scorn you .    when I humble my spirit with fasting ,    this lead only to scorn .   when I clothe myself in sackcloth ;   I become a byword for they .   those who sit in the gate gossip about I ;   drunkard make I the butt of song .    III   but I will pray to you ,   Lord ,   at a favorable time . God , in your abundant kindness , answer I   with your sure deliverance .    rescue I from the mire ,    and do not let I sink . rescue I from those who hate I   and from the watery depth .   do not let the flood water overwhelm I ,   nor the deep swallow I ,   nor the pit close its mouth over I .   answer I ,   Lord , in your generous love ;   in your great mercy turn to I .   do not hide your face from your servant ;   hasten to answer I , for I be in distress .    come and redeem my life ;   because of my enemy ransom I .   you know my reproach , my shame , my disgrace ;   before you stand all my foe .   Insult have break my heart , and I despair ;   I look for compassion , but there be none ,    for comforter , but find none .   instead they give I poison for my food ;   and for my thirst they give I vinegar .     IV   may their own table be a snare for they ,   and their communion offering a trap .    make their eye so dim they can not see ;   keep their back ever feeble .   pour out your wrath upon they ;   let the fury of your anger overtake they .   make their camp desolate ,   with none to dwell in their tent .    for they pursue the one you strike ,   add to the pain of the one you wound .   Heap punishment upon their punishment ;   let they gain from you no vindication .   may they be blot from the book of life ;   not register among the just !     v   but here I be miserable and in pain ;   let your saving help protect I , God ,    that I may praise Gods name in song   and glorify it with thanksgiving .   that will please the   Lord   more than oxen ,   more than bull with horn and hoof :    see , you lowly one , and be glad ;   you who seek God , take heart !    for the   Lord   hear the poor ,   and do not spurn those in bondage .   let the heaven and the earth praise he ,   the sea and whatever move in they !    VI   for God will rescue Zion ,   and rebuild the city of Judah .   they will dwell there and possess it ;   the descendant of Gods servant will inherit it ;   those who love Gods name will dwell in it .
