b '   Song of Thanksgiving .      David proclaim the word of this song to the   Lord   when the   Lord   have rescue he from the grasp of all his enemy and from the grasp of Saul .        he say :   O   Lord , my rock , my fortress , my deliverer ,    my God , my rock of refuge ! my shield , my saving horn ,    my stronghold , my refuge ,   my savior , from violence you keep I safe .    praise be the   Lord , I exclaim !   I have be deliver from my enemy .     the breaker of death surge round about I ,   the menacing flood    terrify I ;   the cord of Sheol tighten ;   the snare of death lie in wait for I .   in my distress I call out :   Lord !   I cry out to my God ; from his temple    he hear my voice ,   my cry reach his ear .     the earth rock and shake ;    the foundation of the heavens tremble ;   they shake as his wrath flare up .   smoke rise in his nostril ,   a devour fire from his mouth ;   it kindle coal into flame .   he part the heaven and come down ,   a dark cloud under his foot .    mount on a cherub    he fly ,   bear along on the wing of the wind .    he make darkness the cover about he ,   a mass of water , heavy thunderhead .   from the brightness of his presence   coal be kindle to flame .   the   Lord   thunder from heaven ;   the most High make his voice resound .   he let fly arrow and scatter they ;   lightning , and disperse they .    then the bed of the sea appear ;   the world foundation lay bare , at the roar of the   Lord ,   at the storming breath of his nostril .    he reach down from on high and seize I ,   draw I out of the deep water .    he rescue I from my mighty enemy ,   from foe too powerful for I .   they attack I on a day of distress ,   but the   Lord   come to my support .   he set I free in the open ;   he rescue I because he love I .     the   Lord   acknowledge my righteousness ;   reward my clean hand .   for I keep the way of the   Lord ;   I be not disloyal to my God .   his law be all before I ,   his decree I do not cast aside .   I be honest toward he ;   I be on guard against sin .   so the   Lord   reward my righteousness ,   the cleanness of my hand in his sight .    toward the faithful you be faithful ;    to the honest you be honest ;   toward the sincere you be sincere ;   but to the perverse you be devious .   humble people you save ,   though on the haughty your eye look down .   you be my lamp , o   Lord !   my God brighten the darkness about I .   with you I can rush an armed band ,   with my God to help I can leap a wall .   Gods way be unerre ;   the   Lord s promise be try and true ;   he be a shield for all who trust in he .      truly , who be God except the   Lord ?   who but our God be the rock ?   this God who gird I with might ,   keep my way unerre ,   who make my foot swift as a deer ,   set I safe on the height ,    who train my hand for war ,   my arm to bend even a bow of bronze .     you have give I your protect shield ,   and your help have make I great .   you give I room to stride ;   my foot never stumble .   I pursue my enemy and overtake they ;   I do not turn back till I destroy they .   I strike they down , and they do not rise ;   they fall dead at my foot .   you gird I with strength for war ;   subdue adversary at my foot .   my foe you put to flight before I ;   those who hate I I destroy .   they cry for help , but no one save they ,   cry to the   Lord   but get no answer .   I grind they fine as the dust of the earth ;   like mud in the street I trod they down .   you rescue I from the strife of my people ;   you make I head over nation . a people I have not know become my slave ;   foreigner cringe before I ;   as soon as they hear of I they obey .   their courage fail ;   they came tremble from their fortress .   the   Lord   live ! bless be my rock !   exalted be God , the rock of my salvation .   o God who grant I vindication ,   subdue people under I ,    and help I escape from my enemy , truly you have exalt I above my adversary ,   from the violent you have rescue I .   thus I will proclaim you ,   Lord , among the nation ;   I will sing the praise of your name .    you have give great victory to your king ,   and show kindness to your anoint ,   to David and his posterity forever .
