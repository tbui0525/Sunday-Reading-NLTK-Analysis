b ' God of the Universe I   sing to the   Lord   a new song ;    sing to the   Lord , all the earth .   sing to the   Lord , bless his name ;   proclaim his salvation day after day .   tell his glory among the nation ;   among all people , his marvelous deed .     II    for great be the   Lord   and highly to be praise ,   to be fear above all god .    for the god of the nation be idol ,   but the   Lord   make the heavens .    Splendor and power go before he ;   power and grandeur be in his holy place .    III   give to the   Lord , you family of nation ,   give to the   Lord   glory and might ;    give to the   Lord   the glory due his name !   bring gift and enter his court ;    bow down to the   Lord , splendid in holiness . tremble before he , all the earth ;     declare among the nation : the   Lord   be king . the world will surely stand fast , never to be shake .   he rule the people with fairness .    IV   let the heaven be glad and the earth rejoice ;   let the sea and what fill it resound ;     let the plain be joyful and all that be in they . then let all the tree of the forest rejoice    before the   Lord   who come ,   who come to govern the earth ,   to govern the world with justice   and the people with faithfulness .
