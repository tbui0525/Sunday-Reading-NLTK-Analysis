b '   praise of Wisdom   Wisdom sing her own praise ,    among her own people she proclaim her glory .   in the assembly of the most high she open her mouth ,   in the presence of his host she tell of her glory :     from the mouth of the most high I come forth ,    and cover the earth like a mist .   in the height of heaven I dwelt ,   and my throne be in a pillar of cloud .   the vault of heaven I compass alone ,   and walk through the deep abyss .   over wave of the sea , over all the land ,   over every people and nation I hold sway .   among all these I seek a rest place .   in whose inheritance should I abide ?     then the Creator of all give I his command ,   and my Creator choose the spot for my tent . he say , in Jacob make your dwelling ,   in Israel your inheritance .   before all age , from the beginning , he create I ,   and through all age I shall not cease to be .   in the holy tent I minister before he ,   and so I be establish in Zion .   in the city he love as he love I , he give I rest ;   in Jerusalem , my domain .   I strike root among the glorious people ,   in the portion of the Lord , his heritage .     like a cedar in Lebanon I grow tall ,   like a cypress on Mount Hermon ;   I grow tall like a palm tree in Engedi ,   like rosebush in Jericho ; like a fair olive tree in the field ,   like a plane tree beside water I grow tall .   like cinnamon and fragrant cane ,   like precious myrrh I give forth perfume ; like galbanum and onycha and mastic ,    like the odor of incense in the holy tent .      I spread out my branch like a terebinth ,   my branch so glorious and so graceful .   I bud forth delight like a vine ;   my blossom be glorious and rich fruit .    come to I , all who desire I ,   and be fill with my fruit .    you will remember I as sweet than honey ,   well to have than the honeycomb .   those who eat of I will hunger still ,    those who drink of I will thirst for more .    whoever obey I will not be put to shame ,   and those who serve I will never go astray .     all this be the book of the covenant of the most high God ,    the Law which Moses command we    as a heritage for the community of Jacob .    it overflow , like the Pishon , with wisdom ,    and like the Tigris at the time of first fruit .   it run over , like the Euphrates , with understanding ,   and like the Jordan at harvest time .   it flood like the Nile with instruction ,   like the Gihon    at vintage time .   the first human be never finish comprehend wisdom ,   nor will the last succeed in fathom she .   for deep than the sea be her thought ,   and her counsel , than the great abyss .     now I , like a stream from a river ,    and like water channel into a garden\xe2\x80\x94   I say , I will water my plant ,   I will drench my flower bed . then suddenly this stream of mine become a river ,   and this river of mine become a sea .   again I will make my teaching shine forth like the dawn ;   I will spread their brightness afar off .   again I will pour out instruction like prophecy   and bestow it on generation yet to come .
