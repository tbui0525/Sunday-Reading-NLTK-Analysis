b ' the Ideal davidic King    but a shoot shall sprout from the stump    of Jesse ,   and from his root a bud shall blossom .     the spirit of the   Lord   shall rest upon he :    a spirit of wisdom and of understanding , a spirit of counsel and of strength ,   a spirit of knowledge and of fear of the   Lord ,    and his delight shall be the fear of the   Lord . not by appearance shall he judge ,   nor by hearsay shall he decide ,   but he shall judge the poor with justice ,   and decide fairly for the land afflict .   he shall strike the ruthless with the rod of his mouth ,   and with the breath of his lip he shall slay the wicked .    Justice shall be the band around his waist ,   and faithfulness a belt upon his hip .     then the wolf shall be a guest of the lamb ,   and the leopard shall lie down with the young goat ; the calf and the young lion shall browse together ,   with a little child to guide they .    the cow and the bear shall graze ,   together their young shall lie down ;   the lion shall eat hay like the ox .    the baby shall play by the viper den ,   and the child lie his hand on the adder lair .   they shall not harm or destroy on all my holy mountain ;   for the earth shall be fill with knowledge of the   Lord ,   as water cover the sea .    restoration     on that day , the root of Jesse ,   set up as a signal for the peoples\xe2\x80\x94 he the nation will seek out ;   his dwelling shall be glorious .     on that day , the Lord shall again take it in hand   to reclaim the remnant of his people   that be leave from Assyria and Egypt , Pathros , Ethiopia , and Elam ,   Shinar , Hamath , and the isle of the sea .    he shall raise a signal to the nation    and gather the outcast of Israel ; the disperse of Judah he shall assemble   from the four corner of the earth .   the envy of Ephraim shall pass away ,   and those hostile to Judah shall be cut off ; Ephraim shall not envy Judah ,   and Judah shall not be hostile to Ephraim ;   but they shall swoop down on the foothill   of the Philistines to the west ,   together they shall plunder the people of the east ;   Edom and Moab shall be their possession ,   and the Ammonites their subject .   the   Lord   shall dry up the tongue    of the Sea of Egypt ,   and wave his hand over the Euphrates with his fierce wind , and divide it into seven streamlet ,   so that it can be cross in sandal .    there shall be a highway for the remnant of his people   that be leave from Assyria , as there be for Israel   when it come up from the land of Egypt .
