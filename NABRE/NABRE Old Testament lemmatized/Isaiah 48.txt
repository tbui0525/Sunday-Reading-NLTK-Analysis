b '   exhortation to the Exiles   hear this , house of Jacob   call by the name Israel ,   spring from the stock of Judah , you who swear by the name of the   Lord   and invoke the God of Israel   without sincerity , without justice ,   though you be name after the holy city   and rely on the God of Israel ,   whose name be the   Lord   of host .   thing of the past I declare long ago ,   they go forth from my mouth , I announce they ;   then suddenly I take action and they come to be .   because I know that you be stubborn   and that your neck be an iron sinew   and your forehead bronze ,   I declare they to you of old ;   before they take place I inform you , that you might not say , my idol do they ,   my statue , my molten image command they .   now that you have hear , look at all this ;   must you not admit it ?   from now on I announce new thing to you ,   hide event you never know .   now , not from of old , they be create ,   before today you do not hear of they ,   so that you can not claim , I have know they .   you never hear , you never know ,   they never reach your ear beforehand . yes , I know you be utterly treacherous ,   a rebel you be name from the womb .    for the sake of my name I restrain my anger ,   for the sake of my renown I hold it back from you ,   lest I destroy you .   see , I refine you , but not like silver ;   I test you in the furnace of affliction .    for my sake , for my own sake , I do this ;   why should my name be profane ?   my glory I will not give to another .     listen to I , Jacob ,   Israel , whom I call ! I , it be I who be the first ,   and be I the last .    yes , my hand lay the foundation of the earth ;   my right hand spread out the heaven . when I summon they ,   they stand forth at once .      all of you assemble and listen :   who among you declare these thing ? the one the   Lord   love    shall do his will   against Babylon and the offspring of Chaldea .   I myself have speak , I have summon he ,   I have bring he , and his way succeed !   come near to I and hear this !   from the beginning I do not speak in secret ; at the time it happen , I be there :   now the Lord   God   have send I , and his spirit .      thus say the   Lord , your redeemer ,   the Holy One of Israel : I be the   Lord , your God ,   teach you how to prevail ,   lead you on the way you should go .   if only you would attend to my commandment ,   your peace would be like a river ,   your vindication like the wave of the sea ,   your descendant like the sand ,   the offspring of your loin like its grain , their name never cut off   or blot out from my presence .   go forth from Babylon , flee from Chaldea !   with shout of joy declare this , announce it ; make it known to the end of the earth ,   say : the   Lord   have redeem his servant Jacob .   they do not thirst   when he lead they through dry land ; water from the rock he set flow for they ;   he cleave the rock , and water well forth .      there be no peace    for the wicked ,   say the   Lord .
