b ' God be a mighty King   the   Lord   be king ,    robe with majesty ;   the   Lord   be robe , gird with might .   the world will surely stand in place ,   never to be move .    your throne stand firm from of old ;   you be from everlaste .     the flood have raise up ,   Lord ;   the flood have raise up its roar ;   the flood have raise its pound wave .   more powerful than the roar of many water ,   more powerful than the breaker of the sea ,   powerful in the heavens be the   Lord .   your decree be firmly establish ;   holiness befit your house ,   Lord ,   for all the length of day .
