b ' prayer for Divine help   for the leader ; with wind instrument . a psalm of David .    I   give ear to my word , o   Lord ;   understand my sighing .    attend to the sound of my cry ,   my king and my God ! for to you I will pray ,   Lord ;    in the morning you will hear my voice ;   in the morning I will plead before you and wait .     II   you be not a god who delight in evil ;   no wicked person find refuge with you ;    the arrogant can not stand before your eye . you hate all who do evil ;    you destroy those who speak falsely .   a bloody and fraudulent man   the   Lord   abhor .    III   but I , through the abundance of your mercy ,    will enter into your house . I will bow down toward your holy sanctuary   out of fear of you .    Lord , guide I in your justice because of my foe ;   make straight your way before I .     IV   for there be no sincerity in their mouth ;   their heart be corrupt . their throat    be an open grave ;    on their tongue be subtle lie .   declare they guilty , God ;   make they fall by their own device .   drive they out for their many sin ;   for they have rebel against you .    v   then all who trust in you will be glad   and forever shout for joy .   you will protect they and those will rejoice in you   who love your name .   for you ,   Lord , bless the just one ;   you surround he with favor like a shield .
