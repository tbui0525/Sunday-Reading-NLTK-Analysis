b '   praise of Moses , Aaron , and Phinehas   from he come the man    who would win the favor of all the living :   Dear to God and human being ,   Moses , whose memory be a blessing .   God make he like the angel in honor ,   and strengthen he with fearful power .    at his word God perform sign   and sustain he in the king presence . he give he the commandment for his people ,   and reveal to he his glory .    because of his trustworthiness and meekness   God select he from all flesh ;    he let he hear his voice ,   and lead he into the cloud , where he hand over the commandment ,   the law of life and understanding ,   that he might teach his precept to Jacob ,   his judgment and decree to Israel .     he also raise up , like Moses in holiness ,    his brother   Aaron , of the tribe of Levi .    he make his office perpetual   and bestow on he priesthood for his people ; he establish he in honor   and crown he with lofty majesty .   he clothe he in splendid garment ,   and adorn he with glorious vestment : breech , tunic , and robe    with pomegranate at the hem and a rustle of bell round about ,   whose pleasing sound at each step would make he hear within the sanctuary ,   a reminder for the people ;   the sacred vestment of gold , violet ,   and crimson , work with embroidery ; the breastpiece for decision , the ephod and cincture    with scarlet yarn , the work of the weaver ; precious stone with seal engraving   in golden setting , the work of the jeweler , to commemorate in incised letter   each of the tribe of Israel ;   on his turban a diadem of gold ,   its plate engrave with the sacred inscription\xe2\x80\x94 Majestic , glorious , renowne for splendor ,   a delight to the eye , supremely beautiful .   before he , no one have be adorn with these ,   nor may they ever be wear by any other except his son and they alone ,   generation after generation , for all time .   his grain offering be wholly burn   as an establish offering twice each day ;   for Moses ordain he   and anoint he with the holy oil , in a last covenant with he and his family ,   as permanent as the heaven , that he should serve God in the priesthood   and bless the people in his name .   he choose he from all the living   to sacrifice burn offering and choice portion , to burn incense , sweet odor as a memorial ,   and to atone for the people of Israel .   he give to he the law ,   and authority to prescribe and to judge : to teach precept to the people ,   and judgment to the Israelites .   stranger rise in anger against he ,   grow jealous of he in the desert\xe2\x80\x94 the follower of Dathan and Abiram ,   and the band of Korah in their defiance .    when the   Lord   see this he become angry ,   and destroy they in his burn wrath . he bring against they a marvel ,   and consume they in flame fire .   then he increase the glory of Aaron    and bestow upon he his inheritance : the sacred offering he allot to he ,   with the showbread    as his portion ;   the oblation of the   Lord   be his food ,   a gift to he and his descendant .   but he hold no land among the people   nor share with they their heritage ; for the   Lord   himself be his portion and inheritance   among the Israelites .     Phinehas   too , the son of Eleazar ,   be the courageous third of his line when , zealous for the God of all ,   he meet the crisis of his people   and , at the prompting of his noble heart ,   atone for the child of Israel .   therefore , on he also God confer the right ,   in a covenant of friendship , to provide for the sanctuary , so that he and his descendant   should possess the high priesthood forever .   for even his covenant with David ,   the son of Jesse of the tribe of Judah , be an individual heritage through one son alone ;    but the heritage of Aaron be for all his descendant .    so now bless    the   Lord   who have crown you with glory !   may he grant you wisdom of heart   to govern his people in justice , lest the benefit you confer should be forget ,   or your authority , throughout all time .
