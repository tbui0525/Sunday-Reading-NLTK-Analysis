b '   Pharaohs Dream .      after a lapse of two year , Pharaoh have a dream . he be stand by the Nile ,      when up out of the Nile come seven cow , fine - look and fat ; they graze in the reed grass .      behind they seven other cow , poor - look and gaunt , come up out of the Nile ; and stand on the bank of the Nile beside the other ,      the poor - look , gaunt cow devour the seven fine - look , fat cow . then Pharaoh wake up .     he fall asleep again and have another dream . he see seven ear of grain , fat and healthy , grow on a single stalk .      behind they sprout seven ear of grain , thin and scorch by the east wind ;      and the thin ear swallow up the seven fat , healthy ear . then Pharaoh wake up\xe2\x80\x94it be a dream !     next morning his mind be agitate . so Pharaoh have all the magician    and sage of Egypt summon and recount his dream to they ; but there be no one to interpret it for he .      then the chief cupbearer say to Pharaoh : now I remember my negligence !      once , when Pharaoh be angry with his servant , he put I and the chief baker in custody in the house of the chief steward .      later , we both have dream on the same night , and each of our dream have its own meaning .      there be a hebrew youth with we , a slave of the chief steward ; and when we tell he our dream , he interpret they for we and explain for each of we the meaning of his dream .        thing turn out just as he have tell we : I be restore to my post , but the other man be impale .     Pharaoh therefore have Joseph summon , and they hurriedly bring he from the dungeon . after he shave and change his clothe , he come to Pharaoh .        Pharaoh then say to Joseph : I have a dream but there be no one to interpret it . but I hear it say of you , if he hear a dream he can interpret it .      it be not I , Joseph reply to Pharaoh , but God who will respond for the well - being of Pharaoh .      then Pharaoh say to Joseph : in my dream , I be stand on the bank of the Nile ,      when up from the Nile come seven cow , fat and well - form ; they graze in the reed grass .      behind they come seven other cow , scrawny , most ill - form and gaunt . never have I see such bad specimen as these in all the land of Egypt !      the gaunt , bad cow devour the first seven fat cow .      but when they have consume they , no one could tell that they have do so , because they look as bad as before . then I wake up .      in another dream I see seven ear of grain , full and healthy , grow on a single stalk .      behind they sprout seven ear of grain , shrivel and thin and scorch by the east wind ;      and the seven thin ear swallow up the seven healthy ear . I have speak to the magician , but there be no one to explain it to I .     Joseph say to Pharaoh : pharaohs dream have the same meaning . God have make known to Pharaoh what he be about to do .      the seven healthy cow be seven year , and the seven healthy ear be seven years\xe2\x80\x94the same in each dream .      the seven thin , bad cow that come up after they be seven year , as be the seven thin ear scorch by the east wind ; they be seven year of famine .      thing be just as I tell Pharaoh : God have reveal to Pharaoh what he be about to do .      seven year of great abundance be now come throughout the land of Egypt ;      but seven year of famine will rise up after they , when all the abundance will be forget in the land of Egypt . when the famine have exhaust the land ,      no trace of the abundance will be find in the land because of the famine that follow it , for it will be very severe .      that Pharaoh have the same dream twice mean that the matter have be confirm by God and that God will soon bring it about .     therefore , let Pharaoh seek out a discerning and wise man and put he in charge of the land of Egypt .      let Pharaoh act and appoint overseer for the land to organize it during the seven year of abundance .      they should collect all the food of these come good year , gather the grain under Pharaohs authority , for food in the city , and they should guard it .      this food will serve as a reserve for the country against the seven year of famine that will occur in the land of Egypt , so that the land may not perish in the famine .     this advice please Pharaoh and all his servant .        could we find another like he , Pharaoh ask his servant , a man so endowed with the spirit of God ?      so Pharaoh say to Joseph : since God have make all this know to you , there be no one as discerning and wise as you be .      you shall be in charge of my household , and all my people will obey your command . only in respect to the throne will I outrank you .        then Pharaoh say to Joseph , look , I put you in charge of the whole land of Egypt .      with that , Pharaoh take off his signet ring    and put it on Josephs finger . he dress he in robe of fine linen and put a gold chain around his neck .      he then have he ride in his second chariot , and they shout Abrek !    before he . thus be Joseph instal over the whole land of Egypt .      I be Pharaoh , he tell Joseph , but without your approval no one shall lift hand or foot in all the land of Egypt .      Pharaoh also bestow the name of Zaphenath - paneah    on Joseph , and he give he in marriage Asenath , the daughter of Potiphera , priest of Heliopolis . and Joseph go out over the land of Egypt .      Joseph be thirty year old when he enter the service of Pharaoh , king of Egypt . after Joseph leave Pharaoh , he go throughout the land of Egypt .      during the seven year of plenty , when the land produce abundant crop ,      he collect all the food of these year of plenty that the land of Egypt be enjoy and store it in the city , place in each city the crop of the field around it .      Joseph collect grain like the sand of the sea , so much that at last he stop measure it , for it be beyond measure .     before the famine year set in , Joseph become the father of two son , bear to he by Asenath , daughter of Potiphera , priest of Heliopolis .        Joseph name his firstborn Manasseh ,    meaning , God have make I forget entirely my trouble and my father house ;      and the second he name Ephraim ,    meaning , God have make I fruitful in the land of my affliction .     when the seven year of abundance enjoy by the land of Egypt come to an end ,      the seven year of famine set in , just as Joseph have say . although there be famine in all the other country , food be available throughout the land of Egypt .        when all the land of Egypt become hungry and the people cry to Pharaoh for food , Pharaoh say to all the Egyptians : go to Joseph and do whatever he tell you .      when the famine have spread throughout the land , Joseph open all the city that have grain and ration it to the Egyptians , since the famine have grip the land of Egypt .      indeed , the whole world come to Egypt to Joseph to buy grain , for famine have grip the whole world .
