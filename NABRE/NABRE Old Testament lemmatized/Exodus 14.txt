b '    then the   Lord   speak to Moses :      speak to the Israelites : let they turn about and camp before Pi - hahiroth , between Migdol and the sea .    Camp in front of Baal - zephon ,    just opposite , by the sea .      Pharaoh will then say , the Israelites be wander about aimlessly in the land . the wilderness have close in on they .      I will so harden Pharaohs heart that he will pursue they . thus I will receive glory through Pharaoh and all his army , and the Egyptians will know that I be the   Lord . this the Israelites do .       when it be report to the king of Egypt that the people have flee , Pharaoh and his servant have a change of heart about the people . what in the world have we do ! they say . we have release Israel from our service !      so Pharaoh harness his chariot and take his army with he .      he take six hundred select chariot and all the chariot of Egypt , with officer    on all of they .      the   Lord   harden the heart of Pharaoh , king of Egypt , so that he pursue the Israelites while they be go out in triumph .      the Egyptians pursue them\xe2\x80\x94all Pharaohs horse , his chariot , his horseman ,    and his army\xe2\x80\x94and catch up with they as they lie encamped by the sea , at Pi - hahiroth , in front of Baal - zephon .    cross the Red Sea .     now Pharaoh be near when the Israelites look up and see that the Egyptians have set out after they . greatly frightened , the Israelites cry out to the   Lord .      to Moses they say , be there no burial place in Egypt that you bring we to die in the wilderness ? what have you do to we , bring we out of Egypt ?      do we not tell you this in Egypt , when we say , leave we alone that we may serve the Egyptians ? far well for we to serve the Egyptians than to die in the wilderness .      but Moses answer the people , do not fear ! stand your ground and see the victory the   Lord   will win for you today . for these Egyptians whom you see today you will never see again .      the   Lord   will fight for you ; you have only to keep still .     then the   Lord   say to Moses : why be you cry out to I ? tell the Israelites to set out .      and you , lift up your staff and stretch out your hand over the sea , and split it in two , that the Israelites may pass through the sea on dry land .      but I will harden the heart of the Egyptians so that they will go in after they , and I will receive glory through Pharaoh and all his army , his chariot and his horseman .      the Egyptians will know that I be the   Lord , when I receive glory through Pharaoh , his chariot , and his horseman .     the angel of God ,    who have be lead Israels army , now move and go around behind they . and the column of cloud , move from in front of they , take up its place behind they ,      so that it come between the egyptian army and that of Israel . and when it become dark , the cloud illumine the night ; and so the rival camp do not come any close together all night long .         then Moses stretch out his hand over the sea ; and the   Lord   drive back the sea with a strong east wind all night long and turn the sea into dry ground . the water be split ,      so that the Israelites enter into the midst of the sea on dry land , with the water as a wall to their right and to their left .    Rout of the Egyptians .     the Egyptians follow in pursuit after them\xe2\x80\x94all Pharaohs horse and chariot and horsemen\xe2\x80\x94into the midst of the sea .      but during the watch just before dawn , the   Lord   look down from a column of fiery cloud upon the egyptian army and throw it into a panic ;      and he so clog their chariot wheel that they could drive only with difficulty . with that the Egyptians say , let we flee from Israel , because the   Lord   be fight for they against Egypt .     then the   Lord   speak to Moses : stretch out your hand over the sea , that the water may flow back upon the Egyptians , upon their chariot and their horseman .      so Moses stretch out his hand over the sea , and at daybreak the sea return to its normal flow . the Egyptians be flee head on toward it when the   Lord   cast the Egyptians into the midst of the sea .       as the water flow back , it cover the chariot and the horseman . of all Pharaohs army which have follow the Israelites into the sea , not even one escape .      but the Israelites have walk on dry land through the midst of the sea , with the water as a wall to their right and to their left .      thus the   Lord   save Israel on that day from the power of Egypt . when Israel see the Egyptians lie dead on the seashore      and see the great power that the   Lord   have show against Egypt , the people fear the   Lord . they believe in the   Lord    and in Moses his servant .
