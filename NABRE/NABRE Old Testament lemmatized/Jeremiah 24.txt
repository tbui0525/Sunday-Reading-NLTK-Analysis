b '   the two Baskets of Figs .      the   Lord   show I two basket of fig place before the temple of the   Lord .    this be after Nebuchadnezzar , king of Babylon , have exile from Jerusalem Jeconiah ,    son of Jehoiakim , king of Judah , and the prince of Judah , the artisan and smith , and bring they to Babylon .      one basket contain excellent fig , those that ripen early . but the other basket contain very bad fig , so bad they could not be eat .      then the   Lord   say to I : what do you see , Jeremiah ?    fig , I reply ; the good one be very good , but the bad one very bad , so bad they can not be eat .      thereupon this word of the   Lord   come to I :      thus say the   Lord , the God of Israel : like these good fig , I will also regard with favor Judahs exile whom I send away from this place into the land of the Chaldeans .        I will look after they for good and bring they back to this land , to build they up , not tear they down ; to plant they , not uproot they .        I will give they a heart to know I , that I be the   Lord . they shall be my people and I will be their God , for they shall return to I with their whole heart .        but like the fig that be bad , so bad they can not be eaten\xe2\x80\x94yes , thus say the   Lord \xe2\x80\x94even so will I treat Zedekiah , king of Judah , and his prince , the remnant of Jerusalem remain in this land and those who have settle in the land of Egypt .        I will make they an object of horror to all the kingdom of the earth , a reproach and a byword , a taunt and a curse , in all the place to which I will drive they .        I will send upon they sword , famine , and pestilence , until they have disappear from the land which I give they and their ancestor .              '
