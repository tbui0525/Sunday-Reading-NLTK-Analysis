b '   plea for Fidelity to the Covenant .     the word that come to Jeremiah from the   Lord :      speak to the people of Judah and the inhabitant of Jerusalem ,      and say to they : thus say the   Lord , the God of Israel : cursed be anyone who do not observe the word of this covenant ,        which I command your ancestor the day I bring they up out of the land of Egypt , that iron furnace , say : listen to my voice and do all that I command you . then you shall be my people , and I will be your God .        thus I will fulfill the oath I swear to your ancestor , to give they a land flow with milk and honey , the one you have today . amen ,   Lord , I answer .     then the   Lord   say to I : proclaim all these word in the city of Judah and in the street of Jerusalem : hear the word of this covenant and obey they .      I warn your ancestor unceasingly from the day I bring they up out of the land of Egypt even to this day : obey my voice .      but they do not listen or obey . they each walk in the stubbornness of their evil heart , till I bring upon they all the threat of this covenant which they have fail to observe as I command they .      a conspiracy have be find , the   Lord   say to I , among the people of Judah and the inhabitant of Jerusalem :      they have return to the crime of their ancestor who refuse to obey my word . they also have follow and serve other god ; the house of Israel and the house of Judah have break the covenant I make with their ancestor .        therefore , thus say the   Lord : see , I be bring upon they a disaster they can not escape . though they cry out to I , I will not listen to they .        then the city of Judah and the inhabitant of Jerusalem will go and cry out to the god to whom they have be offer incense . but these god will give they no help whatever in the time of their disaster .      for as many as your city   be your god , o Judah ! as many as the street of Jerusalem   be the altar for sacrifice to Baal .      now , you must not intercede for this people ; do not raise on their behalf a cry or prayer ! I will not listen when they call to I in the time of their disaster .     sacrifice of no avail   what right have my beloved in my house ,   while she devise her plot ? can vow and sacred meat turn away   your disaster from you ? will you still be jubilant    when you hear the great tumult ? the   Lord   have name you   a spread olive tree , a pleasure to behold ; now he set fire to it ,   its branch burn .     the   Lord   of host who plant you have decree disaster for you because of the evil do by the house of Israel and by the house of Judah , who provoke I by sacrifice to Baal .     the plot against Jeremiah .     I know it because the   Lord   inform I : at that time you show I their doing .     yet I be like a trust lamb lead to slaughter , not know that they be hatch plot against I : let we destroy the tree in its vigor ; let we cut he off from the land of the living , so that his name will no long be remember .      but , you ,   Lord   of host , just Judge ,   searcher of mind and heart , let I witness the vengeance you take on they ,   for to you I have entrust my cause !      therefore , thus say the   Lord   concern the man of Anathoth who seek your life and say , do not prophesy in the name of the   Lord ; otherwise you shall die by our hand .        therefore , thus say the   Lord   of host : I be go to punish they . the young man shall die by the sword ; their son and daughter shall die by famine .        none shall be spare among they , for I will bring disaster upon the man of Anathoth , the year of their punishment .
