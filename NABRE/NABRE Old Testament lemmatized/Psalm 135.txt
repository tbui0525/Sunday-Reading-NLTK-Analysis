b ' praise of God , the Ruler and Benefactor of Israel   Hallelujah ! I praise the name of the   Lord !   Praise , you servant of the   Lord ,    who stand in the house of the   Lord ,   in the court of the house of our God !    praise the   Lord , for the   Lord   be good !   sing to his name , for it bring joy !    for the   Lord   have choose Jacob for himself ,   Israel as his treasured possession .     II   for I know that the   Lord   be great ,   that our Lord be great than all god .    whatever the   Lord   desire   he do in heaven and on earth ,   in the sea and all the depth .    it be he who raise storm cloud from the end of the earth ,   make lightning for the rain ,   and bring forth wind from his storehouse .     III   he strike down Egypts firstborn ,    of human being and beast alike ,   and send sign and wonder against you , Egypt ,   against Pharaoh and all his servant .   it be he who strike down many nation ,    and slew mighty kings\xe2\x80\x94   Sihon , king of the Amorites ,   and Og , king of Bashan ,   all the king of Canaan\xe2\x80\x94   and make their land a heritage ,   a heritage for Israel his people .   o   Lord , your name be forever ,   your renown , from generation to generation !    for the   Lord   defend his people ,   show mercy to his servant .     IV   the idol of the nation be silver and gold ,    the work of human hand .   they have mouth but do not speak ;   they have eye but do not see ;   they have ear but do not hear ;   nor be there breath in their mouth .   their maker will become like they ,   and anyone who trust in they .    V   House of Israel , bless the   Lord !    House of Aaron , bless the   Lord !   House of Levi , bless the   Lord !   you who fear the   Lord , bless the   Lord !   bless be the   Lord   from Zion ,   who dwell in Jerusalem ! Hallelujah !             '
