b '   Abrahams Visitors .      the   Lord   appear to Abraham by the oak of Mamre , as he sit in the entrance of his tent , while the day be grow hot .      look up , he see three man stand near he . when he see they , he run from the entrance of the tent to greet they ; and bow to the ground ,        he say : Sir ,    if it please you , do not go on past your servant .      let some water be bring , that you may bathe your foot , and then rest under the tree .      now that you have come to your servant , let I bring you a little food , that you may refresh yourself ; and afterward you may go on your way . very well , they reply , do as you have say .     Abraham hurry into the tent to Sarah and say , Quick , three measure    of bran flour ! knead it and make bread .      he run to the herd , pick out a tender , choice calf , and give it to a servant , who quickly prepare it .      then he get some curds    and milk , as well as the calf that have be prepare , and set these before they , wait on they under the tree while they eat .     where be your wife Sarah ? they ask he . there in the tent , he reply .      one of they    say , I will return to you about this time next year , and Sarah will then have a son . Sarah be listen at the entrance of the tent , just behind he .        now Abraham and Sarah be old , advanced in year , and Sarah have stop have her menstrual period .        so Sarah laugh    to herself and say , now that I be wear out and my husband be old , be I still to have sexual pleasure ?      but the   Lord   say to Abraham : why do Sarah laugh and say , will I really bear a child , old as I be ?      be anything too marvelous for the   Lord   to do ? at the appoint time , about this time next year , I will return to you , and Sarah will have a son .        Sarah lie , say , I do not laugh , because she be afraid . but he say , yes , you do .    Abraham Intercedes for Sodom .     with Abraham walk with they to see they on their way , the man set out from there and look down toward Sodom .      the   Lord   consider : shall I hide from Abraham what I be about to do ,      now that he be to become a great and mighty nation , and all the nation of the earth be to find blessing in he ?        indeed , I have single he out that he may direct his child and his household in the future to keep the way of the   Lord   by do what be right and just , so that the   Lord   may put into effect for Abraham the promise he make about he .       so the   Lord   say : the outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah be so great , and their sin so grave ,        that I must go down to see whether or not their action be as bad as the cry against they that come to I . I mean to find out .     as the man turn and walk on toward Sodom , Abraham remained stand before the   Lord .      then Abraham draw near and say : will you really sweep away the righteous with the wicked ?      suppose there be fifty righteous people in the city ; would you really sweep away and not spare the place for the sake of the fifty righteous people within it ?      far be it from you to do such a thing , to kill the righteous with the wicked , so that the righteous and the wicked be treat alike ! far be it from you ! should not the judge of all the world do what be just ?        the   Lord   reply : if I find fifty righteous people in the city of Sodom , I will spare the whole place for their sake .      Abraham speak up again : see how I be presume to speak to my Lord , though I be only dust and ashe !        what if there be five less than fifty righteous people ? will you destroy the whole city because of those five ? I will not destroy it , he answer , if I find forty - five there .      but Abraham persist , say , what if only forty be find there ? he reply : I will refrain from do it for the sake of the forty .      then he say , do not let my Lord be angry if I go on . what if only thirty be find there ? he reply : I will refrain from do it if I can find thirty there .      Abraham go on , since I have thus presume to speak to my Lord , what if there be no more than twenty ? I will not destroy it , he answer , for the sake of the twenty .      but he persist : please , do not let my Lord be angry if I speak up this last time . what if ten be find there ? for the sake of the ten , he reply , I will not destroy it .      the   Lord   depart as soon as he have finish speak with Abraham , and Abraham return home .
