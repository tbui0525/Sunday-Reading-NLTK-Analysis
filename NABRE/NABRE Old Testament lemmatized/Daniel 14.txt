b '   Bel and the Dragon .      after King Astyages    be gather to his ancestor , Cyrus the Persian succeed to his kingdom .      Daniel be a companion of the king and be hold in high honor than any of the Friends of the King .      the Babylonians have an idol call Bel ,    and every day they provide for it six bushel of fine flour , forty sheep , and six measure of wine .      the king revere it and go every day to worship it ; but Daniel worship only his God .      when the king ask he , why do you not worship Bel ? Daniel reply , because I do not revere idol make with hand , but only the live God who make heaven and earth and have dominion over all flesh .      then the king continue , you do not think Bel be a live god ? do you not see how much he eat and drink every day ?      Daniel begin to laugh . do not be deceive , o king , he say ; it be only clay inside and bronze outside ; it have never eat or drunk anything .      enrage , the king call his priest and say to they , unless you tell I who it be that consume these provision , you shall die . but if you can show that Bel consume they , Daniel shall die for blaspheme Bel .      Daniel say to the king , let it be as you say ! there be seventy priest of Bel , besides their wife and child .       when the king go with Daniel into the temple of Bel ,      the priest of Bel say , see , we be go to leave . you , o king , set out the food and prepare the wine ; then shut the door and seal it with your ring .       if you do not find that Bel have eat it all when you return in the morning , we be to die ; otherwise Daniel shall die for his lie against we .      they be not perturb , because under the table they have make a secret entrance through which they always come in to consume the food .      after they depart the king set the food before Bel , while Daniel order his servant to bring some ashe , which they scatter through the whole temple ; the king alone be present . then they go outside , seal the closed door with the king ring , and depart .       the priest enter that night as usual , with their wife and child , and they eat and drink everything .     early the next morning , the king come with Daniel .      be the seal unbroken , Daniel ? he ask . and Daniel answer , they be unbroken , o king .      as soon as he have open the door , the king look at the table and cry aloud , you be great , o Bel ; there be no deceit in you .       but Daniel laugh and keep the king from enter . he say , look at the floor and consider whose footprint these be .      I see the footprint of man , woman , and child ! say the king .       in his wrath the king arrest the priest , their wife , and their child . they show he the secret door by which they use to enter to consume what be on the table .      the king put they to death , and hand Bel over to Daniel , who destroy it and its temple .     there be a great dragon    which the Babylonians revere .      the king say to Daniel , you can not deny that this be a live god , so worship it .      but Daniel answer , I worship the Lord , my God , for he be the live God .      give I permission , o king , and I will kill this dragon without sword or club . I give you permission , the king say .      then Daniel take some pitch , fat , and hair ; these he boil together and make into cake . he put they into the mouth of the dragon , and when the dragon eat they , he burst . this , he say , be what you revere .     when the Babylonians hear this , they be angry and turn against the king . the king have become a Jew , they say ; he have destroy Bel , kill the dragon , and put the priest to death .      they go to the king and demand : Hand Daniel over to we , or we will kill you and your family .      when he see himself threaten with violence , the king be force to hand Daniel over to they .      they throw Daniel into a lion den ,    where he remain six day .      in the den be seven lion . two carcass and two sheep have be give to they daily , but now they be give nothing , so that they would devour Daniel .     the prophet Habakkuk be in Judea . he mix some bread in a bowl with the stew he have boil , and be go to bring it to the reaper in the field ,      when an angel of the Lord tell he , take the meal you have to Daniel in the lion den at Babylon .      but Habakkuk answer , Sir , I have never see Babylon , and I do not know the den !      the angel of the Lord seize he by the crown of his head and carry he by the hair ;    with the speed of the wind , he set he down in Babylon above the den .      Daniel , Daniel , cry Habakkuk , take the meal God have send you .      you have remember I , o God , say Daniel ; you have not forsake those who love you .      so Daniel eat , but the angel of God at once bring Habakkuk back to his own place .     on the seventh day the king come to mourn for Daniel . as he come to the den and look in , there be Daniel , sit there .      the king cry aloud , you be great , o Lord , the God of Daniel , and there be no other besides you !      he bring Daniel out , but those who have try to destroy he he throw into the den , and they be devour in a moment before his eye .
