b '   Ziklag in Ruins .     before David and his man reach Ziklag on the third day , the Amalekites have raid the Negeb and Ziklag . they storm Ziklag , and set it on fire .        they take captive the woman and all who be in the city , young and old , kill no one , and they herd they off when they leave .      David and his man arrive at the city to find it burn to the ground and their wife , son , and daughter take captive .      then David and those who be with he weep aloud until they could weep no more .      Davids two wife , Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail , the widow of Nabal from Carmel , have also be carry off .        now David find himself in great danger , for the soldier speak of stone he , so bitter be they over the fate of their son and daughter . David take courage in the   Lord   his God       and say to Abiathar , the priest , son of Ahimelech , bring I the ephod ! when Abiathar bring he the ephod ,      David inquire of the   Lord , shall I pursue these raider ? can I overtake they ? the   Lord   answer he : go in pursuit , for you will certainly overtake they and bring about a rescue .    Raid on the Amalekites .     so David go off with his six hundred as far as the Wadi Besor , where those who be to remain behind halt .      David continue the pursuit with four hundred , but two hundred be too exhausted to cross the Wadi Besor and remain behind .      an Egyptian be find in the open country and bring to David . they give he food to eat and water to drink ;      they also offer a cake of press fig and two cake of pressed raisin . when he have eat , he revive , for he have not take food nor drunk water for three day and three night .      then David ask he , to whom do you belong ? where do you come from ? I be an Egyptian , the slave of an Amalekite , he reply . my master abandon I three day ago because I fall sick .      we raid the Negeb of the Cherethites , the territory of Judah , and the Negeb of Caleb ; and we set Ziklag on fire .        David then ask he , will you lead I down to these raider ? he answer , swear to I by God that you will not kill I or hand I over to my master , and I will lead you down to the raider .      so he lead they down , and there be the Amalekites lounge all over the ground , eating , drink , and celebrate because of all the rich plunder they have take from the land of the Philistines and from the land of Judah .    the Plunder recover .     from dawn to sundown the next day David attack they , allow no one to escape except four hundred young man , who mount their camel and flee .        David recover everything the Amalekites have take , and he rescue his two wife .      nothing be miss , small or great , plunder or son or daughter , of all that the Amalekites have take . David bring back everything .      moreover , David take all the sheep and oxen , and as they drive these before he , they shout , this be Davids plunder !    Division of the Plunder .     when David come to the two hundred man who have be too exhausted to follow he , whom he have leave behind at the Wadi Besor , they come out to meet David and the man with he . as David approach , he greet they .      but all the greedy and worthless among those who have accompany David say , since they do not accompany we , we will not give they anything from the plunder , except for each mans wife and child .      but David say : you must not do this , my brother , after what the   Lord   have give we . the   Lord   have protect we and deliver into our hand the raider that come against we .        who could agree with this proposal of your ? rather , the share of the one who go down to battle shall be the same as that of the one who remain with the baggage\xe2\x80\x94they share alike .        and from that day forward he make this a law and a custom in Israel , as it still be today .     Davids Gifts to Judah .     when David come to Ziklag , he send part of the plunder to his friend , the elder of Judah ,    say , this be a gift to you from the plunder of the enemy of the   Lord , namely ,      to those in Bethel , Ramoth - negeb , Jattir ,      Aroer , Siphmoth , Eshtemoa ,      Racal , jerahmeelite city and Kenite city ,        Hormah , Borashan , Athach ,      Hebron , and to all the place that David and his man have frequent .
