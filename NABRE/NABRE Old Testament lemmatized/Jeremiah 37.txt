b '   Jeremiah in the Dungeon .     Zedekiah , son of Josiah , become king , succeed Coniah , son of Jehoiakim ; Nebuchadnezzar , king of Babylon , appoint he king over the land of Judah .        neither he , nor his official , nor the people of the land would listen to the word which the   Lord   speak through Jeremiah the prophet .      yet King Zedekiah send Jehucal , son of Shelemiah , and Zephaniah , son of Maaseiah the priest , to Jeremiah the prophet with this request : please appeal to the   Lord , our God , for we .        at this time Jeremiah still come and go freely among the people ; he have not yet be put into prison .        meanwhile , Pharaohs army    have set out from Egypt , and when the Chaldeans who be besiege Jerusalem hear this report , they withdraw from the city .      then the word of the   Lord   come to Jeremiah the prophet :      thus say the   Lord , the God of Israel : thus you must say to the king of Judah who send you to consult I : listen ! Pharaohs army , which have set out to help you , will return to Egypt , its own land .        the Chaldeans shall return and attack this city ; they shall capture it and destroy it by fire .      thus say the   Lord : do not deceive yourself , say : the Chaldeans be surely leave we forever . they be not !      even if you could defeat the whole chaldean army that be now attack you , and only the wound remain , each in his tent , these would rise up and destroy the city with fire .      now when the chaldean army withdraw from Jerusalem because of the army of Pharaoh ,        Jeremiah set out from Jerusalem to go to the territory of Benjamin , to receive his share of property among the people .      but at the Gate of Benjamin , the captain of the guard , by the name of Irijah , son of Shelemiah , son of Hananiah , arrest Jeremiah the prophet , say , you be desert to the Chaldeans !      that be a lie ! Jeremiah answer , I be not desert to the Chaldeans . without listen to he , Irijah keep Jeremiah in custody and bring he to the prince .     the prince be enrage at Jeremiah and have Jeremiah beat and imprison in the house of Jonathan the scribe , for they be use it as a jail .        and so Jeremiah go into a room in the dungeon , where he remain many day .     then King Zedekiah have he bring to his palace , and he ask he secretly , be there any word from the   Lord ? there be ! Jeremiah answer : you shall be hand over to the king of Babylon .        Jeremiah then ask King Zedekiah : how have I wrong you or your official or this people , that you should put I in prison ?        where be your own prophet who prophesy for you , say : the King of Babylon will not attack you or this land ?      please hear I , my lord king ! Grant my petition : do not send I back into the house of Jonathan the scribe , or I shall die there .     so King Zedekiah order that Jeremiah be confine in the court of the guard and give a ration of bread every day from the baker street until all the bread in the city be eat up . thus Jeremiah remain in the court of the guard .
