b '   the Valley of Vision    Oracle on the Valley of Vision :    what be the matter with you now , that you have go up ,   all of you , to the housetop ,    you who be full of noise ,   tumultuous city ,   exultant town ?   your slain be not slay with the sword ,   nor kill in battle .   all your leader flee away together ,   they be capture without use of bow ; all who be find be capture together ,   though they have flee afar off .   that be why I say : turn away from I ,   let I weep bitterly ; do not try to comfort I   for the ruin of the daughter of my people .    it be a day of panic , rout and confusion ,   from the Lord , the   God   of host , in the Valley of Vision   wall crash ;   a cry for help to the mountain .   Elam take up the quiver ,   Aram mount the horse   and Kir    uncover the shield .   your choice valley be fill with chariot ,   horse be post at the gates\xe2\x80\x94    and shelter over Judah be remove .   on that day you look to the weapon in the House of the Forest ;       you see that the breach in the City of David be many ; you collect the water of the low pool .      you number the house of Jerusalem , tear some down to strengthen the wall ;      you make a reservoir between the two wall for the water of the old pool . but you do not look to the citys maker , nor consider the one who fashion it long ago .     on that day the Lord ,   the   God   of host , call for weeping and mourning ,   for shave the head and wear sackcloth .   but look ! instead , there be celebration and joy ,   slaughter cattle and butcher sheep , eat meat and drink wine :   eat and drink , for tomorrow we die !      this message be reveal in my hearing from the   Lord   of host :   this iniquity will not be forgive you until you die ,   say the Lord , the   God   of host .    Shebna and Eliakim   thus say the Lord , the   God   of host :   up , go to that official ,   Shebna ,    master of the palace ,    what have you here ? whom have you here ,   that you have hew for yourself a tomb here , hew a tomb on high ,   carve a rest place in the rock ?   the   Lord   shall hurl you down headlong , mortal man !   he shall grip you firmly ,   and roll you up and toss you like a ball   into a broad land . there you will die , there with the chariot you glory in ,   you disgrace to your master house !   I will thrust you from your office   and pull you down from your station .   on that day I will summon my servant   Eliakim ,    son of Hilkiah ;    I will clothe he with your robe ,   gird he with your sash ,   confer on he your authority . he shall be a father to the inhabitant of Jerusalem ,   and to the house of Judah .    I will place the key    of the House of David on his shoulder ;   what he open , no one will shut ,   what he shut , no one will open .    I will fix he as a peg in a firm place ,   a seat of honor for his ancestral house ;   on he shall hang all the glory of his ancestral house :    descendant and offspring ,   all the little dish , from bowl to jug .     on that day , say the   Lord   of host , the peg fix in a firm place shall give way , break off and fall , and the weight that hang on it shall be do away with ; for the   Lord   have speak .
