b '   Pharaohs hardness of heart .     afterwards , Moses and Aaron go to Pharaoh and say , thus say the   Lord , the God of Israel : let my people go , that they may hold a feast    for I in the wilderness .      Pharaoh answer , who be the   Lord , that I should obey he and let Israel go ? I do not know the   Lord ,    and I will not let Israel go .      they reply , the God of the Hebrews have come to meet we . let we go a three day journey in the wilderness , that we may offer sacrifice to the   Lord , our God ,    so that he do not strike we with the plague or the sword .      the king of Egypt answer they , why , Moses and Aaron , do you make the people neglect their work ? off to your labor !      Pharaoh continue , look how they be already more numerous    than the people of the land , and yet you would give they rest from their labor !     that very day Pharaoh give the taskmaster of the people and their foreman    this order :      you shall no long supply the people with straw for their brickmaking    as before . let they go and gather their own straw !      yet you shall levy upon they the same quota of brick as they make previously . do not reduce it . they be lazy ; that be why they be cry , let we go to offer sacrifice to our God .      increase the work for the man , so that they attend to it and not to deceitful word .     so the taskmaster of the people and their foreman go out and tell the people , thus say Pharaoh ,    I will not provide you with straw .      go and get your own straw from wherever you can find it . but there will not be the slight reduction in your work .      the people , then , scatter throughout the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw ,      while the taskmaster keep drive they on , say , finish your work , the same daily amount as when the straw be supply to you .      the israelite foremen , whom the taskmaster of Pharaoh have place over they , be beat , and be ask , why have you not complete your prescribed amount of brick yesterday and today , as before ?    complaint of the Foremen .     then the israelite foreman come and cry out to Pharaoh :    why do you treat your servant in this manner ?      no straw be supply to your servant , and still we be tell , make brick ! look how your servant be beat ! it be you who be at fault .      he answer , Lazy ! you be lazy ! that be why you keep say , let we go and offer sacrifice to the   Lord .      now off to work ! no straw will be supply to you , but you must supply your quota of brick .     the israelite foreman realize they be in trouble , having be tell , do not reduce your daily amount of brick !      so when they leave Pharaoh they assail Moses and Aaron , who be wait to meet they ,      and say to they , the   Lord   look upon you and judge ! you have make we offensive to Pharaoh and his servant , put a sword into their hand to kill we .    Renewal of Gods Promise .     then Moses again have recourse to the   Lord   and say ,   Lord , why have you treat this people badly ? and why do you send I ?      from the time I go to Pharaoh to speak in your name , he have treat this people badly , and you have do nothing to rescue your people .
