b ' A Lament over Widespread Corruption   for the leader . of David . I the fool say in his heart ,   there be no God . their deed be loathsome and corrupt ;   not one do what be good .    the   Lord   look down from heaven   upon the child of man ,   to see if even one be wise ,   if even one seek God .    all have go astray ;   all alike be perverse . not one do what be good ,   not even one .     II   will these evildoer never learn ?   they devour my people as they devour bread ;    they do not call upon the   Lord .    they have good reason , then , to fear ;   God be with the company of the just .   they would crush the hope of the poor ,   but the poor have the   Lord   as their refuge .    III    oh , that from Zion might come   the salvation of Israel ! Jacob would rejoice , and Israel be glad   when the   Lord   restore his people !              '
