b '   Moab     Oracle on Moab : laid waste in a night ,   Ar of Moab be destroy ; Laid waste in a night ,   Kir of Moab be destroy .   Daughter Dibon have go up   to the high place to weep ; over Nebo and over Medeba   Moab be wail . every head be shave ,   every beard shear off .     in the street they wear sackcloth ,   and on the rooftop ; in the square   everyone wail , stream with tear .    Heshbon and Elealeh cry out ,   they be hear as far as Jahaz . at this the loin of Moab tremble ,   his soul quiver within he ;    my heart cry out for Moab ,   his fugitive reach Zoar ,   Eglath - shelishiyah : the ascent of Luhith   they ascend weeping ; on the way to Horonaim   they utter rend cry ;    the water of Nimrim   have become a waste , the grass be wither ,   new growth be go ,   nothing be green .   so now whatever they have acquire or store away   they carry across the Wadi of the Poplars .   the cry have go round   the territory of Moab ; as far as Eglaim his wail ,   even at beer - elim his wail .    the water of Dimon be fill with blood ,   but I will bring still more upon Dimon : lion for those who be flee from Moab   and for those who remain in the land !
