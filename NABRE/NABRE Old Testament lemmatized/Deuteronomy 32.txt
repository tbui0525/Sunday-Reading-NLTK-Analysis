b '     give ear , o heavens , and let I speak ;   let the earth hear the word of my mouth !    may my teaching soak in like the rain ,   and my utterance drench like the dew , like a downpour upon the grass ,   like a shower upon the crop .   for I will proclaim the name of the   Lord ,   praise the greatness of our God !     the Rock\xe2\x80\x94how faultless be his deed ,   how right all his way ! a faithful God , without deceit ,   just and upright be he !      yet his degenerate child have treat he basely ,   a twisted and crooked generation !    be this how you repay the   Lord ,   so foolish and unwise a people ? be he not your father who begot you ,   the one who make and establish you ?      remember the day of old ,   consider the year of generation past . ask your father , he will inform you ,   your elder , they will tell you :    when the most High allot each nation its heritage ,   when he separate out human being ,   he set up the boundary of the people   after the number of the divine being ;    but the   Lord s portion be his people ;   his allot share be Jacob .      he find they in a wilderness ,   a wasteland of howl desert . he shield they , care for they ,   guard they as the apple of his eye .    as an eagle incite its nestling ,   hover over its young , so he spread his wing , take they ,   bear they upon his pinion .    the   Lord   alone guide they ,   no foreign god be with they .       he have they mount the summit of the land ,    feed they the produce of its field ; he suckle they with honey from the crag   and olive oil from the flinty rock ;   Butter from cow and milk from sheep ,   with the good of lamb ; Bashan    bull and goat ,   with the cream of fine wheat ;   and the foam blood of grape you drink .     so Jacob eat and be satisfied ,   Jeshurun    grow fat and kick ;   you become fat and gross and gorge . they forsook the God who make they   and scorn the Rock of their salvation .    with strange god they incite he ,   with abomination provoke he to anger .    they sacrifice to demon , to no - god ,   to god they have never know , newcomer from afar ,   before whom your ancestor have never tremble .   you be unmindful of the Rock that begot you ,   you forget the God who give you birth .      the   Lord   see and be fill with loathing ,   provoke by his son and daughter .    he say , I will hide my face from they ,   and see what become of they . for they be a fickle generation ,   child with no loyalty in they !    since they have incite I with a no - god ,   and provoke I with their empty idol , I will incite they with a no - people ;    with a foolish nation I will provoke they .    for by my wrath a fire be kindle   that have rage to the depth of Sheol , it have consume the earth with its yield ,   and set on fire the foundation of the mountain .    I will heap evil upon they   and exhaust all my arrow against they :    emaciate hunger and consume fever   and bitter pestilence , and the tooth of wild beast I will send among they ,   with the venom of reptile glide in the dust .    out in the street the sword shall bereave ,   and at home the terror for the young man and the young woman alike ,   the nursing babe as well as the gray beard .    I say : I will make an end of they   and blot out their name from human memory ,   have I not fear the provocation by the enemy ,   that their foe might misunderstand , and say , our own hand win the victory ;   the   Lord   have nothing to do with any of it .    for they be a nation devoid of reason ,    have no understanding .   if they have insight they would realize this ,   they would understand their end :   how could one rout a thousand ,   or two put ten thousand to flight , unless it be because their Rock sell they ,   the   Lord   deliver they up ?     indeed , their rock be not like our Rock ;   our enemy be fool .   for their vine be from the vine of Sodom ,   from the vineyard of Gomorrah . their grape be grape of poison ,   and their cluster be bitter .    their wine be the venom of serpent ,   the cruel poison of viper .   be not this store up with I ,   seal up in my storehouse ?   Vengeance be mine and recompense ,   for the time they lose their footing ; because the day of their disaster be at hand   and their doom be rush upon they !      surely , the   Lord   will do justice for his people ;   on his servant he will have pity . when he see their strength be go ,   and neither bond nor free    be leave ,    he will say , where be their god ,    the rock in whom they take refuge ,   who eat the fat of their sacrifice   and drink the wine of their libation ? let they rise up now and help you !   let they be your protection !   see now that I , I alone , be he ,   and there be no god besides I . it be I who bring both death and life ,   I who inflict wound and heal they ,   and from my hand no one can deliver .    for I raise my hand to the heaven   and will say : as surely as I live forever ,   when I sharpen my flash sword ,   and my hand lay hold of judgment , with vengeance I will repay my foe   and requite those who hate I .    I will make my arrow drunk with blood ,   and my sword shall devour flesh\xe2\x80\x94 with the blood of the slain and the capture ,   from the long - haired head of the enemy .     exult with he , you heavens ,   bow to he , all you divine being ! for he will avenge the blood of his servant ,   take vengeance on his foe ; he will requite those who hate he ,   and purge his people land .      so Moses , together with Hoshea ,    son of Nun , go and speak all the word of this song in the hearing of the people .     Final Appeal .     when Moses have finish speak all these word to all Israel ,      he say to they ,    take to heart all the word that I be give in witness against you today , word you should command your child , that they may observe carefully every word of this law .      for this be no trivial matter for you , but rather your very life ; by this word you will enjoy a long life on the land you be cross the Jordan to possess .     Moses look upon Canaan .     on that very day the   Lord   say to Moses ,      ascend this mountain of the Abarim ,    Mount Nebo in the land of Moab face Jericho , and view the land of Canaan , which I be give to the Israelites as a possession .        then you shall die on the mountain you be about to ascend , and shall be gather to your people , just as your brother Aaron die on Mount Hor    and there be gather to his people ,        because both of you break faith with I among the Israelites at the water of Meribath - kadesh in the wilderness of Zin : you do not manifest my holiness among the Israelites .         you may indeed see the land from a distance , but you shall not enter that land which I be give to the Israelites .
