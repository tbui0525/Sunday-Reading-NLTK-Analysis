Joshua then bless they and send they away , and they go to their tent .     ( for , to half of the tribe of Manasseh Moses have assign land in Bashan ;    and to the other half Joshua have give a portion along with their ally west of the Jordan . ) when Joshua send they away to their tent and bless they ,      he say , now that you be return to your own tent with great wealth , with abundant livestock , with silver , gold , bronze and iron , and with a very large supply of clothing , divide these spoil of your enemy with your ally there .        so the Reubenites , the Gadites , and the half - tribe of Manasseh leave the other Israelites at Shiloh in the land of Canaan and return to the land of Gilead , their own land , which they have receive accord to the   Lord s command through Moses .     the Altar beside the Jordan .     when the Reubenites , the Gadites , and the half - tribe of Manasseh come to the region of the Jordan in the land of Canaan , they build an altar there at the Jordan , an impressively large altar .      the other Israelites hear the report :    the Reubenites , the Gadites , and the half - tribe of Manasseh have build an altar in the region of the Jordan face the land of Canaan ,    across from the Israelites .      when the Israelites hear this , they assemble at Shiloh , as the entire israelite community to take military action against they .     accusation of the Western Tribes .     the Israelites send Phinehas , son of Eleazar the priest , to the Reubenites , the Gadites , and the half - tribe of Manasseh in the land of Gilead ,        and with he ten leader , one from each tribe of Israel , each one the head of an ancestral house among the clan of Israel .      when these come to the Reubenites , the Gadites , and the half - tribe of Manasseh in the land of Gilead , they say to they :      thus say the whole community of the   Lord : what act of treachery be this you have commit against the God of Israel ? this day you have turn from follow the   Lord ; by build an altar of your own you have rebel against the   Lord   this day .      be the iniquity of Peor not enough , by which we make ourselves impure , even to this day , and a plague come upon the community of the   Lord ?        if today you turn away from follow the   Lord , and rebel against the   Lord , tomorrow he will be angry with the whole community of Israel !      if you consider the land you now possess unclean ,    cross over to the land the   Lord   possess , where the tabernacle of the   Lord   stand , and share that with we . but do not rebel against the   Lord , nor involve we in rebellion , by build an altar of your own in addition to the altar of the   Lord , our God .      when Achan , son of Zerah ,    act treacherously by violate the ban , be it not upon the entire community of Israel that wrath fall ? though he be but a single man , he do not perish alone    for his guilt !    Reply of the Eastern Tribes .     the Reubenites , the Gadites , and the half - tribe of Manasseh reply to the head of the israelite clan :      the   Lord   be the God of god . the   Lord , the God of god ,    know and Israel shall know . if now we have act out of rebellion or treachery against the   Lord , our God , do not try to save we this day ,      and if we have build an altar of our own to turn from follow the   Lord , or to sacrifice burn offering , grain offering , or communion sacrifice upon it , the   Lord   himself will exact the penalty .      we do it rather out of our anxious concern lest in the future your child should say to our child : what have you to do with the   Lord , the God of Israel ?      for the   Lord   have place the Jordan as a boundary between you and we , you Reubenites and Gadites . you have no share in the   Lord . thus your child would prevent ours from revere the   Lord .      so we think , let we act for ourselves by build this altar of our own\xe2\x80\x94not for burn offering or sacrifice ,       but as witness between we and you and our descendant , that we have the right to provide for the service of the   Lord   in his presence with our burn offering , sacrifice , and communion sacrifice . now in the future your child can not say to our child , you have no share in the   Lord .      our thought be that , if in the future they should speak thus to we or to our descendant , we could answer : look at the copy of the altar of the   Lord   which our ancestor make , not for burn offering or for sacrifice , but to witness    between you and we .      far be it from we to rebel against the   Lord   or to turn now from follow the   Lord   by build an altar for burn offering , grain offering , or sacrifice in addition to the altar of the   Lord , our God , which stand before his tabernacle .     when Phinehas the priest and the leader of the community , the head of the israelite clan , hear what the Reubenites , the Gadites , and the Manassites have to say , they be satisfied .      Phinehas , son of Eleazar the priest , say to the Reubenites , the Gadites , and the Manassites , today we know that the   Lord   be in our midst . since you have not rebel against the   Lord   by this act of treachery , you have deliver the Israelites from the hand of the   Lord .     Phinehas , son of Eleazar the priest , and the leader return from the Reubenites and the Gadites in the land of Gilead to the Israelites in the land of Canaan , and report the matter to they .      the report satisfy the Israelites , who bless God and decide not to take military action against the Reubenites and Gadites nor to ravage the land where they live .     the Reubenites and the Gadites give the altar its name    as a witness among they that the   Lord   be God .
