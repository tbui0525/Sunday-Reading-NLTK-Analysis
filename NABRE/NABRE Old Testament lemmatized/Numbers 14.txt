b '   Threats of Revolt .     at this , the whole community break out with loud cry , and the people weep into the night .       all the Israelites grumble against Moses and Aaron , the whole community say to they , if only we have die in the land of Egypt , or if only we would die here in the wilderness !      why be the   Lord   bring we into this land only to have we fall by the sword ? our wife and little one will be take as spoil . would it not be well for we to return to Egypt ?      so they say to one another , let we appoint a leader and go back to Egypt .     but Moses and Aaron fall prostrate before the whole assemble community of the Israelites ;      while Joshua , son of Nun , and Caleb , son of Jephunneh , who have be among those that reconnoiter the land , tear their garment      and say to the whole community of the Israelites ,    the land which we go through and reconnoiter be an exceedingly good land .      if the   Lord   be pleased with we , he will bring we in to this land and give it to we , a land which flow with milk and honey .       only do not rebel against the   Lord ! you need not be afraid of the people of the land , for they be but food for we !    their protection have leave they , but the   Lord   be with we . do not fear they .    the Lords Sentence .     the whole community threaten to stone they . but the glory of the   Lord   appear at the tent of meeting to all the Israelites .      and the   Lord   say to Moses : how long will this people spurn I ? how long will they not trust I , despite all the sign I have perform among they ?        I will strike they with pestilence and disown they . then I will make of you a nation great and mighty than they .       but Moses say to the   Lord : the Egyptians will hear of this , for by your power you bring out this people from among they .      they will tell the inhabitant of this land , who have hear that you ,   Lord , be in the midst of this people ; you ,   Lord , who directly reveal yourself ! your cloud stand over they , and you go before they by day in a column of cloud and by night in a column of fire .        if now you slay this people all at once , the nation who have hear such report of you will say ,      the   Lord   be not able to bring this people into the land he swear to give they ; that be why he slaughter they in the wilderness .        now then , may my Lords forbearance be great , even as you have say ,       the   Lord   be slow to anger and abound in kindness , forgive iniquity and rebellion ; yet certainly not declare the guilty guiltless , but punish child to the third and fourth generation for their parent iniquity .      Pardon , then , the iniquity of this people in keep with your great kindness , even as you have forgive they from Egypt until now .      the   Lord   answer : I pardon they as you have ask .      yet , by my life and the   Lord s glory that fill the whole earth ,      of all the people who have see my glory and the sign I do in Egypt and in the wilderness ,    and who nevertheless have put I to the test ten time already and have not obey I ,      not one shall see the land which I promise on oath to their ancestor . none of those who have spurn I shall see it .      but as for my servant Caleb , because he have a different spirit and follow I unreservedly ,    I will bring he into the land which he enter , and his descendant shall possess it .      but now , since the Amalekites and Canaanites be live in the valley ,    turn away tomorrow and set out into the wilderness by way of the Red Sea road .     the   Lord   also say to Moses and Aaron :      how long will this wicked community grumble against I ?    I have hear the grumbling of the Israelites against I .      tell they :    by my life\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord \xe2\x80\x94i will do to you just what I have hear you say .      here in the wilderness    your dead body shall fall . of all your man of twenty year or more , enrol in your registration , who grumble against I ,      not one of you shall enter the land where I solemnly swear to settle you , except Caleb , son of Jephunneh , and Joshua , son of Nun .      your little one , however , who you say would be take as spoil , I will bring in , and they shall know the land you reject .        but as for you , your body shall fall here in the wilderness ,      while your child will wander for forty year , suffer for your infidelity , till the last of you lie dead in the wilderness .        correspond to the number of day you spend reconnoiter the land\xe2\x80\x94forty days\xe2\x80\x94you shall bear your punishment one year for each day : forty year . thus you will realize what it mean to oppose I .      I , the   Lord , have speak ; and I will surely do this to this entire wicked community that conspire against I : here in the wilderness they shall come to their end and there they will die .     and the man whom Moses have send to reconnoiter the land    and who on return have set the whole community grumble against he by spread discourage report about the land\xe2\x80\x94      these man who have spread discourage report about the land be strike down by the   Lord   and die .      only Joshua , son of Nun , and Caleb , son of Jephunneh , survive of all the man who have go to reconnoiter the land .     Unsuccessful Invasion .     when Moses repeat these word to all the Israelites , the people mourn greatly .      early the next morning they start up high into the hill country , say , here we be , ready to go up to the place that the   Lord   speak of :    for we do wrong .      but Moses say , why be you now transgress the   Lord s order ? this can not succeed .      do not go up , because the   Lord   be not in your midst ; do not allow yourself to be strike down by your enemy .        for there the Amalekites and Canaanites will face you , and you will fall by the sword . you have turn back from follow the   Lord ; therefore the   Lord   will not be with you .     yet they dare to go up high into the hill country ,    even though neither the ark of the covenant of the   Lord   nor Moses leave the camp .      and the Amalekites and Canaanites who dwelt in that hill country come down and defeat they , beat they back as far as Hormah .
