b ' Human Wickedness and Divine Providence   for the leader . of David , the servant of the   Lord .    I   Sin direct the heart of the wicked man ;   his eye be close to the fear of God .    for he live with the delusion :   his guilt will not be know and hate .    empty and false be the word of his mouth ;   he have cease to be wise and do good .   on his bed he hatch plot ;   he set out on a wicked way ;   he do not reject evil .     II    Lord , your mercy reach to heaven ;   your fidelity , to the cloud .    your justice be like the high mountain ;   your judgment , like the mighty deep ;   human being and beast you sustain ,   Lord .   how precious be your mercy , o God !   the child of Adam take refuge in the shadow of your wing .     they feast on the rich food of your house ;   from your delightful stream    you give they drink .   for with you be the fountain of life ,    and in your light we see light .    show mercy on those who know you ,   your just defense to the upright of heart .   do not let the foot of the proud overtake I ,   nor the hand of the wicked disturb I .   there make the evildoer fall ;   thrust they down , unable to rise .
