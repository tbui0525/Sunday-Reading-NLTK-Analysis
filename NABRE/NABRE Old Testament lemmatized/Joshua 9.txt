b '   Confederacy against Israel .     when the news reach all the king west of the Jordan , in the mountain region and in the Shephelah , and all along the coast of the Great Sea as far as the Lebanon : Hittites , Amorites , Canaanites , Perizzites , Hivites , and Jebusites ,        they gather together to launch a common attack against Joshua and Israel .    the Gibeonite deception .     on hear what Joshua have do to Jericho and Ai , the inhabitant of Gibeon        form their own scheme . they choose provision for a journey , make use of old sack for their donkey , and old wineskin , tear and mend .      they wear old , patched sandal and shabby garment ; and all the bread they take be dry and crumbly .      thus they journey to Joshua in the camp at Gilgal , where they say to he and to the Israelites , we have come from a far - off land ; now , make a covenant with we .        but the Israelites reply to the Hivites ,    you may be live in land that be ours . how , then , can we make a covenant with you ?      but they answer Joshua , we be your servant . then Joshua ask they , who be you ? where do you come from ?      they answer he , your servant have come from a far - off land , because of the fame of the   Lord , your God . for we have hear report of all that he do in Egypt        and all that he do to the two king of the Amorites beyond the Jordan ,    Sihon , king of Heshbon , and Og , king of Bashan , who live in Ashtaroth .      so our elder and all the inhabitant of our land say to we , take along provision for the journey and go to meet they . say to they : we be your servant ; now make a covenant with we .      this bread of our be still warm when we bring it from home as provision the day we leave to come to you , but now it be dry and crumbly .      here be our wineskin , which be new when we fill they , but now they be tear . look at our garment and sandal ; they be wear out from the very long journey .      then the israelite leader partake of their provision , without inquire of the   Lord .        so Joshua make peace with they and make a covenant to let they live ,    which the leader of the community seal with an oath .    Gibeonites make vassal .     three day after the covenant be make , the Israelites hear that these people be from nearby , and would be live in Israel .      the third day on the road , the Israelites come to their city of Gibeon , Chephirah , Beeroth , and Kiriath - jearim ,      but do not attack they , because the leader of the community have swear to they by the   Lord , the God of Israel . when the entire community grumble against the leader ,      these all remonstrate with the community , we have swear to they by the   Lord , the God of Israel , and so we can not harm they .      let we therefore let they live , and so deal with they that no wrath fall upon we because of the oath we have swear to they .        thus the leader say to they , let they live , and become hewer of wood and drawer of water    for the entire community . so the community do as the leader advise they .      Joshua summon the Gibeonites and say to they , why do you deceive we and say , we live far off from you?\xe2\x80\x94You live among we !      now be you accursed : every one of you shall always be a slave , hewer of wood and drawer of water , for the house of my God .      they answer Joshua , your servant be fully inform of how the   Lord , your God , command Moses his servant that you be give the entire land and that all its inhabitant be destroy before you . since , therefore , at your advance , we be in great fear for our life , we act as we do .        and now that we be in your power , do with we what be good and right in your eye .       Joshua do what he have decide : while he save they from be kill by the Israelites ,      on that day he make they , as they still be , hewer of wood and drawer of water for the community and for the altar of the   Lord , in the place the   Lord   would choose .
