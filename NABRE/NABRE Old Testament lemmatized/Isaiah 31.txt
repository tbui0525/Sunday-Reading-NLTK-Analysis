b '   against the Egyptian Alliance   ah ! those who go down to Egypt for help ,   who rely on horse ; who put their trust in chariot because of their number ,   and in horseman because of their combine power , but look not to the Holy One of Israel   nor seek the   Lord !     yet he too be wise and will bring disaster ;   he will not turn from his threat . he will rise up against the house of the wicked   and against those who help evildoer .    the Egyptians be human being , not God ,   their horse flesh , not spirit ; when the   Lord   stretch forth his hand ,   the helper shall stumble , the one help shall fall ,   and both of they shall perish together .     for thus say the   Lord   to I : as a lion or its young   growl over the prey , with a band of shepherd   assemble against it , be neither dismay by their shout   nor cow by their noise , so shall the   Lord   of host come down   to wage war upon Mount Zion , upon its height .    like hover bird , so the   Lord   of host   shall shield Jerusalem , to shield and deliver ,   to spare and rescue .      Return , o Israelites , to he whom you have utterly desert .        on that day each one of you shall reject his idol of silver and gold , which your hand have make .      Assyria shall fall by a sword , not wield by human being ,   no mortal sword shall devour he ; he shall flee before the sword ,   and his young man shall be impress as laborer .    he shall rush past his crag    in panic ,   and his prince desert the standard in terror , say the   Lord   who have a fire in Zion   and a furnace in Jerusalem .
