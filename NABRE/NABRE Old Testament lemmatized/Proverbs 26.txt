b '   like snow in summer , like rain in harvest ,   honor for a fool be out of place .    like the sparrow in its flitting , like the swallow in its flight ,   a curse uncalled - for never land .    the whip for the horse , the bridle for the ass ,   and the rod for the back of fool .     do not answer fool accord to their folly ,   lest you too become like they .   answer fool accord to their folly ,   lest they become wise in their own eye .   those who send message by a fool   cut off their foot ; they drink down violence .    a proverb in the mouth of a fool   hang limp , like crippled leg .   give honor to a fool   be like entangle a stone in the sling .   a thorn stick in the hand of a drunkard   be a proverb in the mouth of fool .   an archer wound all who pass by   be anyone who hire a drunken fool .   as dog return to their vomit ,   so fool repeat their folly .    you see those who be wise in their own eye ?   there be more hope for fool than for they .    the sluggard say , there be a lion in the street ,   a lion in the middle of the square !    the door turn on its hinge   and sluggard , on their bed .   the sluggard bury a hand in the dish ,   too weary to lift it to the mouth .    in their own eye sluggard be wise   than seven who answer with good judgment .   whoever meddle in the quarrel of another   be one who grab a pass dog by the ear .   like a craze archer   scatter firebrand and deadly arrow ,   such be those who deceive their neighbor ,   and then say , I be only joke .    without wood the fire die out ;   without a talebearer strife subside .   Charcoal for coal , wood for fire\xe2\x80\x94   such be the quarrelsome , enkindle strife .    the word of a talebearer be like dainty morsel :   they sink into one inmost be .     like a glaze finish on earthenware   be smooth lip and a wicked heart .    with their lip enemy pretend ,   but inwardly they maintain deceit ;   when they speak graciously , do not trust they ,    for seven abomination    be in their heart .   Hatred can be conceal by pretense ,   but malice will be reveal in the assembly .    whoever dig a pit fall into it ;   and a stone come back upon the one who roll it .    the lie tongue be its owner enemy ,   and the flattering mouth work ruin .
