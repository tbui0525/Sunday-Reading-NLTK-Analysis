b '   the Brothers First Journey to Egypt .      when Jacob learn that grain ration be for sale in Egypt , he say to his son : why do you keep look at one another ?      he go on , I hear that grain be for sale in Egypt . go down there and buy some for we , that we may stay alive and not die .        so ten of Josephs brother go down to buy grain from Egypt .      but Jacob do not send Josephs brother Benjamin with his brother , for he think some disaster might befall he .      and so the son of Israel be among those who come to buy grain , since there be famine in the land of Canaan .      Joseph , as governor of the country , be the one who sell grain to all the people of the land . when Josephs brother come , they bow down to he with their face to the ground .        he recognize they as soon as he see they . but he conceal his own identity from they and speak harshly to they . where do you come from ? he ask they . they answer , from the land of Canaan , to buy food .     when Joseph recognize his brother , although they do not recognize he ,      he be remind of the dream he have about they . he say to they : you be spy .    you have come to see the weak point    of the land .      no , my lord , they reply . on the contrary , your servant have come to buy food .      all of we be son of the same man . we be honest man ; your servant have never be spy .      but he answer they : not so ! it be the weak point of the land that you have come to see .      we your servant , they say , be twelve brother , son of a certain man in Canaan ; but the young one be at present with our father , and the other one be no more .        it be just as I say , Joseph persist ; you be spy .      this be how you shall be test : I swear by the life of Pharaoh that you shall not leave here unless your young brother come here .      so send one of your number to get your brother , while the rest of you stay here under arrest . thus will your word be test for their truth ; if they be untrue , as Pharaoh live , you be spy !      with that , he lock they up in the guardhouse for three day .     on the third day Joseph say to they : do this , and you shall live ; for I be a God - fear man .      if you be honest man , let one of your brother be confine in this prison , while the rest of you go and take home grain for your starve family .      but you must bring I your young brother . your word will thus be verify , and you will not die . to this they agree .        to one another , however , they say : truly we be be punish because of our brother . we see the anguish of his heart when he plead with we , yet we would not listen . that be why this anguish have now come upon we .        then Reuben respond , do I not tell you , do no wrong to the boy ? but you would not listen ! now come the reckoning for his blood .        they do not know , of course , that Joseph understand what they say , since he speak with they through an interpreter .      but turn away from they , he weep . when he be able to speak to they again , he take Simeon from among they and bind he before their eye .      then Joseph give order to have their container fill with grain , their money replace in each one sack , and provision give they for their journey . after this have be do for they ,      they load their donkey with the grain and depart .     at the night encampment , when one of they open his bag to give his donkey some fodder , he see his money there in the mouth of his bag .      he cry out to his brother , my money have be return ! here it be in my bag ! at that their heart sink . tremble , they ask one another , what be this that God have do to we ?     when they get back to their father Jacob in the land of Canaan , they tell he all that have happen to they .      the man who be lord of the land , they say , speak to we harshly and put we in custody on the ground that we be spy on the land .      but we say to he : we be honest man ; we have never be spy .      we be twelve brother , son of the same father ; but one be no more , and the young one be now with our father in the land of Canaan .      then the man who be lord of the land say to we : this be how I will know if you be honest man : leave one of your brother with I , then take grain for your starve family and go .      when you bring I your young brother , and I know that you be not spy but honest man , I will restore your brother to you , and you may move about freely in the land .     when they be empty their sack , there in each one sack be his moneybag ! at the sight of their moneybag , they and their father be afraid .      their father Jacob say to they : must you make I childless ? Joseph be no more , Simeon be no more , and now you would take Benjamin away ! all these thing have happen to I !      then Reuben tell his father : you may kill my own two son if I do not return he to you ! put he in my care , and I will bring he back to you .      but Jacob reply : my son shall not go down with you . now that his brother be dead , he be the only one left . if some disaster should befall he on the journey you must make , you would send my white head down to Sheol in grief .
