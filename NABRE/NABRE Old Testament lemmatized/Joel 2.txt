b '    the Day approach    blow the horn in Zion ,   sound the alarm on my holy mountain ! let all the inhabitant of the land tremble ,   for the day of the   Lord   be come !   yes , it approach ,    a day of darkness and gloom ,   a day of thick cloud ! like dawn    spread over the mountain ,   a vast and mighty army ! nothing like it have ever happen in age past ,   nor will the future hold anything like it ,   even to the most distant generation .    before it ,    fire devour ,   behind it flame scorch . the land before it be like the garden of Eden ,   and behind it , a desolate wilderness ;   from it nothing escape .    their appearance be that of horse ;   like war horse they run .   like the rumble of chariot   they hurtle across mountaintop ; like the crackling of fiery flame   devour stubble ; like a massive army   in battle formation .    before they people tremble ,   every face turn pale .    like warrior they run ,   like soldier they scale wall , each advance in line ,   without swerve from the course .   no one crowd the other ;   each advance in its own track ; they plunge through the weapon ;   they be not check .   they charge the city ,   they run upon the wall ,   they climb into the house ; through the window   they enter like thief .     before they the earth tremble ;   the heavens shake ; Sun and moon be darken ,   and the star withhold their brightness .    the   Lord   raise his voice   at the head of his army ; how immense be his host !   how numerous those who carry out his command ! how great be the day of the   Lord !   utterly terrifying ! who can survive it ?     return to the Lord   yet even now\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord \xe2\x80\x94   return to I with your whole heart ,   with fasting , weeping , and mourning .   Rend your heart , not your garment ,   and return to the   Lord , your God , for he be gracious and merciful ,   slow to anger , abound in steadfast love ,   and relent in punishment .    perhaps he will again relent   and leave behind a blessing ,   grain offering and libation   for the   Lord , your God .    blow the horn in Zion !   Proclaim a fast ,   call an assembly !    gather the people ,   sanctify the congregation ; assemble the elderly ;   gather the child ,   even infant nurse at the breast ; let the bridegroom leave his room ,   and the bride    her bridal tent .   between the porch and the altar    let the priest weep ,   let the minister of the   Lord   weep and say : spare your people ,   Lord !   do not let your heritage become a disgrace ,   a byword among the nation ! why should they say among the people ,   where be their God ?     the Lord Relents .     then the   Lord   grow jealous    for his land and take pity on his people .      in response the   Lord   say to his people : I be send you   grain , new wine , and oil ,   and you will be satisfied by they ; never again will I make you   a disgrace among the nation .   the northerner    I will remove far from you ,   drive they out into a dry and desolate land , their vanguard to the eastern sea ,   their rearguard to the western sea , and their stench will rise ,   their stink will ascend , what great deed the Lord have do !   do not fear , o land !   delight and rejoice ,   for the   Lord   have do great thing !    do not fear , you animal in the wild ,   for the wilderness pasture sprout green grass . the tree bear fruit ,   the fig tree and the vine produce their harvest .   child of Zion , delight   and rejoice in the   Lord , your God ! for he have faithfully give you the early rain ,    send rain down on you ,   the early and the late rain as before .    the threshing floor will be full of grain ,   the vat spill over with new wine and oil .   I will repay you double   what the swarm locust have eat , the hopper , the consume locust , and the cutter ,   my great army I send against you .    you will eat until you be fully satisfied ,   then you will praise the name of the   Lord , your God , who act so wondrously on your behalf !   my people will never again be put to shame .   then you will know that I be in the midst of Israel :   I , the   Lord , be your God , and there be no other ;   my people will never again be put to shame .
