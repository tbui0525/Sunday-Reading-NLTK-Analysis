King Solomon be build Millo , close up the breach of the City of David , his father .      Jeroboam be a very able man , and when Solomon see that the young man be also a good worker , he put he in charge of all the carrier conscript from the house of Joseph .     at that time Jeroboam leave Jerusalem , and the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite meet he on the road . the prophet be wear a new cloak ,    and when the two be alone in the open country ,       Ahijah take off his new cloak , tear it into twelve piece ,       and say to Jeroboam : take ten piece for yourself . thus say the   Lord , the God of Israel : I be about to tear the kingdom out of Solomons hand and will give you ten of the tribe .      he shall have one tribe for the sake of my servant David , and for the sake of Jerusalem , the city I have choose out of all the tribe of Israel .      for they have forsake I and have bow down to Astarte , goddess of the Sidonians , Chemosh , god of Moab , and Milcom , god of the Ammonites . they have not walk in my way or do what be right in my eye , accord to my statute and my ordinance , as David his father do .      yet I will not take any of the kingdom from Solomon himself , but will keep he a prince as long as he live , for the sake of David my servant , whom I have choose , who keep my commandment and statute .     but I will take the kingdom from his son hand and give it to you\xe2\x80\x94that be , the ten tribe .      I will give his son one tribe , that David my servant may always have a holding before I in Jerusalem , the city I have choose , to set my name there .      you I will take and you shall reign over all that you desire and shall become king of Israel .      if , then , you heed all that I command you , walk in my way , and do what be right in my eye by keep my statute and my commandment like David my servant , I will be with you . I will build a last house for you , just as I do for David ; I will give Israel to you .      I will humble Davids line for this , but not forever .     when Solomon try to have Jeroboam kill , Jeroboam flee to Shishak , king of Egypt . he remain in Egypt until Solomons death .     the rest of the act of Solomon , with all that he do and his wisdom , be record in the book of the act of Solomon .
