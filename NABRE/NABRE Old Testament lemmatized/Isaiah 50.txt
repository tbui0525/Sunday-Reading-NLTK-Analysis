b '   Salvation through the Lords Servant    thus say the   Lord : where be the bill of divorce   with which I dismiss your mother ?   or to which of my creditor   have I sell you ? it be for your sin you be sell ,   for your rebellion your mother be dismiss .      why be no one there when I come ?   why do no one answer when I call ?   be my hand too short to ransom ?   have I not the strength to deliver ? see , with my rebuke I dry up the sea ,   I turn river into wilderness ; their fish rot for lack of water ,   and die of thirst .    I clothe the heaven in black ,   and make sackcloth their covering .      the Lord   God   have give I   a well - train tongue , that I might know how to answer the weary   a word that will waken they . morning after morning   he waken my ear to hear as disciple do ;   the Lord   God   open my ear ;   I do not refuse ,   do not turn away .    I give my back to those who beat I ,   my cheek to those who tear out my beard ;   my face I do not hide   from insult and spitting .      the Lord   God   be my help ,   therefore I be not disgrace ; therefore I have set my face like flint ,   know that I shall not be put to shame .    he who declare my innocence be near .   who will oppose I ?   let we appear together . who will dispute my right ?   let they confront I .   see , the Lord   God   be my help ;   who will declare I guilty ? see , they will all wear out like a garment ,   consume by moth .    who among you fear the   Lord ,    heed his servant voice ? whoever walk in darkness ,   without any light , yet trust in the name of the   Lord   and rely upon their God !    all you who kindle flame   and set flare alight , walk by the light of your own fire   and by the flare you have burn ! this be your fate from my hand :   you shall lie down in a place of torment .
