b '   Joseph Sold into Egypt .     Jacob settle in the land where his father have sojourn , the land of Canaan .        this be the story of the family of Jacob .    when Joseph be seventeen year old , he be tend the flock with his brother ; he be an assistant to the son of his father wife Bilhah and Zilpah , and Joseph bring their father bad report about they .      Israel love Joseph good of all his son , for he be the child of his old age ; and he have make he a long ornament tunic .        when his brother see that their father love he good of all his brother , they hate he so much that they could not say a kind word to he .      once Joseph have a dream , and when he tell his brother , they hate he even more .        he say to they , listen to this dream I have .      there we be , bind sheaf in the field , when suddenly my sheaf rise to an upright position , and your sheaf form a ring around my sheaf and bow down to it .      his brother say to he , be you really go to make yourself king over we ? will you rule over we ? so they hate he all the more because of his dream and his report .      then he have another dream , and tell it to his brother . look , I have another dream , he say ; this time , the sun and the moon and eleven star be bow down to I .      when he tell it to his father and his brother , his father reprove he and ask , what be the meaning of this dream of your ? can it be that I and your mother and your brother be to come and bow to the ground before you ?      so his brother be furious at he but his father keep the matter in mind .     one day , when his brother have go to pasture their father flock at Shechem ,      Israel say to Joseph , be your brother not tend our flock at Shechem ? come and I will send you to they . I be ready , Joseph answer .      go then , he reply ; see if all be well with your brother and the flock , and bring back word . so he send he off from the valley of Hebron . when Joseph reach Shechem ,      a man come upon he as he be wander about in the field . what be you look for ? the man ask he .      I be look for my brother , he answer . please tell I where they be tend the flock .      the man tell he , they have move on from here ; in fact , I hear they say , let we go on to Dothan . so Joseph go after his brother and find they in Dothan .      they see he from a distance , and before he reach they , they plot to kill he .      they say to one another : here come that dreamer !      come now , let we kill he and throw he into one of the cistern here ; we could say that a wild beast devour he . we will see then what come of his dream .       but when Reuben hear this , he try to save he from their hand , say : we must not take his life .      then Reuben say , do not shed blood ! throw he into this cistern in the wilderness ; but do not lay a hand on he . his purpose be to save he from their hand and restore he to his father .      so when Joseph come up to his brother , they strip he of his tunic , the long ornament tunic he have on ;      then they take he and throw he into the cistern . the cistern be empty ; there be no water in it .     then they sit down to eat . look up , they see a caravan of Ishmaelites come from Gilead , their camel laden with gum , balm , and resin to be take down to Egypt .        Judah say to his brother : what be to be gain by kill our brother and conceal his blood ?        come , let we sell he to these Ishmaelites , instead of do away with he ourselves . after all , he be our brother , our own flesh . his brother agree .     Midianite trader pass by , and they pull Joseph up out of the cistern . they sell Joseph for twenty piece of silver    to the Ishmaelites , who take he to Egypt .        when Reuben go back to the cistern and see that Joseph be not in it , he tear his garment ,        and return to his brother , he exclaim : the boy be go ! and i\xe2\x80\x94where can I turn ?      they take Josephs tunic , and after slaughter a goat , dip the tunic in its blood .      then they send someone to bring the long ornament tunic to their father , with the message : we find this . see whether it be your son tunic or not .      he recognize it and exclaim : my son tunic ! a wild beast have devour he ! Joseph have be tear to piece !        then Jacob tear his garment , put sackcloth on his loin , and mourn his son many day .      though his son and daughter try to console he , he refuse all consolation , say , no , I will go down mourn to my son in Sheol .    thus do his father weep for he .      the Midianites , meanwhile , sell Joseph in Egypt to Potiphar , an official of Pharaoh and his chief steward .
