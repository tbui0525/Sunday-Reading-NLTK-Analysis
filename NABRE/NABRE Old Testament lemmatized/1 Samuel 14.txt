Ahijah , son of Ahitub , brother of Ichabod , the son of Phinehas , son of Eli , the priest of the   Lord   at Shiloh , be wear the ephod\xe2\x80\x94nor do the soldier know that Jonathan have go .        flank the ravine through which Jonathan intend to cross to the philistine outpost be rocky crag on each side , one name Bozez and the other Seneh .      one crag be to the north , toward Michmash ; the other to the south , toward Geba .      Jonathan say to his armor - bearer : come , let we go over to that outpost of the uncircumcised . perhaps the   Lord   will help we , because it be no more difficult for the   Lord   to grant victory by mean of a few than it be by mean of many .        his armor - bearer reply , do whatever you think well ; I be with you in whatever you decide .      Jonathan continue : when we cross over to those man , we will be visible to they .      if they say to we , stay there until we can come to you , we will stop where we be ; we will not go up to they .      but if they say , come up to we , we will go up , because the   Lord   have deliver they into our hand . that will be our sign .         when the two of they come into the view of the philistine outpost , the Philistines remark , look , some Hebrews    be come out of the hole where they have be hide .      the man of the outpost call to Jonathan and his armor - bearer . come up here , they say , and we will teach you a lesson . so Jonathan say to his armor - bearer , Climb up after I , for the   Lord   have deliver they into the hand of Israel .      Jonathan clamber up with his armor - bearer behind he . as the Philistines fall before Jonathan , his armor - bearer , who follow he , would finish they off .      in this first attack Jonathan and his armor - bearer kill about twenty man within half a furlong .      then terror spread through the camp and the countryside ; all the soldier in the outpost and in the raid party shudder in terror . the earth shake with an awesome shuddering .      Rout of the Philistines .     Sauls sentinel in Gibeah of Benjamin see that the enemy camp have scatter and be run in all direction .      Saul say to those around he , count the troop and find out if any of we be miss . when they have take the count , they find Jonathan and his armor - bearer missing .      Saul then say to Ahijah , bring the ephod here . ( Ahijah be wear the ephod before the Israelites at that time . )      while Saul be speak to the priest , the uproar in the philistine camp keep increase . so he say to the priest , withdraw your hand .      and Saul and all his man rally and rush into the fight , where the Philistines , wholly confuse , be thrust sword at one another .        the Hebrews who have previously side with the Philistines and have go up with they to their camp turn to join the Israelites under Saul and Jonathan .        likewise , all the Israelites who be hide in the hill country of Ephraim , hear that the Philistines be flee , keep after they in the battle .         thus the   Lord   save Israel that day . Sauls Oath .   the battle continue past Beth - aven .      even though the Israelites be exhaust that day , Saul lay an oath on they , say , curse be the one who take food before evening , before I be able to avenge myself on my enemy . so none of the people taste food .      now there be a honeycomb lie on the ground ,      and when the soldier come to the comb the honey be flow ; yet no one raise a hand from it to his mouth , because the people fear the oath .    violation of the Oath .     Jonathan , who have not hear that his father have put the people under oath , thrust out the end of the staff he be hold and dip it into the honeycomb . then he raise it to his mouth and his eye brighten .      at this , one of the soldier speak up : your father put the people under a strict oath , say , curse be the one who take food today ! as a result the people be weaken .       Jonathan reply : my father bring trouble to the land . look how bright my eye be because I have this little taste of honey .      what be more , if the army have eat freely of the enemys plunder when they come across it today , surely the slaughter of the Philistines would have be the great by now !    consume the blood .     after the Philistines be route that day from Michmash to Aijalon , the people be completely exhausted .      so the army pounce upon the plunder and take sheep , oxen , and calf , slaughter they on the ground and eat the meat with the blood in it .        inform that the army be sin against the   Lord   by eat the meat with blood in it , Saul say : you have break faith . roll a large stone here for I .      he continue : Mingle with the people and tell each of they , bring an ox or sheep to I . slaughter they here and then eat . but you must not sin against the   Lord   by eat meat with blood in it . so that night they all bring whatever oxen they have seize , and they slaughter they there ;      and Saul build an altar to the   Lord \xe2\x80\x94this be the first time he build an altar to the   Lord .     Jonathan in Danger of Death .     then Saul say , let we go down in pursuit of the Philistines by night , to plunder they until daybreak and leave no one alive . they reply , do what you think well . but the priest say , let we consult God .      so Saul inquire of God : shall I go down in pursuit of the Philistines ? will you deliver they into the hand of Israel ? but he receive no answer on this occasion .        all officer of the army , Saul announce , come forward . find out how this sin be commit today .      as the   Lord   live who have give victory to Israel , even if my son Jonathan have commit it , he shall surely die ! but none of the people answer he .      so he say to all Israel , stand on one side , and my son Jonathan and I will stand on the other . the people respond , do what you think well .        and Saul say to the   Lord , the God of Israel : why do you not answer your servant this time ? if the blame for this reside in I or my son Jonathan ,   Lord , God of Israel , respond with Urim ; but if this guilt be in your people Israel , respond with Thummim .    Jonathan and Saul be designate , and the people go free .        Saul then say , cast lot between I and my son Jonathan . and Jonathan be designate .      Saul say to Jonathan , tell I what you have do . Jonathan reply , I only taste a little honey from the end of the staff I be hold . be I to die for this ?      Saul declare , may God do thus to I , and more , if you do not indeed die , Jonathan !     Rescue of Jonathan .     but the soldier protest to Saul : be Jonathan to die , the man who win this great victory for Israel ? this must not be ! as the   Lord   live , not a single hair of his head shall fall to the ground , for God be with he in what he do today ! thus the soldier rescue    Jonathan and he do not die .        after that Saul give up the pursuit of the Philistines , who return to their own territory .    Sauls Victories .     after take possession of the kingship over Israel , Saul wage war on its enemy all around\xe2\x80\x94Moab , the Ammonites , Edom , the king of Zobah , and the Philistines . wherever he turn , he be successful        and fight bravely . he defeat Amalek and deliver Israel from the hand of those who be plunder they .
