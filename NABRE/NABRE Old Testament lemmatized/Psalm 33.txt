b ' praise of Gods Power and Providence I   rejoice , you righteous , in the   Lord ;   praise from the upright be fitting .    give thank to the   Lord   on the harp ;   on the ten - stringed lyre offer praise .    sing to he a new song ;   skillfully play with joyful chant .   for the   Lord s word be upright ;   all his work be trustworthy .   he love justice and right .   the earth be full of the mercy of the   Lord .     II   by the   Lord s word the heavens be make ;   by the breath of his mouth all their host .      he gather the water of the sea as a mound ;   he set the deep into storage vault .     III   let all the earth fear the   Lord ;   let all who dwell in the world show he reverence .   for he speak , and it come to be ,   command , and it stand in place .    the   Lord   foil the plan of nation ,   frustrate the design of people .   but the plan of the   Lord   stand forever ,   the design of his heart through all generation .    bless be the nation whose God be the   Lord ,   the people choose as his inheritance .     IV   from heaven the   Lord   look down   and observe the child of Adam ,    from his dwelling place he survey   all who dwell on earth .   the one who fashion together their heart   be the one who know all their work .    v   a king be not save by a great army ,   nor a warrior deliver by great strength .   useless be the horse for safety ;   despite its great strength , it can not be save .   behold , the eye of the   Lord   be upon those who fear he ,   upon those who count on his mercy ,   to deliver their soul from death ,   and to keep they alive through famine .    VI   our soul wait for the   Lord ,   he be our help and shield .    for in he our heart rejoice ;   in his holy name we trust .   may your mercy ,   Lord , be upon we ;   as we put our hope in you .
