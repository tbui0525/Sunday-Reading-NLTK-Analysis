b '    the word of the   Lord   which come to Micah of Moresheth in the day of Jotham , Ahaz , and Hezekiah , king of Judah , which he see concern Samaria and Jerusalem .      hear , o people , all of you ,   give heed , o earth , and all that be in it !   let the Lord   God   be witness against you ,   the Lord from his holy temple !    for see , the   Lord   go out from his place    and descend , tread upon the height of the earth .    the mountain melt under he   and the valley split open , like wax before the fire ,   like water pour down a slope .   all this be for the crime of Jacob ,   for the sin of the house of Israel .   what be the crime of Jacob ? be it not Samaria ? and what be the sin of the house of Judah ?   be it not Jerusalem ?   so I will make Samaria a ruin in the field ,   a place to plant vineyard ; I will throw its stone into the valley ,   and lie bare its foundation .    all its carve figure shall be break to piece ,    all its wage shall be burn in the fire ,   and all its idol I will destroy . as the wage of a prostitute    it gather they ,   and to the wage of a prostitute they shall return .      for this I will lament and wail ,   go barefoot and naked ; I will utter lamentation like the jackal ,   mourn like the ostrich ,    for her wound be incurable ;   it have come even to Judah . it have reach to the gate of my people ,   even to Jerusalem .      do not announce it in Gath ,   do not weep at all ; in Beth - leaphrah   roll in the dust .    Pass by ,   you who dwell in Shaphir ! the inhabitant of Zaanan   do not come forth from their city . there be lamentation in Beth - ezel .   it will withdraw its support from you .   the inhabitant of Maroth   hope for good , but evil have come down from the   Lord   to the gate of Jerusalem .   Harness steed to the chariot ,   inhabitant of Lachish ; you be the beginning of sin   for daughter Zion , for in you be find   the crime of Israel .   therefore you must give back the dowry   to Moresheth - gath ; the house of Achzib    be a dry stream bed   to the king of Israel .   again I will bring the conqueror to you ,   inhabitant of Mareshah ; the glory of Israel shall come   even to Adullam .   make yourself bald , cut off your hair ,   for the child whom you cherish ; make yourself bald as a vulture ,   for they be take from you into exile .
