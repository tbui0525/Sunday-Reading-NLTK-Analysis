Moses also say to Korah , Hear , now , you Levites !       be you not satisfied that the God of Israel have single you out from the community of Israel , to have you draw near he to maintain the   Lord s tabernacle , and to attend upon the community and to serve they ?      he have allow you and your Levite kinsman with you to approach he , and yet you seek the priesthood too .      it be therefore against the   Lord   that you and all your faction be conspire . as for Aaron , what have he do that you should grumble against he ?    rebellion of Dathan and Abiram .     Moses summon Dathan and Abiram , son of Eliab , but they answer , we will not go .        be you not satisfied that you have bring we here from a land flow with milk and honey to have we perish in the wilderness , that now you must also lord it over we ?      far from bring we to a land flow with milk and honey , or give we field and vineyard for our inheritance , will you gouge out our eye ?    no , we will not go .     then Moses become very angry and say to the   Lord , pay no attention to their offering . I have never take a single donkey from they , nor have I wrong any one of they .     Korah .     Moses say to Korah , you and all your faction shall appear before the   Lord   tomorrow\xe2\x80\x94you and they and Aaron too .      then each of you take his own censer , put incense in it , and present it before the   Lord , two hundred and fifty censer ; and you and Aaron , each with his own censer , do the same .      so each of they take their censer , and lay incense on the fire they have put in they , they take their stand by the entrance of the tent of meeting along with Moses and Aaron .      then , when Korah have assemble all the community against they at the entrance of the tent of meeting , the glory of the   Lord   appear to the entire community ,      and the   Lord   say to Moses and Aaron :      stand apart from this community , that I may consume they at once .      but they fall prostrate and exclaim , o God , God of the spirit of all living creature , if one man sin will you be angry with the whole community ?      the   Lord   answer Moses :      speak to the community and tell they : withdraw from the area around the tent    of Korah , Dathan and Abiram .    punishment of Dathan and Abiram .     Moses , follow by the elder of Israel , arise and go to Dathan and Abiram .        then he speak to the community , move away from the tent of these wicked man and do not touch anything that be theirs : otherwise you too will be sweep away because of all their sin .      so they withdraw from the area around the tent of Korah , Dathan and Abiram . when Dathan and Abiram have come out and be stand at the entrance of their tent with their wife , their child , and their little one ,      Moses say , this be how you shall know that the   Lord   send I to do all I have do , and that it be not of my own devising :      if these die an ordinary death , merely suffer the fate common to all humanity , the   Lord   have not send I .      but if the   Lord   make a chasm , and the ground open its mouth and swallow they with all belong to they , and they go down alive to Sheol ,    then you will know that these man have spurn the   Lord .       no soon have he finish say all this than the ground beneath they split open ,      and the earth open its mouth and swallow they and their family and all of Korahs people    with all their possession .      they go down alive to sheol with all belong to they ; the earth close over they , and they disappear from the assembly .      but all the Israelites near they flee at their shriek , say , the earth might swallow we too !    punishment of Korah .     and fire from the   Lord   come forth which consume the two hundred and fifty man who be offer the incense .
