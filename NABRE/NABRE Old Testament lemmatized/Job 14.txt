b '    Man bear of woman   be short - live and full of trouble ,     like a flower that spring up and fade ,    swift as a shadow that do not abide .   upon such a one will you set your eye ,   bring I into judgment before you ?   can anyone make the unclean clean ?    no one can .   since his day be determined\xe2\x80\x94   you know the number of his month ;   you have fix the limit which he can not pass\xe2\x80\x94   look away from he and let he be ,   while , like a hireling , he complete his day .   for a tree there be hope ;   if it be cut down , it will sprout again ,   its tender shoot will not cease .   even though its root grow old in the earth   and its stump die in the dust ,   yet at the first whiff of water it sprout   and put forth branch like a young plant .   but when a man die , all vigor leave he ;    when a mortal expire , where then be he ?   as when the water of a lake fail ,   or a stream shrivel and dry up ,   so mortal lie down , never to rise .   until the heavens be no more , they shall not awake ,   nor be rouse out of their sleep .    oh , that you would hide I in Sheol ,   shelter I till your wrath be past ,   fix a time to remember I !   if a man be to die , and live again ,   all the day of my drudgery I would wait    for my relief to come .   you would call , and I would answer you ;   you would long for the work of your hand .   surely then you would count my step ,    and not keep watch for sin in I .   my misdeed would be seal up in a pouch ,    and you would cover over my guilt .   mountain fall and crumble ,   rock move from their place ,   and water wear away stone ,   and flood wash away the soil of the land\xe2\x80\x94   so you destroy the hope of mortal !   you prevail once for all against they and they pass on ;   you dismiss they with changed appearance .   if their child be honor , they be not aware of it ;   or if disgrace , they do not know about they .   only for themselves , their pain ;   only for themselves , their mourning .
