b '   the Corruption of the People   oh , that I have in the wilderness   a traveler lodge ! that I might leave my people   and depart from they . they be all adulterer ,   a band of traitor .   they ready their tongue like a draw bow ;   with lying , and not with truth ,   they be powerful in the land . they go from evil to evil ,   and I they do not know\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord .   be on your guard , everyone against his neighbor ;   put no trust in any brother . every brother imitate Jacob , the supplanter ,    every neighbor be guilty of slander .   each one deceive the other ,   no one speak the truth . they have accustom their tongue to lie ,   they be perverse and can not repent .    violence upon violence ,   deceit upon deceit : they refuse to know me\xe2\x80\x94   oracle of the   Lord .   therefore , thus say the   Lord   of host : I will refine they and test they ;   how else should I deal with the daughter of my people ?   a murderous arrow be their tongue ,   their mouth utter deceit ; they speak peaceably with their neighbor ,   but in their heart they lie an ambush !    should I not punish they for these deeds\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord ;   on a nation such as this should I not take vengeance ?     Dirge over the Ravaged Land   over the mountain I shall break out in cry of lamentation ,   over the pasture in the wilderness , in a dirge : they be scorch , and no one cross they ,   no sound of low cattle ; bird of the air as well as beast ,   all have flee and be go .    I will turn Jerusalem into a heap of ruin ,   a haunt of jackal ; the city of Judah I will make a waste ,   where no one dwell .      who be wise enough to understand this ? to whom have the mouth of the   Lord   speak ? let he declare it ! why be the land ravage ,   scorch like a wilderness no one crosse ?      the   Lord   say : because they have abandon my law , which I set before they , and do not listen to I or follow it ,      but follow instead their stubborn heart and the baal , as their ancestor have teach they ,        therefore , thus say the   Lord   of host , the God of Israel : see now , I will give this people wormwood to eat and poison water to drink .        I will scatter they among nation whom neither they nor their ancestor have know ; I will send the sword to pursue they until I have completely destroy they .       thus say the   Lord   of host : inquire , and call the wail woman to come ;   summon the most skilled of they .   let they come quickly   and raise for we a dirge , that our eye may run with tear ,   our pupil flow with water .    the sound of the dirge be hear from Zion :   we be ruin and greatly ashamed ; we have leave the land ,   give up our dwelling !   hear , you woman , the word of the   Lord ,   let your ear receive the word of his mouth . teach your daughter a dirge ,   and each other a lament :   death have come up through our window ,   have enter our citadel , to cut down child in the street ,   young people in the square .    corpse shall fall   like dung in the open field , like sheaf behind the harvester ,   with no one to gather they .    true Glory    thus say the   Lord : let not the wise boast of his wisdom ,   nor the strong boast of his strength ,   nor the rich man boast of his rich ;   but rather , let those who boast , boast of this ,   that in their prudence they know I ,   know that I , the   Lord , act with fidelity ,   justice , and integrity on earth . how I take delight in these\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord .    false Circumcision .     see , day be coming\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord \xe2\x80\x94when I will demand an account of all those circumcise in the foreskin :        Egypt and Judah , Edom and the Ammonites , Moab , and those who live in the wilderness and shave their temple .    for all the nation be uncircumcised , even the whole house of Israel be uncircumcised at heart .
