b '    Salvation for the just      thus say the   Lord : observe what be right , do what be just ,   for my salvation be about to come ,   my justice , about to be reveal .    Happy be the one who do this ,   whoever hold fast to it : keep the sabbath without profane it ,   keep one hand from do any evil .     Obligations and promise to share in the Covenant    the foreigner join to the   Lord   should not say ,   the   Lord   will surely exclude I from his people ; nor should the eunuch say ,   see , I be a dry tree .     for thus say the   Lord : to the eunuch who keep my sabbath ,   who choose what please I ,   and who hold fast to my covenant ,    I will give they , in my house   and within my wall , a monument and a name   well than son and daughter ;   an eternal name , which shall not be cut off , will I give they .   and foreigner who join themselves to the   Lord ,   to minister to he , to love the name of the   Lord ,   to become his servants\xe2\x80\x94 all who keep the sabbath without profane it   and hold fast to my covenant ,    they I will bring to my holy mountain   and make they joyful in my house of prayer ; their burn offering and their sacrifice   will be acceptable on my altar , for my house shall be call   a house of prayer for all people .     Oracle of the Lord   God ,   who gather the disperse of Israel\xe2\x80\x94 other will I gather to they   besides those already gather .     Unworthy Shepherds    all you beast of the field ,    come to devour ,   all you beast in the forest !     all the sentinel of Israel be blind ,   they be without knowledge ; they be all mute dog ,   unable to bark ; dreaming , recline ,   love their sleep .   yes , the dog have a ravenous appetite ;   they never know satiety , Shepherds who have no understanding ;   all have turn their own way ,   each one covetous for gain :   come , let I bring wine ;   let we fill ourselves with strong drink , and tomorrow will be like today ,   or even great .
