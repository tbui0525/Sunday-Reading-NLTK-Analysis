b '    the   Lord   speak to Moses : go ! you and the people whom you have bring up from the land of Egypt be to go up from here to the land about which I swear to Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob : I will give it to your descendant .        drive out the Canaanites , Amorites , Hittites , Perizzites , Hivites and Jebusites , I will send an angel before you        to a land flow with milk and honey . but I myself will not go up in your company , because you be a stiff - necked people ; otherwise I might consume you on the way .      when the people hear this painful news , they mourn , and no one wear any ornament .     the   Lord   speak to Moses : speak to the Israelites : you be a stiff - necked people . be I to go up in your company even for a moment , I would destroy you . now off with your ornament ! let I think what to do with you .      so , from Mount Horeb onward , the Israelites strip off their ornament .    Moses Intimacy with God .     Moses use to pitch a tent    outside the camp at some distance . it be call the tent of meeting . anyone who wish to consult the   Lord   would go to the tent of meeting outside the camp .      whenever Moses go out to the tent , the people would all rise and stand at the entrance of their own tent , watch Moses until he enter the tent .      as Moses enter the tent , the column of cloud would come down and stand at its entrance while the   Lord   speak with Moses .      on see the column of cloud stand at the entrance of the tent , all the people would rise and bow down at the entrance of their own tent .      the   Lord   use to speak to Moses face to face ,    as a person speak to a friend . Moses would then return to the camp , but his young assistant , Joshua , son of Nun , never leave the tent .      Moses say to the   Lord , see , you be tell I : lead this people .    but you have not let I know whom you will send with I . yet you have say : you be my intimate friend ;    you have find favor with I .      now , if I have find favor with you , please let I know your way so that , in know you , I may continue to find favor with you . see , this nation be indeed your own people .      the   Lord   answer : I myself    will go along , to give you rest .      Moses reply , if you be not go yourself , do not make we go up from here .      for how can it be know that I and your people have find favor with you , except by your go with we ? then we , your people and I , will be single out from every other people on the surface of the earth .      the   Lord   say to Moses : this request , too , which you have make , I will carry out , because you have find favor with I and you be my intimate friend .     then Moses say , please let I see your glory !      the   Lord   answer : I will make all my goodness pass before you , and I will proclaim my name ,   Lord , before you ; I who show favor to whom I will , I who grant mercy to whom I will .        but you can not see my face ,    for no one can see I and live .        here , continue the   Lord , be a place near I where you shall station yourself on the rock .      when my glory pass I will set you in the cleft of the rock and will cover you with my hand until I have pass by .      then I will remove my hand , so that you may see my back ; but my face may not be see .
