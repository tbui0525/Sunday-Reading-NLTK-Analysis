b ' the Divine Ruler of all I   the   Lord   be king ; let the earth rejoice ;   let the many island be glad .    Cloud and darkness surround he ;   justice and right be the foundation of his throne .    Fire go before he ,   consume his foe on every side .   his lighten illumine the world ;   the earth see and tremble .    the mountain melt like wax before the   Lord ,   before the Lord of all the earth .    the heavens proclaim his justice ;   all people see his glory .     II   all who serve idol be put to shame ,   who glory in worthless thing ;   all god    bow down before he .    Zion hear and be glad ,   and the daughter of Judah rejoice   because of your judgment , o   Lord .    for you ,   Lord , be the most high over all the earth ,    exalt far above all god .   you who love the   Lord , hate evil ,   he protect the soul of the faithful ,    rescue they from the hand of the wicked .   light dawn for the just ,   and gladness for the honest of heart .    rejoice in the   Lord , you just ,   and give thank at the remembrance of his holiness .
