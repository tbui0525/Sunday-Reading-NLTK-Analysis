b '   Jonathan become High Priest .     in the one hundred and sixtieth year ,    Alexander Epiphanes , son of Antiochus , come up and take Ptolemais . they accept he as king and he begin to reign there .      when King Demetrius hear of it , he muster a very large army and march out to engage he in battle .      Demetrius send a letter to Jonathan write in peaceful term , to exalt he ;      for he say : let we be the first to make peace with he , before he make peace with Alexander against we ,      since he will remember all the wrong we have do to he , his brother , and his nation .     so Demetrius authorize he to gather an army and procure arm as his ally ; and he order that the hostage in the citadel be release to he .      accordingly Jonathan go to Jerusalem and read the letter to all the people and to those who be in the citadel .      they be strike with fear when they hear that the king have give he authority to gather an army .      those in the citadel release the hostage to Jonathan , and he give they back to their parent .        thereafter Jonathan dwelt in Jerusalem , and begin to build and restore the city .      he order those do the work to build the wall and to encircle Mount Zion with square stone for its fortification , and they do so .      the foreigner in the stronghold that Bacchides have build take flight ;      all of they leave their place and return to their own land .      only in Beth - zur do some remain of those who have abandon the law and the commandment , for it be a place of refuge .     King Alexander hear of the promise that Demetrius have make to Jonathan ; he be also tell of the battle and brave deed of Jonathan and his brother and of the trouble that they have endure .      he say , shall we ever find another man like he ? let we now make he our friend and ally .      so he send Jonathan a letter write in these term :      King Alexander send greeting to his brother Jonathan .      we have hear of you , that you be a mighty warrior and worthy to be our friend .      we have therefore appoint you today to be high priest of your nation ; you be to be call the king Friend , and you be to look after our interest and preserve friendship with we . he also send he a purple robe and a crown of gold .        Jonathan put on the sacred vestment in the seventh month of the one hundred and sixtieth year at the feast of booth ,    and he gather an army and procure many weapon .    a Letter from Demetrius to Jonathan .     when Demetrius hear of these thing , he be distressed and say :      why have we allow Alexander to get ahead of we by gain the friendship of the Jews and thus strengthen himself ?      I too will write they encourage word and offer honor and gift , so that they may support I .      so he send they this message : King Demetrius send greeting to the jewish nation .      we have hear how you have keep the treaty with we and continue in our friendship and not go over to our enemy , and we be glad .      continue , therefore , to keep faith with we , and we will reward you with favor in return for what you do in our behalf .      we will grant you many exemption and will bestow gift on you .      I now free you and exempt all the Jews from the tribute , the salt tax , and the crown levy .      instead of collect the third of the grain and the half of the fruit of the tree that should be my share , I renounce the right from this day forward . neither now nor in the future will I collect they from the land of Judah or from the three district annex from Samaria .        let Jerusalem and her territory , her tithe and her toll , be sacred and free from tax .      I also yield my authority over the citadel in Jerusalem , and I transfer it to the high priest , that he may put in it such man as he shall choose to guard it .      every Jew who have be carry into captivity from the land of Judah into any part of my kingdom I set at liberty without ransom ; and let all their taxis , even those on their cattle , be cancel .     let all feast day , sabbath , new moon festival , appoint day , and the three day that precede each feast day , and the three day that follow , be day of immunity and exemption for all Jews in my kingdom .      no one will have authority to exact payment from they or to harass any of they in any matter .     let thirty thousand Jews be enrol in the king army and allowance be give they , as be due to all the king soldier .      let some of they be station in the king principal stronghold , and of these let some be give position of trust in the affair of the kingdom . let their superior and their ruler be choose from among they , and let they follow their own law , as the king have command in the land of Judah .     let the three district that have be add to Judea from the province of Samaria be annex to Judea so that they may be under one rule and obey no other authority than the high priest .      Ptolemais and its confine I give as a present to the sanctuary in Jerusalem for the necessary expense of the sanctuary .      I make a yearly personal grant of fifteen thousand silver shekel out of the royal revenue , take from appropriate place .      all the additional fund that the official do not hand over as they have do in the first year shall henceforth be hand over for the service of the temple .      moreover , the due of five thousand silver shekel that use to be take from the revenue of the sanctuary every year shall be cancel , since these fund belong to the priest who perform the service .      all who take refuge in the temple of Jerusalem or in any of its precinct , because of money they owe the king , or because of any other debt , shall be release , together with all the good they possess in my kingdom .      the cost of rebuild and restore the structure of the sanctuary shall be cover out of the royal revenue .      likewise the cost of build the wall of Jerusalem and fortify it all around , and of building wall in Judea , shall be donate from the royal revenue .     when Jonathan and the people hear these word , they neither believe nor accept they , for they remember the great evil that Demetrius have do in Israel , and the great tribulation he have bring upon they .      they therefore decide in favor of Alexander , for he have be the first to address they peaceably , and they remain his ally for the rest of his life .     then King Alexander gather together a large army and encamp opposite Demetrius .      the two king join battle , and when the army of Demetrius flee , Alexander pursue he , and overpower his soldier .      he press the battle hard until sunset , and Demetrius fall that day .    Treaty of Ptolemy and Alexander .     Alexander send ambassador to Ptolemy , king of Egypt , with this message :      now that I have return to my realm , take my seat on the throne of my ancestor , and establish my rule by crush Demetrius and gain control of my country\xe2\x80\x94      for I engage he in battle , he and his army be crush by we , and we assume his royal throne\xe2\x80\x94      let we now establish friendship with each other . give I now your daughter for my wife ; and as your son - in - law , I will give to you and to her gift worthy of you .     King Ptolemy answer in these word : happy the day on which you return to the land of your ancestor and take your seat on their royal throne !      I will do for you what you have write ; but meet I in Ptolemais , so that we may see each other , and I will become your father - in - law as you have propose .     so Ptolemy with his daughter Cleopatra    set out from Egypt and come to Ptolemais in the one hundred and sixty - second year .      there King Alexander meet he , and Ptolemy give he his daughter Cleopatra in marriage . their wedding be celebrate at Ptolemais with great splendor accord to the custom of king .     King Alexander also write to Jonathan to come and meet he .      so he go with pomp to Ptolemais , where he meet the two king and give they and their friend silver and gold and many gift and thus win their favor .        some villainous man of Israel , transgressor of the law , unite against he to accuse he , but the king pay no heed to they .      the king order Jonathan to be divest of his garment and to be clothe in royal purple ; and so it be do .      the king also have he seat at his side . he say to his magistrate : go with he to the center of the city and make a proclamation that no one be to bring charge against he on any ground or be troublesome to he for any reason .       when his accuser see the honor pay to he accord to the king proclamation , and he clothe in purple , they all flee .      and so the king honor he , enrol he among his Chief Friends , and he make he governor and chief of the province .      so Jonathan return in peace and happiness to Jerusalem .    Jonathan defeat Apollonius .     in the one hundred and sixty - fifth year ,    Demetrius , son of Demetrius , come from Crete to the land of his ancestor .      when King Alexander hear of it he be greatly troubled , and return to Antioch .      Demetrius set Apollonius over Coelesyria .    having gather a large army , Apollonius encamp at Jamnia . from there he send this message to Jonathan the high priest :     you be the only one who resist we . I be laugh at and put to shame on your account . why be you exercise authority against we in the mountain ?      if you have confidence in your force , come down now to we in the plain , and let we test each other strength there ; for the force of the city be on my side .      inquire and find out who I be and who the other be who be help I . People be say that you can not make a stand against we because your ancestor be twice put to flight    in their own land .      now you too will be unable to withstand our cavalry and such a force as this in the plain , where there be not a stone or a pebble or a place to flee .     when Jonathan hear the message of Apollonius , he be provoke . choose ten thousand man , he set out from Jerusalem , and Simon his brother join he to help he .      he encamp near Joppa , but the people of the city shut he out because Apollonius have a garrison in Joppa . when they attack it ,      the people of the city become afraid and open the gate , and so Jonathan take possession of Joppa .      when Apollonius hear of it , he draw up three thousand cavalry and a large force of infantry . he march toward Azotus as though he be go on through , but at the same time he be advance into the plain , because he have such a large number of cavalry to rely on .      Jonathan pursue he toward Azotus , and the army engage in battle .      Apollonius , however , have leave a thousand cavalry in hide behind they .      Jonathan discover that there be an ambush behind he ; his army be surround . from morning until evening they shower his troop with arrow .      but his troop hold their ground , as Jonathan have command , while the enemys horse become tired out .     then Simon bring forward his force , and engage the phalanx in battle . since the cavalry be exhaust , the phalanx be crush by he and flee ,      while the cavalry too be scatter over the plain . they flee to Azotus and enter Beth - dagon , the temple of their idol , to save themselves .      but Jonathan burn and plunder Azotus with its neighboring town , and destroy by fire both the temple of Dagon and those who have take refuge in it .        those who fall by the sword , together with those who be burn alive , come to about eight thousand .     then Jonathan leave there and encamp at Askalon , and the people of that city come out to meet he with great pomp .      Jonathan and those with he then return to Jerusalem , with much spoil .      when King Alexander hear of these event , he accord new honor to Jonathan .      he send he a gold buckle , such as be usually give to Kings Kinsmen ;    he also give he Ekron and all its territory as a possession .
