b '   transfer of the Ark.      after David have take counsel with his commander of thousand and of hundred , that is , with every leader ,      he say to the whole assembly of Israel : if it seem good to you , and be so decree by the   Lord   our God , let we send to the rest of our kindred from all the district of Israel , and also the priest and the Levites from their city with pasture land , that they may join we ;        and let we bring the ark of our God here among we , for in the day of Saul we do not consult it .      and the whole assembly agree to do it , for it seem right in the eye of all the people .     then David assemble all Israel , from Shihor of Egypt    to Lebo - hamath , to bring the ark of God from Kiriath - jearim .        David and all Israel go up to Baalah , that is , to Kiriath - jearim , of Judah , to bring up from there the ark of God , which be know by the name   Lord   enthrone upon the cherubim .        they transport the ark of God on a new cart from the house of Abinadab ; Uzzah and Ahio be guide the cart ,      while David and all Israel dance before God with all their might , with singing , and with lyre , harp , tambourine , cymbal , and trumpet .     as they reach the threshing floor of Chidon ,    Uzzah stretch out his hand to steady the ark , for the oxen be tip it .      then the   Lord   become angry with Uzzah and strike he , because he have lay his hand on the ark ; he die there in Gods presence .      David be angry because the   Lord s anger have break out against Uzzah . therefore that place have be call Perez - uzzah    even to this day .     David be afraid of God that day , and he say , how can I bring in the ark of God to I ?      therefore he do not take the ark with he into the City of David , but deposit it instead at the house of Obed - edom the Gittite .      the ark of God remain in the house of Obed - edom with his family for three month , and the   Lord   bless Obed - edom household and all that he possess .
