b '   Lament over Pharaoh .     on the first day of the twelfth month in the twelfth year ,    the word of the   Lord   come to I :      Son of man , utter a lament over Pharaoh , the king of Egypt , and say to he : you liken yourself to a lion among nation ,   but you be like the monster in the sea ! thrash about in your stream ,   churn the water with your foot ,   pollute the stream .    thus say the Lord   God : I will cast my net over you   by assemble many army ,   and I will hoist you up in my mesh .   I will hurl you onto the land ,   cast you into an open field . I will make all the bird of the sky   roost upon you , the beast of the whole earth   gorge themselves on you .   I will strew your flesh on the mountain ,   and fill the valley with your corpse .    I will drench the land ,   pour out your blood on the mountain ;   fill up the ravine with you .   when I extinguish you ,   I will cover the heaven   and darken all its star . the sun I will cover with cloud ;   the moon will not give light .    all the shine light in the heaven   I will darken over you ; I will spread darkness over your land\xe2\x80\x94   oracle of the Lord   God .   I will trouble the heart   of many people , when I bring you captive   among the nation ,   to land you do not know .   I will fill many nation with horror ;   their king will shudder at you ,   when I brandish my sword in their face . they will tremble violently   fear for their life on the day of your fall .    for thus say the Lord   God : the sword of the king of Babylon   will come against you .   I will cut down your horde   with the sword of warrior ,   all of they , ruthless nation ; they will lay waste the glory of Egypt ,   and all its horde will be destroy .    I will wipe out all the livestock   from the bank of its many water ; no human foot will disturb they again ,   no animal hoof stir they up .   then I will make their water clear   and their stream flow like oil\xe2\x80\x94   oracle of the Lord   God .   when I make Egypt a wasteland   and the land destitute of everything , when I strike down all its inhabitant   they shall know that I be the   Lord .   this be the lamentation   woman of all nation will chant ; they will raise it over Egypt ;   over all its horde they will chant it\xe2\x80\x94   oracle of the Lord   God .    another Lament over Egypt .      on the fifteenth day of that month in the twelfth year , the word of the   Lord   come to I :     Son of man , wail over the horde of Egypt\xe2\x80\x94   you and the woman of mighty nations\xe2\x80\x94 send they down to the underworld ,   with those who go down into the pit .   whom do you excel in beauty ? go down !   be lay to rest with the uncircumcised !   among those slay by the sword they will fall ,   for the sword have be appoint ! seize Egypt and all its horde .    out of Sheol the mighty warrior   will speak to he and his ally : let they descend and lie down among the uncircumcised ,   those slay by the sword !    there be Assyria and all its company ,   around it be its grave ,   all of they slay , fall by the sword .   the grave be set   in the recess of the pit ; its company be assemble   around its grave , all of they slay , fall by the sword ,   those who spread terror in the land of the living .    there be Elam and all its horde   around its grave , all of they slay , fall by the sword ;   they descend uncircumcised   into the underworld , those who spread their terror   in the land of the living . they bear their disgrace   with those who go down into the pit .   among the slain be set its bed ,   with all its horde around its grave ; all of they uncircumcised ,   slay by the sword because of the terror they spread   in the land of the living . they bear their disgrace   with those who go down into the pit .   among the slain it be set !   there be Meshech and Tubal    and all the horde   surround it with their grave . all of they uncircumcised ,   slay by the sword because they spread their terror   in the land of the living .    they do not rest with the warrior   who fall in ancient time ,   who go down to Sheol fully armed . their sword be place under their head   and their shield lay over their bone ; for there be terror of these warrior   in the land of the living .   but as for you , among the uncircumcised   you will be break and lay to rest   with those slay by the sword .   there be Edom , all its king and prince ,   who , despite their might ,   be put with those slay by the sword . they lie among the uncircumcised ,   with those who go down into the pit .    there be the general of the north   and all the Sidonians who have go down with the slain ,   because of the terror their might inspire . they lie uncircumcised   with those slay by the sword , and bear their shame with those   who have go down into the pit .    when Pharaoh see they ,   he will be console on behalf of all his horde ,   slay by the sword\xe2\x80\x94 Pharaoh and all his army\xe2\x80\x94   oracle of the Lord   God .
