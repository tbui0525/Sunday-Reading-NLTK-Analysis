b '   Nebuchadnezzars Madness .     I , Nebuchadnezzar , be at home in my palace , content and prosperous .      I have a terrifying dream as I lie in bed , and the image and my vision frighten I .      so I issue a decree that all the wise man of Babylon should be bring before I to give the interpretation of the dream .      when the magician , enchanter , Chaldeans , and diviner have come in , I relate the dream before they ; but none of they could tell I its meaning .      finally there come before I Daniel , whose name be Belteshazzar after the name of my god ,    and in whom be a spirit of the holy god .    I repeat the dream to he :      Belteshazzar , chief of the magician , I know that a spirit of the holy god be in you and no mystery be too difficult for you ; this be the dream that I see , tell I its meaning .     these be the vision I see while in bed : I see a tree of great height at the center of the earth .      it be large and strong , with its top touch the heaven , and it could be see to the end of the earth .      its leave be beautiful , its fruit abundant , provide food for all . under it the wild beast find shade , in its branch the bird of the air nest ; all flesh eat of it .      in the vision I see while in bed , a holy watcher    come down from heaven      and cry aloud in these word : cut down the tree and lop off its branch ,   strip off its leave and scatter its fruit ; let the beast flee from beneath it , and the bird from its branch ,    but leave its stump in the earth . bind with iron and bronze ,   let he be feed with the grass of the field   and bathe with the dew of heaven ;   let his lot be with the beast in the grass of the earth .   let his mind be change from a human one ;   let the mind of a beast be give he ,   till seven year pass over he .   by decree of the watcher be this proclamation ,   by order of the holy one , this sentence ; that all who live may know   that the most High be sovereign over human kingship , give it to whom he will ,   and set it over the lowly of mortal .      this be the dream that I , King Nebuchadnezzar , have . now , Belteshazzar , tell I its meaning . none of the wise man in my kingdom can tell I the meaning , but you can , because the spirit of the holy god be in you .     then Daniel , whose name be Belteshazzar , be appal for a time , dismay by his thought . Belteshazzar , the king say to he , do not let the dream or its meaning dismay you . my lord , Belteshazzar reply , may this dream be for your enemy , and its meaning for your foe .      the tree that you see , large and strong , its top touch the heaven , that could be see by the whole earth ,      its leave beautiful , its fruit abundant , provide food for all , under which the wild beast live , and in whose branch the bird of the air dwelt\xe2\x80\x94      you be that tree , o king , large and strong ! your majesty have become so great as to touch the heaven , and your rule reach to the end of the earth .      as for the king vision of a holy watcher , who come down from heaven and proclaim : cut down the tree and destroy it , but leave its stump in the earth . bind with iron and bronze , let he be feed with the grass of the field , and bathe with the dew of heaven ; let his lot be with wild beast till seven year pass over him\xe2\x80\x94      here be its meaning , o king , here be the sentence that the most High have pass upon my lord king :       you shall be cast out from human society and dwell with wild beast ; you shall be give grass to eat like an ox and be bathe with the dew of heaven ; seven year shall pass over you , until you know that the most High be sovereign over human kingship and give it to whom he will .      the command that the stump of the tree be to be leave mean that your kingdom shall be preserve for you , once you have learn that heaven be sovereign .      therefore , o king , may my advice be acceptable to you ; atone for your sin by good deed ,    and for your misdeed by kindness to the poor ; then your contentment will be long lasting .     all this happen to King Nebuchadnezzar .      twelve month later , as he be walk on the roof of the royal palace in Babylon ,      the king say , Babylon the great ! be it not I , with my great strength , who build it as a royal residence for my splendor and majesty ?      while these word be still on the king lip , a voice speak from heaven , it have be decree for you , King Nebuchadnezzar , that your kingship be take from you !      you shall be cast out from human society , and shall dwell with wild beast ; you shall be give grass to eat like an ox , and seven year shall pass over you , until you learn that the most High be sovereign over human kingship and give it to whom he will .       at once this be fulfil . Nebuchadnezzar be cast out from human society , he eat grass like an ox , and his body be bathe with the dew of heaven , until his hair grow like the feather of an eagle , and his nail like the claw of a bird .     when this period be over , I , Nebuchadnezzar , raise my eye to heaven ; my reason be restore to I , and I bless the most high , I praise and glorify the one who live forever , whose dominion be an everlasting dominion ,   and whose kingdom endure through all generation .    all who live on the earth be count as nothing ;   he do as he will with the power of heaven   and with those who live on the earth . there be no one who can stay his hand   or say to he , what have you do ?     at the same time my reason return to I , and for the glory of my kingdom , my majesty and my splendor return to I . my counselor and noble seek I out ; I be restore to my kingdom and become much great than before .      now , I , Nebuchadnezzar , praise and exalt and glorify the King of heaven , all of whose work be right and way just ; and who be able to humble those who walk in pride .
