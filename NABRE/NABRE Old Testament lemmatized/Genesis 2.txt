b '    thus the heaven and the earth and all their array be complete .         on the seventh day God complete the work he have be do ; he rest on the seventh day from all the work he have undertake .        God bless the seventh day and make it holy , because on it he rest from all the work he have do in creation .      the Garden of Eden .     this be the story    of the heavens and the earth at their creation . when the   Lord   God make the earth and the heavens\xe2\x80\x94      there be no field shrub on earth and no grass of the field have sprout , for the   Lord   God have send no rain upon the earth and there be no man    to till the ground ,      but a stream    be well up out of the earth and water all the surface of the ground\xe2\x80\x94      then the   Lord   God form the man    out of the dust of the ground and blow into his nostril the breath of life , and the man become a living being .      the   Lord   God plant a garden in Eden , in the east ,    and place there the man whom he have form .         out of the ground the   Lord   God make grow every tree that be delightful to look at and good for food , with the tree of life in the middle of the garden and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil .      a river rise in Eden    to water the garden ; beyond there it divide and become four branch .      the name of the first be the Pishon ; it be the one that wind through the whole land of Havilah , where there be gold .      the gold of that land be good ; bdellium and lapis lazuli be also there .      the name of the second river be the Gihon ; it be the one that wind all through the land of Cush .        the name of the third river be the Tigris ; it be the one that flow east of Asshur . the fourth river be the Euphrates .     the   Lord   God then take the man and settle he in the garden of Eden , to cultivate and care for it .        the   Lord   God give the man this order : you be free to eat from any of the tree of the garden        except the tree of knowledge of good and evil . from that tree you shall not eat ; when you eat from it you shall die .       the   Lord   God say : it be not good for the man to be alone . I will make a helper suit to he .         so the   Lord   God form out of the ground all the wild animal and all the bird of the air , and he bring they to the man to see what he would call they ; whatever the man call each live creature be then its name .      the man give name to all the tame animal , all the bird of the air , and all the wild animal ; but none prove to be a helper suit to the man .     so the   Lord   God cast a deep sleep on the man , and while he be asleep , he take out one of his rib and close up its place with flesh .        the   Lord   God then build the rib that he have take from the man into a woman . when he bring she to the man ,      the man say : this one , at last , be bone of my bone   and flesh of my flesh ; this one shall be call woman ,   for out of man this one have be take .       that be why a man leave his father and mother and cling to his wife , and the two of they become one body .      the man and his wife be both naked , yet they feel no shame .
