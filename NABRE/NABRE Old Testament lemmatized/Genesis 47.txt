b '   Settlement in Goshen .     Joseph go and tell Pharaoh , my father and my brother have come from the land of Canaan , with their flock and herd and everything else they own ; and they be now in the region of Goshen .      he then present to Pharaoh five of his brother whom he have select from their full number .      when Pharaoh ask they , what be your occupation ? they answer , we , your servant , like our ancestor , be shepherd .      we have come , they continue , in order to sojourn in this land , for there be no pasture for your servant flock , because the famine have be severe in the land of Canaan . so now please let your servant settle in the region of Goshen .        Pharaoh say to Joseph , now that your father and your brother have come to you ,      the land of Egypt be at your disposal ; settle your father and brother in the pick of the land . let they settle in the region of Goshen . and if you know of capable man among they , put they in charge of my livestock .      then Joseph bring his father Jacob and present he to Pharaoh . and Jacob bless Pharaoh .      then Pharaoh ask Jacob , how many year have you live ?      Jacob reply : the year I have live as a wayfarer amount to a hundred and thirty . few and hard have be these year of my life , and they do not compare with the year that my ancestor live as wayfarer .        then Jacob bless Pharaoh and withdraw from his presence .     Joseph settle his father and brother and give they a holding in Egypt on the pick of the land , in the region of Rameses ,    as Pharaoh have order .      and Joseph provide food for his father and brother and his father whole household , down to the young .    Josephs Land Policy .     since there be no food in all the land because of the extreme severity of the famine , and the land of Egypt and Canaan be languish from hunger ,      Joseph gather in , as payment for the grain that they be buy , all the money that be to be find in Egypt and Canaan , and he put it in Pharaohs house .      when all the money in Egypt and Canaan be spend , all the Egyptians come to Joseph , plead , give we food ! why should we perish in front of you ? for our money be go .      give I your livestock if your money be go , reply Joseph . I will give you food in return for your livestock .      so they bring their livestock to Joseph , and he give they food in exchange for their horse , their flock of sheep and herd of cattle , and their donkey . thus he supply they with food in exchange for all their livestock in that year .      that year end , and they come to he in the next one and say : we can not hide from my lord that , with our money spend and our livestock make over to my lord , there be nothing leave to put at my lord disposal except our body and our land .      why should we and our land perish before your very eye ? take we and our land in exchange for food , and we will become Pharaohs slave and our land his property ; only give we seed , that we may survive and not perish , and that our land may not turn into a waste .     so Joseph acquire all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh . each of the Egyptians sell his field , since the famine weigh heavily upon they . thus the land pass over to Pharaoh ,      and the people be reduce to slavery , from one end of Egypts territory to the other .      only the priest land Joseph do not acquire . since the priest have a fix allowance from Pharaoh and live off the allowance Pharaoh have grant they , they do not have to sell their land .     Joseph tell the people : now that I have acquire you and your land for Pharaoh , here be your seed for sow the land .      but when the harvest be in , you must give a fifth of it to Pharaoh , while you keep four - fifth as seed for your field and as food for yourself and your household and as food for your child .      you have save our life ! they answer . we have find favor with my lord ; now we will be Pharaohs slave .      thus Joseph make it a statute for the land of Egypt , which be still in force , that a fifth of its produce should go to Pharaoh . only the land of the priest do not pass over to Pharaoh .    Israel Blesses Ephraim and Manasseh .     thus Israel settle in the land of Egypt , in the region of Goshen . there they acquire holding , be fertile , and multiply greatly .         Jacob live in the land of Egypt for seventeen year ; the span of his life come to a hundred and forty - seven year .      when the time approach for Israel to die , he call his son Joseph and say to he : if it please you , put your hand under my thigh as a sign of your endure fidelity to I ; do not bury I in Egypt .      when I lie down with my ancestor , take I out of Egypt and bury I in their burial place .    I will do as you say , he reply .      but his father demand , swear it to I ! so Joseph swear to he . then Israel bow at the head of the bed .              '
