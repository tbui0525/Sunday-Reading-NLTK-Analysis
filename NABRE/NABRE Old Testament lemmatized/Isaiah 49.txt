b '   chapter 49 the Servant of the Lord    hear I , coastland ,   listen , distant people .   before birth the   Lord   call I ,   from my mother womb he give I my name .    he make my mouth like a sharp - edge sword ,   conceal I , shield by his hand . he make I a sharpen arrow ,   in his quiver he hide I .   he say to I , you be my servant ,   in you , Israel ,    I show my glory .     though I think I have toil in vain ,   for nothing and for naught spend my strength , yet my right be with the   Lord ,   my recompense be with my God .    for now the   Lord   have speak   who form I as his servant from the womb , that Jacob may be bring back to he   and Israel gather to he ; I be honor in the sight of the   Lord ,   and my God be now my strength !   it be too little , he say , for you to be my servant ,   to raise up the tribe of Jacob ,   and restore the survivor of Israel ;   I will make you a light to the nation ,   that my salvation may reach to the end of the earth .    thus say the   Lord ,   the redeemer , the Holy One of Israel , to the one despise , abhor by the nation ,   the slave of ruler : when king see you , they shall stand up ,   and prince shall bow down because of the   Lord   who be faithful ,   the Holy One of Israel who have choose you .     the Liberation and Restoration of Zion    thus say the   Lord : in a time of favor I answer you ,    on the day of salvation I help you ; I form you and set you   as a covenant for the people , to restore the land   and allot the devastated heritage ,    to say to the prisoner : come out !   to those in darkness : show yourself ! along the roadway they shall find pasture ,   on every barren height shall their pasture be .    they shall not hunger or thirst ;   nor shall scorch wind or sun strike they ; for he who pity they lead they   and guide they beside spring of water .    I will turn all my mountain into roadway ,   and make my highway level .    see , these shall come from afar :   some from the north and the west ,   other from the land of Syene .      sing out , heaven , and rejoice , earth ,   break forth into song , you mountain , for the   Lord   comfort his people   and show mercy to his afflict .     but Zion say , the   Lord   have forsake I ;   my Lord have forget I .    can a mother forget her infant ,   be without tenderness for the child of her womb ? even should she forget ,   I will never forget you .    see , upon the palm of my hand I have engrave you ;    your wall be ever before I .   your child hasten\xe2\x80\x94   your leveler , your destroyer   go forth from you ;   look about and see ,   they be all gather and come to you . as I live\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord \xe2\x80\x94   you shall don they as jewel ,   bedeck yourself like a bride .     though you be waste and desolate ,   a land of ruin , now you shall be too narrow for your inhabitant ,   while those who swallow you up will be far away .   the child of whom you be bereft   shall yet say in your hearing , this place be too narrow for I ,   make room for I to live in .   you shall ask yourself :   who have bear I these ,   when I be bereft and barren ? exile and repudiate ,   who have rear they ? I be leave all alone ;   where then do these come from ?     thus say the Lord   God : see , I will lift up my hand to the nation ,   and to the people raise my signal ; they shall bring your son in their arm ,   your daughter shall be carry on their shoulder .    king shall be your guardian ,   their princess your nursemaid ; face to the ground , they shall bow down before you   and lick the dust at your foot . then you shall know that I be the   Lord ,   none who hope in I shall be ashamed .   can plunder be take from a warrior ,   or captive rescue from a tyrant ?    thus say the   Lord : yes , captive can be take from a warrior ,   and plunder rescue from a tyrant ; those who oppose you I will oppose ,   and your son I will save .   I will make your oppressor eat their own flesh ,   and they shall be drunk with their own blood   as though with new wine . all flesh shall know   that I , the   Lord , be your savior ,   your redeemer , the Mighty One of Jacob .
