b ' prayer in Time of Distress   the prayer of one afflict and waste away whose anguish be pour out before the   Lord .    I   Lord , hear my prayer ;   let my cry come to you .   do not hide your face from I   in the day of my distress .   turn your ear to I ;   when I call , answer I quickly .   for my day vanish like smoke ;    my bone burn away as in a furnace .   my heart be wither , dry up like grass ,   too waste to eat my food .   from my loud groan   I become just skin and bone .   I be like a desert owl ,   like an owl among the ruin .   I lie awake and moan ,   like a lone sparrow on the roof .   all day long my enemy taunt I ;   in their rage , they make my name a curse .    I eat ashe like bread ,   mingle my drink with tear .    because of your furious wrath ,   you lift I up just to cast I down .    my day be like a lengthen shadow ;    I wither like the grass .    II   but you ,   Lord , be enthrone forever ;   your renown be for all generation .    you will again show mercy to Zion ;   now be the time for pity ;   the appoint time have come .   its stone be dear to your servant ;   its dust move they to pity .   the nation shall fear your name ,   Lord ,   all the king of the earth , your glory ,    once the   Lord   have rebuild Zion   and appear in glory ,   heed the plea of the lowly ,   not scorn their prayer .   let this be write for the next generation ,   for a people not yet bear ,   that they may praise the   Lord :     the   Lord   look down from the holy height ,   view the earth from heaven ,    to attend to the groaning of the prisoner ,   to release those doom to die .    then the   Lord s name will be declare on Zion ,   his praise in Jerusalem ,   when people and kingdom gather   to serve the   Lord .     III   he have shatter my strength in mid - course ,   have cut short my day .   I plead , o my God ,   do not take I in the midst of my day .     your year last through all generation .   of old you lay the earth foundation ;    the heavens be the work of your hand .   they perish , but you remain ;   they all wear out like a garment ; like clothing you change they and they be change ,    but you be the same , your year have no end .   may the child of your servant live on ;   may their descendant live in your presence .
