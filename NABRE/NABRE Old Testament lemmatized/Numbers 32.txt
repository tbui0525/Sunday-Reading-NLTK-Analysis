b '   request of Gad and Reuben .     now the Reubenites and Gadites have a very large number of livestock . notice that the land of Jazer and of Gilead    be a place suit to livestock ,      the Gadites and Reubenites come to Moses and Eleazar the priest and to the leader of the community and say ,       the region of Ataroth , Dibon , Jazer , Nimrah , Heshbon , Elealeh , Sebam , Nebo and Baal - meon\xe2\x80\x94      the land which the   Lord   have lay low before the community of Israel , be a land for livestock , and your servant have livestock .      they continue , if we find favor with you , let this land be give to your servant as their possession . do not make we cross the Jordan .    Moses Rebuke .     but Moses answer the Gadites and Reubenites : be your kindred , then , to go to war , while you remain here ?      why do you wish to discourage the Israelites from cross to the land the   Lord   have give they ?      that be just what your ancestor do when I send they from Kadesh - barnea to reconnoiter the land .        they go up to the Wadi Eshcol and reconnoiter the land , then so discourage the Israelites that they would not enter the land the   Lord   have give they .       at that time the anger of the   Lord   flare up , and he swear :      none of the man twenty year old or more who have come up from Egypt will see the land I promise under oath to Abraham and Isaac and Jacob , because they have not follow I unreservedly\xe2\x80\x94       except the Kenizzite    Caleb , son of Jephunneh , the Kenizzite , and Joshua , son of Nun , since they have follow the   Lord   unreservedly .      so the anger of the   Lord   flare up against the Israelites and he make they wander in the wilderness forty year , until the whole generation that have do evil in the sight of the   Lord   have disappear .      and now here you be , offspring of sinful stock , rise up in your ancestor place to add still more to the   Lord s blaze anger against the Israelites .      if you turn away from follow he , he will again abandon they in the wilderness , and you will bring about the ruin of this entire people .    Counter Proposal .     but they approach he and say : we will only build sheepfold here for our flock and town for our family ;      but we ourselves will march as troop in the vanguard before the Israelites ,    until we have lead they to their destination . meanwhile our family will remain in the fortify town because of the land inhabitant .      we will not return to our home until all the Israelites have take possession of their heritage .       but we will not claim any heritage with they across the Jordan and beyond , because we have receive a heritage for ourselves on the eastern side of the Jordan .    Agreement reach .      Moses say to they in reply : if you do this\xe2\x80\x94if you march as troop before the   Lord   into battle      and cross the Jordan in full force before the   Lord   until he have drive his enemy out of his way      and the land be subdue before the   Lord , then you may return here , free from every obligation to the   Lord   and to Israel , and this land will be your possession before the   Lord .        but if you do not do this , you will have sin against the   Lord , and you can be sure that the consequence of your sin will overtake you .      build the town , then , for your family , and the fold for your flock , but fulfill what you have promise .     the Gadites and Reubenites answer Moses , your servant will do as my lord command .       while our wife and child , our livestock and other animal remain there in the town of Gilead ,      all your servant will go across as armed troop before the   Lord   to battle , just as my lord say .     so Moses give this command in their regard to Eleazar the priest , to Joshua , son of Nun , and to the head of the ancestral house of the israelite tribe :      he say to they , if all the Gadites and Reubenites cross the Jordan with you in full force before the   Lord   into battle , the land will be subdue before you , and you will give they Gilead as a possession .      but if they will not go across in force with you before the   Lord , you will bring their wife and child and livestock across before you into Canaan , and they will possess a holding among you in the land of Canaan .     to this the Gadites and Reubenites reply , we will do what the   Lord   have order your servant .      we ourselves will go across in force before the   Lord   into the land of Canaan , but we will retain our hereditary property on this side of the Jordan .        so Moses give them\xe2\x80\x94   the Gadites and Reubenites , as well as half the tribe of Manasseh , son of joseph\xe2\x80\x94the kingdom of Sihon , king of the Amorites , and the kingdom of Og , king of Bashan , the land with its town , and the district of the surround town .      the Gadites rebuild the city of Dibon , Ataroth , Aroer ,      Atroth - shophan , Jazer , Jogbehah ,      Beth - nimrah and Beth - haran\xe2\x80\x94fortified cities\xe2\x80\x94and sheepfold .      the Reubenites rebuild Heshbon , Elealeh , Kiriathaim ,      Nebo , Baal - meon ( name to be change ! ) ,    and Sibmah . these town , which they rebuild , they call by their old name .    other Conquests .     the descendant of Machir , son of Manasseh , go to Gilead and capture it , dispossess the Amorites who be there .      ( Moses give Gilead to Machir ,    son of Manasseh , and he settle there . )      Jair ,    a descendant of Manasseh , go and capture their tent village , and call they Havvoth - jair .        Nobah go and capture Kenath with its dependency and call it Nobah after his own name .             '
