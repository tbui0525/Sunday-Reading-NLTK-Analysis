b '   promise and warning to Solomon .     after Solomon finish build the house of the   Lord , the house of the king , and everything else that he want to do ,       the   Lord   appear to Solomon a second time , as he have appear to he in Gibeon .      the   Lord   say to he : I have hear the prayer of petition which you offer in my presence . I have consecrate this house which you have build and I set my name there forever ; my eye and my heart shall be there always .      as for you , if you walk before I as David your father do , wholeheartedly and uprightly , do all that I have command you , keep my statute and ordinance ,       I will establish your royal throne over Israel forever , as I promise David your father : there shall never be want someone from your line on the throne of Israel .      but if ever you and your descendant turn from follow I , fail to keep my commandment and statute which I set before you , and proceed to serve other god and bow down to they ,      I will cut off Israel from the land I give they and repudiate the house I have consecrate for my name . Israel shall become a proverb and a byword among all nation ,       and this house shall become a heap of ruin . every passerby shall gasp in horror and ask , why have the   Lord   do such thing to this land and to this house ?      and the answer will come : because they abandon the   Lord , their God , who bring their ancestor out of the land of Egypt , and they embrace other god , bow down to they and serve they . that be why the   Lord   have bring upon they all this evil . after build the Temple .         after the twenty year during which Solomon build the two house , the house of the   Lord   and the house of the king\xe2\x80\x94      Hiram , king of Tyre , supply Solomon with all the cedar wood , fir wood , and gold he wish , and King Solomon give Hiram in return twenty city in the land of Galilee\xe2\x80\x94      Hiram leave Tyre to see the city Solomon have give he , but he be not satisfied with they .      so he say , what be these city you have give I , my brother ?    and he call they the land of Cabul , as they be call to this day .      Hiram , however , have send King Solomon one hundred and twenty talent of gold .      this be an account of the conscript labor force King Solomon raise in order to build the house of the   Lord , his own house , Millo ,    the wall of Jerusalem , Hazor , Megiddo , Gezer      ( Pharaoh , king of Egypt , have come up and take Gezer and , after destroy it by fire and slay all the Canaanites live in the city , have give it as a farewell gift to his daughter , solomons wife ;      Solomon then rebuild Gezer ) , Lower Beth - horon ,      Baalath , Tamar in the desert of Judah ,      all his city for supply , city for chariot and city for cavalry , and whatever Solomon desire to build in Jerusalem , in Lebanon , and in the entire land under his dominion .      all the people who be leave of the Amorites , Hittites , Perizzites , Hivites , and Jebusites , who be not Israelites\xe2\x80\x94      those of their descendant who be leave in the land and whom the Israelites have not be able to destroy under the ban\xe2\x80\x94these Solomon conscript as force laborer , as they be to this day .      but Solomon make none of the Israelites force laborer , for they be his fighting force , his minister , commander , adjutant , chariot officer , and cavalry .      there be five hundred fifty overseer answerable to solomons governor for the work , direct the people engage in the work .      as soon as Pharaohs daughter go up from the City of David to her house , which he have build for she , Solomon build Millo .      three time a year Solomon use to offer burn offering and communion offering on the altar which he have build to the   Lord , and to burn incense before the   Lord . thus he complete the temple .   Solomons Gifts .
