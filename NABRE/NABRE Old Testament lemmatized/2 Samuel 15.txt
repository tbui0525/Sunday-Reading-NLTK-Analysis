Absalom also send to Ahithophel the Gilonite , Davids counselor , an invitation to come from his town , Giloh , for the sacrifice he be about to offer . so the conspiracy gain strength , and the people with Absalom increase in number .     David Flees Jerusalem .     an informant come to David with the report , the Israelites have give their heart to Absalom ,    and they be follow he .      at this , David say to all his servant who be with he in Jerusalem : get up , let we flee , or none of we will escape from Absalom . leave at once , or he will quickly overtake we , and then bring disaster upon we , and put the city to the sword .      the king servant answer he , whatever our lord the king choose to do , we be your servant .      then the king set out , accompany by his entire household , except for ten concubine whom he leave behind to care for the palace .        as the king leave the city , with all his officer accompany he , they halt opposite the ascent of the Mount of Olives , at a distance ,      while the whole army march past he . David and Ittai .   as all the Cherethites and Pelethites , and the six hundred gittite who have enter his service from that city , be pass in review before the king ,        the king say to Ittai the Gittite : why should you also go with we ? go back and stay with the king , for you be a foreigner and you , too , be an exile from your own country .      you come only yesterday , and today shall I have you wander off with we wherever I have to go ? return and take your brother with you , and may the   Lord   show you kindness and fidelity .      but Ittai answer the king , as the   Lord   live , and as my lord the king live , your servant shall be wherever my lord the king be , whether for death or for life .        so the king say to Ittai , go , then , march on . and Ittai the Gittite , with all his man and all the dependent that be with he , march on .      the whole land weep aloud as the last of the soldier go by , and the king cross the Wadi Kidron with all the soldier move on ahead of he by way of the ascent of the Mount of Olives , toward the wilderness .    David and the priest .     Zadok , too , and all the Levites bear the ark of the covenant of God set down the ark of God until the whole army have finish march out of the city ; and Abiathar come up .      then the king say to Zadok : take the ark of God back to the city . if I find favor with the   Lord , he will bring I back and permit I to see it and its lodging place .      but if he should say , I be not pleased with you , I be ready ; let he do to I as he see fit .        the king also say to Zadok the priest : look , you and Abiathar return to the city in peace , and both your son with you , your own son Ahimaaz , and Abiathars son Jonathan .      remember , I shall be wait at the ford near the wilderness until a report from you come to I .      so Zadok and Abiathar take the ark of God back to Jerusalem and remain there .     as David go up the ascent of the Mount of Olives , he weep without cease . his head be cover , and he be walk barefoot . all those who be with he also have their head cover and be weep as they go .        when David be tell , Ahithophel be among the conspirator with Absalom , he say , o   Lord , turn the counsel of Ahithophel to folly !     David and Hushai .     when David reach the top , where God be worship , Hushai the Archite be there to meet he , with garment tear and dirt upon his head .        David say to he : if you come with I , you will be a burden to I ;      but if you return to the city and say to Absalom , let I be your servant , o king ; I be formerly your father servant , but now I will be yours , you will thwart for I the counsel of Ahithophel .        you will have the priest Zadok and Abiathar there with you . if you hear anything from the king house , you shall report it to the priest Zadok and Abiathar ,      who have there with they their two son , Zadoks son Ahimaaz and Abiathars son Jonathan . through they you shall send on to I whatever you hear .      so Davids friend Hushai go into the city , Jerusalem , as Absalom be about to enter it .
