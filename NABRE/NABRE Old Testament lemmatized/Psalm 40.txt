b ' Gratitude and Prayer for help   for the leader . a psalm of David .    a   surely , I wait for the   Lord ;   who bend down to I and hear my cry ,    draw I up from the pit of destruction ,   out of the muddy clay ,   set my foot upon rock ,   steady my step ,   and put a new song    in my mouth ,    a hymn to our God . many shall look on in fear   and they shall trust in the   Lord .   bless the man who set   his security in the   Lord ,   who turn not to the arrogant   or to those who stray after falsehood .    you , yes you , o   Lord , my God ,   have do many wondrous deed ! and in your plan for we   there be none to equal you .   should I wish to declare or tell they ,   too many be they to recount .     Sacrifice and offer you do not want ;    you open my ear . Holocaust and sin - offering you do not request ;    so I say , See ; I come   with an inscribed scroll write upon I .   I delight to do your will , my God ;   your law be in my inner being !    when I sing of your righteousness   in a great assembly , see , I do not restrain my lip ;   as you ,   Lord , know .    I do not conceal your righteousness   within my heart ; I speak of your loyalty and your salvation .   I do not hide your mercy or faithfulness from a great assembly .   Lord , may you not withhold   your compassion from I ; may your mercy and your faithfulness   continually protect I .     b   but evil surround I   until they can not be count . my sin overtake I ,   so that I can no long see . they be more numerous than the hair of my head ;   my courage fail I .    Lord , graciously rescue I !    come quickly to help I ,   Lord !   may those who seek to destroy my life   be shame and confound . turn back in disgrace   those who desire my ruin .    let those who say to I Aha !    be make desolate on account of their shame .   while those who seek you   rejoice and be glad in you . may those who long for your salvation   always say , the   Lord   be great .    though I be afflict and poor ,   my Lord keep I in mind . you be my help and deliverer ;   my God , do not delay !
