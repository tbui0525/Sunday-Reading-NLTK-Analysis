b '    Canaanites in Palestine .      after the death of Joshua the Israelites consult the   Lord , ask , who shall be first among we to attack the Canaanites and to do battle with they ?      the   Lord   answer : Judah shall attack : I have deliver the land into his power .        Judah then say to his brother Simeon , come up with I into the territory allot to I , and let we do battle with the Canaanites . I will likewise go with you into the territory allot to you . so Simeon go with he .      when Judah attack , the   Lord   deliver the Canaanites and Perizzites into their power , and they strike down ten thousand of they in Bezek .       they come upon Adonibezek in Bezek and fight against he . when they strike down the Canaanites and Perizzites ,      Adonibezek flee . they pursue he , and when they catch he , they cut off his thumb and big toe .      seventy king , say Adonibezek , use to pick up scrap under my table with their thumb and big toe cut off . as I have do , so have God repay I . he be bring to Jerusalem , and he die there .       the Judahites fight against Jerusalem , capture it , and put it to the sword , set the city itself on fire .      afterward the Judahites go down to fight against the Canaanites who live in the mountain region , in the Negeb , and in the foothill .        Judah also march against the Canaanites who live in Hebron , which be formerly call Kiriath - arba , and defeat Sheshai , Ahiman , and Talmai .        they march from there against the inhabitant of Debir , which be formerly call Kiriath - sepher .      Caleb say , to the man who attack Kiriath - sepher and capture it , I will give my daughter Achsah in marriage .       Othniel capture it , the son of Calebs young brother Kenaz ; so Caleb give he his daughter Achsah in marriage .      when she come to he , she induce he to ask her father for some land . then , as she alight from the donkey , Caleb ask she , what do you want ?      she answer , give I a present . since you have put I in the land of the Negeb , give I pool of water . so Caleb give she what she want , both the upper and the low pool .      the descendant of Hobab the Kenite , Moses father - in - law ,    come up with the Judahites from the City of Palms to the wilderness of Arad , which be in the Negeb , and they settle among the Amalekites .       then Judah go with his brother Simeon , and they defeat the Canaanites who live in Zephath . they put the city under the ban and rename it Hormah .         Judah capture Gaza with its territory , Ashkelon with its territory , Ekron with its territory , and Ashdod    with its territory .        the   Lord   be with Judah , so they gain possession of the mountain region . but they could not dispossess those who live on the plain , because they have iron chariot .       as Moses have command , they give Hebron to Caleb , who then drive the three son of Anak away from there .      as for the Jebusites dwell in Jerusalem , the Benjaminites do not dispossess they , so that the Jebusites live with the Benjaminites in Jerusalem to the present day .      the house of Joseph , too , go up against Bethel , and the   Lord   be with they .      the house of Joseph reconnoiter Bethel , which formerly be call Luz .        the scout see a man come out of the city and say to he , tell we the way into the city , and we will show you mercy .      he show they the way into the city , and they put the city to the sword ; but they let the man and his whole clan go free .      the man then go to the land of the Hittites , where he build a city and call it Luz , which be its name to this day .      Manasseh do not take possession of Beth - shean with its town or of Taanach with its town . nor do they dispossess the inhabitant of Dor and its town , those of Ibleam and its town , or those of Megiddo and its town . the Canaanites continue to live in this district .      when Israel grow strong , they conscript the Canaanites as laborer , but do not actually drive they out .       Ephraim do not drive out the Canaanites live in Gezer , and so the Canaanites live among they in Gezer .      nor do Zebulun dispossess the inhabitant of Kitron or those of Nahalol ; the Canaanites live among they and become force laborer .      nor do Asher dispossess the inhabitant of Acco or those of Sidon , or take possession of Mahaleb , Achzib , Helbah , Aphik , or Rehob .      so the Asherites settle among the canaanite inhabitant of the land , for they have not dispossess they .      nor do Naphtali drive out the inhabitant of Beth - shemesh or those of Beth - anath . they settle among the canaanite inhabitant of the land and the inhabitant of Beth - shemesh and Beth - anath become force laborer for they .     the Amorites hem in the Danites in the mountain region , not permit they to come down onto the plain .      so the Amorites continue to live in Harheres , Aijalon , and Shaalbim , but as the power of the house of Joseph grow , they be conscript as laborer .     the territory of the Amorites extend from the Akrabbim pass , from Sela and upward .
