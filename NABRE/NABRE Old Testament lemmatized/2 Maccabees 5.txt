b '   Jasons Revolt .     about this time Antiochus send his second expedition    into Egypt .         it then happen that all over the city , for nearly forty day , there appear horseman , clothe in garment of a golden weave , charge in midair\xe2\x80\x94companie fully arm with lance and draw sword ;      squadron of cavalry in battle array , charge and countercharge on this side and that , with brandished shield and bristle spear , flight of arrow and flash of gold ornament , together with armor of every sort .      therefore all pray that this vision might be a good omen .     but when a false rumor circulate that Antiochus be dead , Jason    gather at least a thousand man and suddenly attack the city . as the defender on the wall be force back and the city be finally be take , Menelaus take refuge in the citadel .      for his part , Jason continue the merciless slaughter of his fellow citizen , not realize that triumph over one own kindred be the great calamity ; he think he be win a victory over his enemy , not over his own people .      even so , he do not gain control of the government , but in the end receive only disgrace for his treachery , and once again take refuge in the country of the Ammonites .      at length he meet a miserable end . call to account before Aretas ,    ruler of the Arabians , he flee from city to city , hunt by all , hate as an apostate from the law , abhor as the executioner of his country and his compatriot . drive into Egypt ,      he set out by sea for the Lacedaemonians , among whom he hope to find protection because of his relation with they . he who have exile so many from their country perish in exile ;      and he who have cast out so many to lie unburie go unmourned and without a funeral of any kind , nor any place in the tomb of his ancestor .    Revenge by Antiochus .      when these happening be report to the king , he think that Judea be in revolt . rage like a wild animal , he set out from Egypt and take Jerusalem by storm .      he order his soldier to cut down without mercy those whom they meet and to slay those who take refuge in their house .      there be a massacre of young and old , a killing of woman and child , a slaughter of young woman and infant .      in the space of three day , eighty thousand be lose , forty thousand meet a violent death , and the same number be sell into slavery .     not satisfied with this , the king dare to enter the holy temple in the world ; Menelaus , that traitor both to the law and to his country , serve as guide .      he lay his impure hand on the sacred vessel and sweep up with profane hand the votive offering make by other king for the advancement , the glory , and the honor of the place .      Antiochus become puff up in spirit , not realize that it be because of the sin of the citys inhabitant that the Sovereign Lord be angry for a little while : hence the disregard of the place .        if they have not become entangled in so many sin , this man , like that Heliodorus send by King Seleucus to inspect the treasury , would have be flog and turn back from his presumptuous act as soon as he approach .      the Lord , however , have not choose the nation for the sake of the place , but the place for the sake of the nation .      therefore , the place itself , having share in the nation misfortune , afterward participate in their good fortune ; and what the Almighty have forsake in wrath be restore in all its glory , once the great Sovereign Lord become reconcile .      Antiochus carry off eighteen hundred talent from the temple and hurry back to Antioch , think in his arrogance that he could make the land navigable and the sea passable on foot , so carry away be he with pride .      he leave governor to harass the nation : at Jerusalem , Philip , a Phrygian by birth ,    and in character more barbarous than the man who appoint he ;        at Mount Gerizim ,    Andronicus ; and besides these , Menelaus , who lord it over his fellow citizen more than the other . out of hatred for the jewish citizen ,       the king send Apollonius ,    commander of the Mysians , at the head of an army of twenty - two thousand , with order to kill all the grow man and sell the woman and child into slavery .      when this man arrive in Jerusalem , he pretend to be peacefully dispose and wait until the holy day of the sabbath ; then , find the Jews refrain from work , he order his man to parade fully armed .      all those who come out to watch , he massacre , and run through the city with armed man , he cut down a large number of people .     but Judas Maccabeus and about nine other withdraw to the wilderness to avoid share in defilement ; there he and his companion live like the animal in the hill , eat what grow wild .
