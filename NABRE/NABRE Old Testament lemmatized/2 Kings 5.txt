Naaman say : if you will not accept , please let I , your servant , have two mule - load of earth ,    for your servant will no long make burn offering or sacrifice to any other god except the   Lord .      but may the   Lord   forgive your servant this : when my master enter the temple of Rimmon to bow down there , as he lean upon my arm , I too must bow down in the temple of Rimmon . when I bow down in the temple of Rimmon , may the   Lord   please forgive your servant this .      Elisha say to he , go in peace .   Naaman have go some distance      when Gehazi , the servant of Elisha , the man of God , think to himself : my master be too easy on this Aramean Naaman , not accept what he bring . as the   Lord   live , I will run after he and get something out of he .      so Gehazi hurry after Naaman . see that someone be run after he , Naaman alight from his chariot to wait for he . he ask , be everything all right ?      Gehazi reply , yes , but my master send I to say , two young man have just come to I , guild prophet from the hill country of Ephraim . please give they a talent of silver and two festal garment .      Naaman say , I insist ! take two talent , and he press he . he tie up two silver talent in bag and give they , with two festal garment , to two of his servant , who carry they before Gehazi .      when he reach the hill , Gehazi receive these thing , appropriate they for his house , and send the man on their way .     he go in and stand by Elisha his master , who ask he , where have you be , Gehazi ? he answer , your servant have not go anywhere .      but Elisha say to he : be I not present in spirit when someone get down from his chariot to wait for you ? be this a time to take money or to take garment , olive orchard or vineyard , sheep or cattle , male or female servant ?      the leprosy of Naaman shall cling to you and your descendant forever . and Gehazi go out , a leper with skin like snow .
