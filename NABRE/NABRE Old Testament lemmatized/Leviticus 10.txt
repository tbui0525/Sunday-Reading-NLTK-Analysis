b '   Nadab and Abihu .      Aarons son Nadab and Abihu take their censer and , put incense on the fire they have set in they ,    they offer before the   Lord   unauthorized fire , such as he have not command .      Fire therefore come forth from the   Lord s presence and consume they ,    so that they die in the   Lord s presence .      Moses then say to Aaron , this be as the   Lord   say : through those near to I I will be sanctify ;   in the sight of all the people I will obtain glory .    but Aaron say nothing .       then Moses summon Mishael and Elzaphan , the son of Aarons uncle Uzziel , with the order , come , carry your kinsman from before the sanctuary to a place outside the camp .      so they draw near and carry they by mean of their tunic outside the camp , as Moses have command .    Conduct of the Priests .     Moses say to Aaron and his son Eleazar and Ithamar , do not dishevel your hair    or tear your garment ,    lest you die and bring Gods wrath also on the whole community . while your kindred , the rest of the house of Israel , may mourn for those whom the   Lord s fire have burn up ,      you shall not go beyond the entrance of the tent of meeting ,    else you shall die ; for the anoint oil of the   Lord   be upon you . so they do as Moses tell they .     the   Lord   say to Aaron :      when you be to go to the tent of meeting , you and your son be forbid , by a perpetual statute throughout your generation , to drink any wine or strong drink , lest you die .        you must be able to distinguish between what be sacred and what be profane , and between what be clean and what be unclean ;         and you must be able to teach the Israelites all the statute that the   Lord   have give they through Moses .    the eating of the Priestly Portions .     Moses say to Aaron and his survive son , Eleazar and Ithamar , take the grain offering    leave over from the oblation to the   Lord , and eat it beside the altar in the form of unleavened cake , since it be most holy .      you must eat it in a sacred place because it be your and your son due from the oblation to the   Lord ; such be the command I have receive .       the brisket of the elevated offering and the leg    of the contribution , however , you and your son and daughter may eat , in a clean place ; for these have be assign to you and your child as your due from the communion sacrifice of the Israelites .      the leg of the contribution and the brisket of the elevated offering shall be bring in with the oblation of fat to be raise as an elevated offering before the   Lord . they shall belong to you and your child as your due forever , as the   Lord   have command .     Moses inquire closely about the goat of the purification offering    and discover that it have all be burn . so he be angry with the survive son of Aaron , Eleazar and Ithamar , and say ,       why do you not eat the purification offering in the sacred place , since it be most holy ? it have be give to you that you might remove the guilt of the community and make atonement for they before the   Lord .      since its blood be not bring inside the sanctuary , you should certainly have eat the offering in the sanctuary , as I be command .      Aaron answer Moses , even though they present their purification offering and burn offering before the   Lord   today , still this misfortune have befall I . have I then eat of the purification offering today , would it have be pleasing to the   Lord ?      on hear this , Moses be satisfied .
