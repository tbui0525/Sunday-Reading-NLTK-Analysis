b '     be not hasty in your utterance and let not your heart be quick to utter a promise in Gods presence . God be in heaven and you be on earth ; therefore let your word be few .      as dream come along with many care ,   so a fool voice along with a multitude of word .      when you make a vow to God , delay not its fulfillment . for God have no pleasure in fool ; fulfill what you have vow .      it be well not to make a vow than make it and not fulfill it .      let not your utterance make you guilty , and say not before his representative , it be a mistake . why should God be anger by your word and destroy the work of your hand ?       despite many dream , futility , and a multitude of word , fear God !    gain and Loss of Goods .      if you see oppression of the poor , and violation of right and justice in the realm , do not be astonish by the fact , for the high official have another high than he watch he and above these be other high still\xe2\x80\x94 .      but profitable for a land in such circumstance be a king concerned about cultivation .       the covetous be never satisfied with money , nor lover of wealth with their gain ; so this too be vanity .      where there be great rich , there be also many to devour they . of what use be they to the owner except as a feast for the eye alone ?      sleep be sweet to the laborer , whether there be little or much to eat ; but the abundance of the rich allow they no sleep .     this be a grievous evil which I have see under the sun : rich hoard by their owner to their own hurt .      should the rich be lose through some misfortune , they may have offspring when they have no means .       as they come forth from their mother womb , so again shall they return , naked as they come , have nothing from their toil to bring with they .      this too be a grievous evil , that they go just as they come . what then do it profit they to toil for the wind ?      all their day they eat in gloom with great vexation , sickness and resentment .      here be what I see as good : it be appropriate to eat and drink and prosper from all the toil one toil at under the sun during the limited day of life God give we ; for this be our lot .      those to whom God give rich and property , and grant power to partake of they , so that they receive their lot and find joy in the fruit of their toil : this be a gift from God .      for they will hardly dwell on the shortness of life , because God let they busy themselves with the joy of their heart .
