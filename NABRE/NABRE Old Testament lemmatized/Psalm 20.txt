b ' prayer for the King in Time of War   for the leader . a psalm of David .    I   the   Lord   answer you in time of distress ;   the name of the God of Jacob defend you !   may he send you help from the sanctuary ,   from Zion be your support .    may he remember    your every offering ,   graciously accept your burn offering , Selah   Grant what be in your heart ,   fulfill your every plan .   may we shout for joy at your victory ,    raise the banner in the name of our God .   the   Lord   grant your every petition !    II   now I know the   Lord   give victory   to his anoint .   he will answer he from the holy heavens   with a strong arm that bring victory .   some rely on chariot , other on horse ,   but we on the name of the   Lord   our God .    they collapse and fall ,   but we stand strong and firm .    Lord , grant victory to the king ;   answer when we call upon you .             '
