b ' VI . Jobs final Summary of his Cause     Job take up his theme again and say :     oh , that I be as in the month past ,   as in the day when God watch over I :    while he keep his lamp shine above my head ,   and by his light I walk through darkness ;   as I be in my flourish day ,   when God shelter my tent ;   when the Almighty be still with I ,   and my child be round about I ;   when my footstep be bathe in cream ,   and the rock flow with stream of oil .    whenever I go out to the gate of the city   and take my seat in the square ,   the young man see I and withdraw ,   and the elder rise up and stand ;   official refrain from speak   and cover their mouth with their hand ;    the voice of the prince be silence ,   and their tongue stick to the roof of their mouth .   the ear that hear bless I ;   the eye that see acclaim I .   for I rescue the poor who cry out for help ,   the orphan , and the unassisted ;   the blessing of those in extremity come upon I ,   and the heart of the widow I make joyful .

I decide their course and sit at their head ,   I live like a king among the troop ,   like one who comfort mourner .             '
