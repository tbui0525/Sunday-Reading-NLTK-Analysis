b '   the end have Come .     the word of the   Lord   come to I :      Son of man , now say : thus say the Lord   God   to the land of Israel : an end ! the end come upon the four corner of the land !        now the end be upon you ; I will unleash my anger against you , judge you accord to your way , and hold against you all your abomination .      my eye will not spare you , nor will I have pity ; but I will hold your conduct against you , since your abomination remain within you ; then shall you know that I be the   Lord .      thus say the Lord   God : evil upon evil ! see it come !      an end be come , the end be come ; it be ripe for you ! see it come !      the crisis have come for you who dwell in the land ! the time have come , near be the day : panic , no rejoicing on the mountain .        soon now I will pour out my fury upon you and spend my anger against you ; I will judge you accord to your way and hold against you all your abomination .        my eye will not spare , nor will I take pity ; I will hold your conduct against you since your abomination remain within you , then you shall know that it be I , the   Lord , who strike .      the day be here ! look ! it be come ! the crisis have come ! lawlessness be bloom , insolence budding ;      the violent have rise up to wield a scepter of wickedness . but none of they shall remain ; none of their crowd , none of their wealth , for none of they be innocent .       the time have come , the day dawn . the buyer must not rejoice , nor the seller mourn , for wrath be come upon all the throng .        assuredly , the seller shall not regain what be sell , as long as they all live ; for the vision be for the whole crowd : it shall not be revoke ! yes , because of their guilt , they shall not hold on to life .      they will sound the trumpet and get everything ready , but no one will go out to battle , for my wrath weigh upon all the crowd .     the sword be outside ; disease and hunger be within . whoever be in the field will die by the sword ; whoever be in the city disease and hunger will devour .        if their survivor flee , they will die on the mountain , moan like dove of the valley on account of their guilt .      all their hand will hang limp , and all their knee    turn to water .         they put on sackcloth , horror clothe they ; shame be on all their face , all their head be shave bald .        they fle their silver into the street , and their gold be consider unclean .    their silver and gold can not save they on the day of the   Lord s wrath . they can not satisfy their hunger or fill their belly , for it have be the occasion of their sin .       in their beautiful ornament they take pride ; out of they they make their abominable image , their detestable thing . for this reason I will make they unclean .        I will hand they over as spoil to foreigner , as plunder to the wicked of the earth , so that they may defile they .      I will turn my face away from they . my treasure will be defile ; the violent will enter and defile it .        they will wreak slaughter , for the land be fill with bloodshed and the city with violence .        I will bring in the bad of the nation to take possession of their house . I will put an end to their proud strength ,    and their sanctuary will be defile .        when anguish come , they will seek peace , but there be none .        disaster after disaster , rumor upon rumor . they keep seek a vision from the prophet ; instruction from the priest be miss , and counsel from the elder .        the king mourn , the prince be terror - stricken , the hand of the common people tremble . I will deal with they accord to their way , and accord to their judgment I will judge they . they shall know that I be the   Lord .             '
