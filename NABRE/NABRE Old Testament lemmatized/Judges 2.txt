b '   Infidelities of the Israelites .     a messenger of the   Lord   go up from Gilgal to Bochim and say , I bring you up from Egypt and lead you into the land which I promise on oath to your ancestor . I say , I will never break my covenant with you ,      but you must not make a covenant with the inhabitant of this land ; you must pull down their altar .    but you do not listen to I . look what you have do !      for I also say ,    I will not clear they out of your way ; they will become trap for you , and their god a snare for you .      when the messenger of the   Lord   have speak these thing to all the Israelites , the people weep aloud .      they name that place Bochim ,    and they offer sacrifice there to the   Lord .      then Joshua dismiss the people , and the Israelites go , each to their own heritage , to take possession of the land .      the people serve the   Lord   during the entire lifetime of Joshua , and of those elder who outlive Joshua and who have see all the great work the   Lord   have do for Israel .      Joshua , son of Nun , the servant of the   Lord , die at the age of a hundred and ten ,      and they bury he within the border of his heritage at Timnath - here in the mountain region of Ephraim north of Mount Gaash .       when the rest of that generation be also gather to their ancestor , and a later generation arise that do not know the   Lord   or the work he have do for Israel ,       the Israelites do what be evil in the sight of the   Lord . they serve the Baals ,        and abandon the   Lord , the God of their ancestor , the one who have bring they out of the land of Egypt . they follow other god , the god of the people around they , and bow down to they , and provoke the   Lord .     because they have abandon the   Lord   and serve Baal and the Astartes ,        the anger of the   Lord   flare up against Israel , and he deliver they into the power of plunderer who despoil they . he sell they into the power of the enemy around they , and they be no long able to withstand their enemy .      whenever they march out , the hand of the   Lord   turn against they , as the   Lord   have say , and as the   Lord   have swear to they ;    and they be in great distress .      but the   Lord   raise up judge to save they from the power of their plunderer ;      but they do not listen to their judge either , for they prostitute themselves by follow other god , bow down to they . they be quick to stray from the way their ancestor have take , who obey the commandment of the   Lord ; but these do not .      when the   Lord   raise up judge for they , he would be with the judge and save they from the power of their enemy as long as the judge live . the   Lord   would change his mind when they groan in their affliction under their oppressor .      but when the judge die , they would again do bad than their ancestor , follow other god , serve and bow down to they , relinquish none of their evil practice or stubborn way .       the anger of the   Lord   flare up against Israel , and he say : because this nation have transgress my covenant , which I enjoin on their ancestor , and have not listen to I ,      I for my part will not clear away for they any more of the nation Joshua leave when he die .       they will be make to test Israel , to see whether or not they will keep to the way of the   Lord   and continue in it as their ancestor do .      therefore the   Lord   allow these nation to remain instead of expel they immediately . he have not deliver they into the power of Joshua .
