b '     do not envy the wicked ,   nor desire to be with they ;    for their heart plot violence ,   and their lip speak of foul play .   by wisdom a house be build ,   by understand it be establish ;   and by knowledge its room be fill   with every precious and pleasing possession .   the wise be more powerful than the strong ,   and the learn , than the mighty ,    for by strategy war be wage ,   and victory depend on many counselor .     Wise word be beyond fool reach ,    in the assembly they do not open their mouth ;   as they calculate how to do evil ,   people brand they troublemaker .   the scheme of a fool gain no acceptance ,   the scoffer be an abomination to the community .    do you fail in a day of adversity ,   do your strength fall short ?   do you fail to rescue those who be be drag off to death ,    those totter , those near death ,    because you say , we do not know about it ? surely , the Searcher of heart know   and will repay all accord to their deed .     if you eat honey , my son , because it be good ,   if pure honey be sweet to your taste ,   such , you must know , be wisdom to your soul . if you find it , you will have a future ,   and your hope will not be cut off .     do not lie in wait at the abode of the just ,   do not ravage their dwelling place ;   though the just fall seven time , they rise again ,   but the wicked stumble from only one mishap .    do not rejoice when your enemy fall ,   and when they stumble , do not let your heart exult ,   Lest the   Lord   see it , be displeased with you ,   and withdraw his wrath from your enemy .   do not be provoke at evildoer ,   do not envy the wicked ;   for the evil have no future ,   the lamp of the wicked will be put out .    my son , fear the   Lord   and the king ;   have nothing to do with those who hate they ;   for disaster will issue suddenly ,   and calamity from they both , who know when ?     these also be word of the Wise : to show partiality in judgment be not good .    whoever say to the guilty party , you be innocent ,   will be curse by nation , scorn by people ;   but those who render just verdict will fare well ,   and on they will come the blessing of prosperity .   an honest reply\xe2\x80\x94   a kiss on the lip .    complete your outdoor task ,   and arrange your work in the field ;   afterward you can build your house .    do not testify falsely against your neighbor    and so deceive with your lip .   do not say , as they do to I , so will I do to they ;    I will repay they accord to their deed .     I pass by the field of a sluggard ,   by the vineyard of one with no sense ;   it be all overgrown with thistle ;   its surface be cover with nettle ,   and its stone wall break down .   as I gaze at it , I reflect ;   I see and learn a lesson :   a little sleep , a little slumber ,    a little folding of the arm to rest\xe2\x80\x94   then poverty will come upon you like a robber ,   and want like a brigand .
