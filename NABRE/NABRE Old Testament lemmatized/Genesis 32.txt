b '     early the next morning , Laban kiss his grandchild and his daughter and bless they ; then he set out on his journey back home .      meanwhile Jacob continue on his own way , and Gods angel encounter he .      when Jacob see they he say , this be Gods encampment . so he name that place Mahanaim .     envoy to Esau .     Jacob send messenger ahead to his brother Esau in the land of Seir , the country of Edom ,        order they : thus you shall say to my lord Esau : thus say your servant Jacob : I have be reside with Laban and have be delay until now .      I own oxen , donkey and sheep , as well as male and female servant . I have send my lord this message in the hope of gain your favor .      when the messenger return to Jacob , they say , we find your brother Esau . he be now come to meet you , and four hundred man be with he .     Jacob be very much frightened . in his anxiety , he divide the people who be with he , as well as his flock , herd and camel , into two camp .      if Esau should come and attack one camp , he reason , the remain camp may still escape .      then Jacob pray : God of my father Abraham and God of my father Isaac ! you ,   Lord , who say to I , go back to your land and your relative , and I will be good to you .        I be unworthy of all the act of kindness and faithfulness that you have perform for your servant : although I cross the Jordan here with nothing but my staff , I have now grow into two camp .      save I from the hand of my brother , from the hand of Esau ! otherwise I fear that he will come and strike I down and the mother with the child .      you yourself say , I will be very good to you , and I will make your descendant like the sand of the sea , which be too numerous to count .      after pass the night there , Jacob select from what he have with he a present for his brother Esau :      two hundred she - goat and twenty he - goat ; two hundred ewe and twenty ram ;      thirty female camel and their young ; forty cow and ten bull ; twenty female donkey and ten male donkey .      he put these animal in the care of his servant , in separate herd , and he tell the servant , go on ahead of I , but keep some space between the herd .      he order the servant in the lead , when my brother Esau meet you and ask , to whom do you belong ? where be you go ? to whom do these animal ahead of you belong ?      tell he , to your servant Jacob , but they have be send as a gift to my lord Esau . Jacob himself be right behind we .      he also order the second servant and the third and all the other who follow behind the herd : thus and so you shall say to Esau , when you reach he ;      and also tell he , your servant Jacob be right behind we . for Jacob reason , if I first appease he with a gift that precede I , then later , when I face he , perhaps he will forgive I .      so the gift go on ahead of he , while he stay that night in the camp . Jacobs New Name .        that night , however , Jacob arise , take his two wife , with the two maidservant and his eleven child , and cross the ford of the Jabbok .      after he get they and bring they across the wadi and bring over what belong to he ,      Jacob be leave there alone . then a man    wrestle with he until the break of dawn .      when the man see that he could not prevail over he , he strike Jacobs hip at its socket , so that Jacobs socket be dislocate as he wrestle with he .        the man then say , let I go , for it be daybreak . but Jacob say , I will not let you go until you bless I .      what be your name ? the man ask . he answer , Jacob .        then the man say , you shall no long be name Jacob , but Israel ,    because you have contend with divine and human being and have prevail .      Jacob then ask he , please tell I your name . he answer , why do you ask for my name ? with that , he bless he .      Jacob name the place Peniel ,    because I have see God face to face , he say , yet my life have be spare .      at sunrise , as he leave Penuel , Jacob limp along because of his hip .      that be why , to this day , the Israelites do not eat the sciatic muscle that be on the hip socket , because he have strike Jacobs hip socket at the sciatic muscle .
