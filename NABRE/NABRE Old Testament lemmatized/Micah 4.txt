b '      in day to come   the mount of the   Lord s house shall be establish as the high mountain ;   it shall be raise above the hill , and people shall stream to it :     many nation shall come , and say , come , let we climb the   Lord s mountain ,   to the house of the God of Jacob , that he may instruct we in his way ,   that we may walk in his path . for from Zion shall go forth instruction ,   and the word of the   Lord   from Jerusalem .   he shall judge between many people   and set term for strong and distant nation ; they shall beat their sword into plowshare ,   and their spear into pruning hook ; one nation shall not raise the sword against another ,   nor shall they train for war again .   they shall all sit under their own vine ,   under their own fig tree , undisturbed ;   for the   Lord   of host have speak .    though all the people walk ,   each in the name of its god , we will walk in the name of the   Lord ,   our God , forever and ever .      on that day\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord \xe2\x80\x94   I will gather the lame , and I will assemble the outcast ,   and those whom I have afflict .   I will make of the lame a remnant ,   and of the weak a strong nation ; the   Lord   shall be king over they on Mount Zion ,   from now on and forever .      and you , o tower of the flock ,    hill of daughter Zion ! to you it shall come :   the former dominion shall be restore ,   the reign of daughter Jerusalem .     now why do you cry out so ?   be you without a king ?   or have your adviser perish , that you be seize with pain   like a woman in labor ?    Writhe , go into labor ,   o daughter Zion ,   like a woman give birth ; for now you shall leave the city   and camp in the field ; to Babylon you shall go ,   there you shall be rescue . there the   Lord   shall redeem you   from the hand of your enemy .      and now many nation be gather against you !   they say , let she be profane ,   let our eye see zion downfall !   but they do not know the thought of the   Lord ,   nor understand his plan : he have gather they   like sheaf to the threshing floor .   Arise and thresh , o daughter Zion ;   your horn I will make iron and your hoof I will make bronze ,   that you may crush many people ; you shall devote their spoil to the   Lord ,    their rich to the Lord of the whole earth .      now grieve , o grieve daughter !    they have lay siege against we ! with the rod they strike on the cheek   the ruler of Israel .
