b '    whoever fear the   Lord   will do this ;   whoever be practice in the Law will come to wisdom .   she will meet he like a mother ;   like a young bride she will receive he ,    she will feed he with the bread of learn ,   and give he the water of understanding to drink .    he will lean upon she and not fall ;   he will trust in she and not be put to shame .   she will exalt he above his neighbor ,   and in the assembly she will make he eloquent .   Joy and gladness he will find ,   and an everlasting name he will inherit .    the worthless will not attain she ,   and the haughty will not behold she .   she be far from the impious ;   liar never think of she .    praise be unseemly on the lip of sinner ,   for it have not be allot to they by God .   but praise be utter by the mouth of the wise ,   and its rightful owner teach it .    Free will    do not say : it be god do that I fall away ,   for what he hate he do not do .   do not say : he himself have lead I astray ,   for he have no need of the wicked .    abominable wickedness the   Lord   hate   and he do not let it happen to those who fear he .     God in the beginning create human being   and make they subject to their own free choice .    if you choose , you can keep the commandment ;   loyalty be do the will of God .   Set before you be fire and water ;   to whatever you choose , stretch out your hand .   before everyone be life and death ,   whichever they choose will be give they .      immense be the wisdom of the   Lord ;   mighty in power , he see all thing .   the eye of God behold his work ,   and he understand every human deed .    he never command anyone to sin ,   nor show leniency toward deceiver .
