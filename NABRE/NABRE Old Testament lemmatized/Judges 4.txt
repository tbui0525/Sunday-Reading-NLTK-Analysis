b '   Deborah and Barak .      the Israelites again do what be evil in the sight of the   Lord ; Ehud be dead .      so the   Lord   sell they into the power of the canaanite king , Jabin , who reign in Hazor . the general of his army be Sisera , who live in Harosheth - ha - goiim .         but the Israelites cry out to the   Lord ; for with his nine hundred iron chariot Jabin harshly oppress the Israelites for twenty year .     at that time the prophet Deborah , wife of Lappidoth , be judge Israel .      she use to sit under Deborahs palm tree , between Ramah and Bethel in the mountain region of Ephraim , where the Israelites come up to she for judgment .      she have Barak , son of Abinoam ,    summon from Kedesh of Naphtali . she say to he , this be what the   Lord , the God of Israel , command : go , march against Mount Tabor , and take with you ten thousand man from Naphtali and Zebulun .      I will draw Sisera , the general of Jabins army , out to you at the Wadi Kishon ,    together with his chariot and troop , and I will deliver they into your power .      but Barak answer she , if you come with I , I will go ; if you do not come with I , I will not go .      I will certainly go with you , she reply , but you will not gain glory for the expedition on which you be set out , for it be into a woman power that the   Lord   be go to sell Sisera . so Deborah arise and go with Barak and journey with he to Kedesh .     Barak summon Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh , and ten thousand man follow he .    Deborah also go up with he .       now Heber the Kenite have detach himself from Cain , the descendant of Hobab , Moses father - in - law ,    and have pitch his tent by the terebinth of Zaanannim , which be near Kedesh .     it be report to Sisera that Barak , son of Abinoam , have go up to Mount Tabor .      so Sisera call out all nine hundred of his iron chariot and all his force from Harosheth - ha - goiim to the Wadi Kishon .      Deborah then say to Barak , up ! this be the day on which the   Lord   have deliver Sisera into your power . the   Lord   marche before you . so Barak go down Mount Tabor , follow by his ten thousand man .      and the   Lord   throw Sisera and all his chariot and force into a panic before Barak .    Sisera himself dismount from his chariot and flee on foot ,      but Barak pursue the chariot and the army as far as Harosheth - ha - goiim . the entire army of Sisera fall beneath the sword , not even one man survive .     Sisera flee on foot to the tent of Jael , wife of Heber the Kenite , for there be peace between Jabin , king of Hazor , and the family of Heber the Kenite .      Jael go out to meet Sisera and say to he , turn aside , my lord , turn aside with I ; do not be afraid . so he go into her tent , and she cover he with a rug .      he say to she , please give I a little water to drink . I be thirsty . so she open a skin of milk , give he a drink , and then cover he .        stand at the entrance of the tent , he say to she . if anyone come and ask , be there someone here ? say , no !      Jael , wife of Heber , get a tent peg and take a mallet in her hand . when Sisera be in a deep sleep from exhaustion , she approach he stealthily and drive the peg through his temple and down into the ground , and he die .        then when Barak come in pursuit of Sisera , Jael go out to meet he and say to he , come , I will show you the man you be look for . so he go in with she , and there lie Sisera dead , with the tent peg through his temple .     thus on that day God humble the Canaanite king , Jabin , before the Israelites ;      their power weigh ever more heavily on he , until at length they finish off the Canaanite king , Jabin .
