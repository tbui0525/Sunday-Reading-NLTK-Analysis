b '   Digression on false worship   foolish by nature be all who be in ignorance of God ,   and who from the good thing see do not succeed in know the one who be ,    and from study the work do not discern the artisan ;    instead either fire , or wind , or the swift air ,   or the circuit of the star , or the mighty water ,   or the luminary of heaven , the governor    of the world , they consider god .    now if out of joy in their beauty they think they god ,   let they know how far more excellent be the Lord than these ;   for the original source of beauty fashion they .    or if they be strike by their might and energy ,   let they realize from these thing how much more powerful be the one who make they .    for from the greatness and the beauty of create thing   their original author , by analogy , be see .   but yet , for these the blame be less ;   for they have go astray perhaps ,   though they seek God and wish to find he .   for they search busily among his work ,   but be distract by what they see , because the thing see be fair .   but again , not even these be pardonable .   for if they so far succeed in knowledge   that they could speculate about the world ,   how do they not more quickly find its Lord ?    B. Idolatry    but wretched be they , and in dead thing be their hope ,   who term god thing make by human hand : gold and silver , the product of art , and image of beast ,   or useless stone , the work of an ancient hand .     the Carpenter and Wooden Idols   a carpenter may cut down a suitable tree    and skillfully scrape off all its bark , and deftly ply his art   produce something fit for daily use ,    and use the scrap from his handiwork   in prepare his food , and have his fill ;   then the good - for - nothing refuse from these remnant ,   crooked wood grow full of knot ,   he take and carve to occupy his spare time .   this wood he model with mindless skill ,   and pattern it on the image of a human being    or make it resemble some worthless beast . when he have daub it with red and crimson its surface with red stain ,   and daub over every blemish in it ,    he make a fitting shrine for it   and put it on the wall , fasten it with a nail .    thus he provide for it lest it fall down ,   know that it can not help itself ;   for , truly , it be an image and need help .    but when he pray about his good or marriage or child ,    he be not ashamed to address the thing without a soul . for vigor he invoke the powerless ;    for life he entreat the dead ; for aid he beseech the wholly incompetent ;   for travel , something that can not even walk ;   for profit in business and success with his hand   he ask power of a thing with hand utterly powerless .
