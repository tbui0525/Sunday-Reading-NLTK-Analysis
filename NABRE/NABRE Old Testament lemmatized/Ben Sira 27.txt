b '    for the sake of profit many sin ,   and the struggle for wealth blind the eye .    a stake will be drive between fit stones\xe2\x80\x94   sin will be wedge in between buy and selling .   unless one hold fast to the fear of the Lord ,   with sudden swiftness will one house be throw down .     when a sieve be shake , the husk appear ;   so do people fault when they speak .    the furnace test the potter vessel ;   the test of a person be in conversation .    the fruit of a tree show the care it have have ;   so speech disclose the bent of a person heart .    praise no one before he speak ,   for it be then that people be test .     if you strive after justice , you will attain it ,   and wear it like a splendid robe .   bird nest with their own kind ,   and honesty come to those who work at it .   a lion lie in wait for prey ,   so do sin for evildoer .     the conversation of the godly be always wisdom ,   but the fool change like the moon .   limit the time you spend among the stupid ,   but frequent the company of the thoughtful .   the conversation of fool be offensive ,   and their laughter be wanton sin .   their oath - fill talk make the hair stand on end ,   and their brawl make one stop the ear .   the wrangling of the proud end in bloodshed ,   and their cursing be painful to hear .      whoever betray a secret destroy confidence ,    and will never find a congenial friend .    cherish your friend , keep faith with he ;   but if you betray his secret , do not go after he ;   for as one might kill another ,   you have kill your neighbor friendship .   like a bird release from your hand ,   you have let your friend go and can not recapture he .   do not go after he , for he be far away ,   and have escape like a gazelle from a snare .   for a wound can be bandage , and an insult forgive ,   but whoever betray secret do hopeless damage .     Malice , Anger and Vengeance   whoever have shifty eye plot mischief   and those who know he will keep their distance ;   in your presence he use honeyed talk ,   and admire your word , but later he change his tone   and twist the word to your ruin .    I have hate many thing but not as much as he ,   and the Lord hate he as well .    a stone fall back on the head of the one who throw it high ,    and a treacherous blow cause many wound .   whoever dig a pit fall into it ,   and whoever lay a snare be catch in it .    the evil anyone do will recoil on he   without know how it come upon he .     mockery and abuse will befall the arrogant ,   and vengeance lie in wait for they like a lion .   those who rejoice in the downfall of the godly will be catch in a snare ,   and pain will consume they before they die .   Wrath and anger , these also be abomination ,   yet a sinner hold on to they .             '
