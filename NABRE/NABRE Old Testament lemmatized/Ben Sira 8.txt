b '   Prudence in deal with other    do not contend with the mighty ,   lest you fall into their power .   do not quarrel with the rich ,   lest they pay out the price of your downfall . for gold have unsettle many ,   and wealth pervert the character of prince .      do not quarrel with loud - mouth ,   or heap wood upon their fire .     do not associate with the senseless ,   lest your ancestor be insult .     do not reproach one who turn away from sin ;    remember , we all be guilty .    do not insult one who be old ,   for some of we will also grow old .   do not rejoice when someone die ;   remember , we be all to be gather in .     do not neglect the discourse of the wise ,    but busy yourself with their proverb ; for in this way you will acquire the training   to stand in the presence of prince .   do not reject the tradition of the elder   which they have hear from their ancestor ; for from it you will learn   how to answer when the need arise .     do not kindle the coal of sinner ,   lest you be burn in their flame fire .   do not give ground before scoundrel ;   it will set they in ambush against you .    do not lend to one more powerful than yourself ;   or if you lend , count it as lose .    do not give collateral beyond your mean ;   consider any collateral a debt you must pay .     do not go to court against a judge ,   for the case will be settle in his favor .   do not travel with the ruthless   lest they weigh you down with calamity ; for they will only go their own way ,   and through their folly you will also perish .   do not defy the quick - temper ,   or ride with they through the desert . for bloodshed be nothing to they ;   when there be no one to help , they will destroy you .     do not take counsel with simpleton ,   for they can not keep a confidence .   before a stranger do nothing that should be keep secret ,   for you do not know what it will produce later on .     open your heart to no one ,   do not banish your happiness .
