b '   the servant of the Lord   here be my servant    whom I uphold ,   my choose one with whom I be pleased . upon he I have put my spirit ;   he shall bring forth justice to the nation .    he will not cry out , nor shout ,   nor make his voice hear in the street .   a bruised reed    he will not break ,   and a dimly burn wick he will not quench .   he will faithfully bring forth justice .   he will not grow dim or be bruise   until he establish justice on the earth ;   the coastland    will wait for his teaching .     thus say God , the   Lord ,   who create the heaven and stretch they out ,   who spread out the earth and its produce , who give breath to its people   and spirit to those who walk on it :   I , the   Lord , have call you for justice ,   I have grasp you by the hand ; I form you , and set you   as a covenant for the people ,   a light for the nation ,    to open the eye of the blind ,   to bring out prisoner from confinement ,   and from the dungeon , those who live in darkness .   I be the   Lord ,   Lord   be my name ;   my glory I give to no other ,   nor my praise to idol .   see , the early thing have come to pass ,   new one I now declare ; before they spring forth   I announce they to you .    the Lords Purpose for Israel   sing to the   Lord   a new song ,   his praise from the end of the earth : let the sea and what fill it resound ,   the coastland , and those who dwell in they .   let the wilderness and its city cry out ,   the village where Kedar    dwell ; let the inhabitant of Sela exult ,   and shout from the top of the mountain .   let they give glory to the   Lord ,   and utter his praise in the coastland .     the   Lord   go forth like a warrior ,   like a man of war he stir up his fury ; he shout out his battle cry ,   against his enemy he show his might :    for a long time I have keep silent ,   I have say nothing , hold myself back ; now I cry out like a woman in labor ,   gasp and panting .    I will lay waste mountain and hill ,   all their undergrowth I will dry up ; I will turn the river into marsh ,   and the marsh I will dry up .    I will lead the blind on a way they do not know ;   by path they do not know I will guide they . I will turn darkness into light before they ,   and make crooked way straight . these be my promise :   I make they , I will not forsake they .      they shall be turn back in utter shame   who trust in idol ; who say to molten image ,   you be our god .   you deaf one , listen ,    you blind one , look and see !   who be blind but my servant ,   or deaf like the messenger I send ? who be blind like the one I restore ,   blind like the servant of the   Lord ?   you see many thing but do not observe ;   ear open , but do not hear .   it be the   Lord s will for the sake of his justice   to make his teaching great and glorious .     this be a people    plunder and despoiled ,   all of they trap in hole ,   hide away in prison . they be take as plunder , with no one to rescue they ,   as spoil , with no one to say , give back !   who among you will give ear to this ,   listen and pay attention from now on ?   who be it that give Jacob to be despoiled ,   Israel to the plunderer ?   be it not the   Lord , against whom we have sin ?   in his way they refuse to walk ,   his teaching they would not heed .   so he pour out wrath upon they ,   his anger , and the fury of battle ; it blaze all around they , yet they do not realize ,   it burn they , but they do not take it to heart .
