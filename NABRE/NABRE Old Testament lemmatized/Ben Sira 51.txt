b '   a prayer of Thanksgiving   I give you thank ,   Lord   and King ,    I praise you , God my savior ! I declare your name , refuge of my life ,     because you have ransom my life from death ; you hold back my body from the pit ,   and deliver my foot from the power of Sheol .     you have preserve I from the scourge of the slanderous tongue ,   and from the lip of those who go over to falsehood . you be with I against those who rise up against I ;    you have rescue I accord to your abundant mercy   from the snare of those who look for my downfall ,   and from the power of those who seek my life .    from many danger you have save I ,    from flame that beset I on every side ,   from the midst of fire till there be not a whiff of it ,     from the deep belly of Sheol , from deceive lip and painter of lie ,    from the arrow of a treacherous tongue .    I be at the point of death ,   my life be near the depth of Sheol ;    I turn every way , but there be no one to help ;   I look for support but there be none .    then I remember the mercy of the   Lord ,   his act of kindness through age past ; for he save those who take refuge in he ,   and rescue they from every evil .     so I raise my voice from the grave ;   from the gate of Sheol I cry for help .   I call out :   Lord , you be my Father ,   my champion , my savior ! do not abandon I in time of trouble ,   in the midst of storm and danger .    I will always praise your name   and remember you in prayer !    then the   Lord   hear my voice ,   and listen to my appeal .   he save I from every evil   and preserve I in time of trouble . for this reason I thank and praise he ;   I bless the name of the   Lord .     Ben Siras Pursuit of Wisdom    when I be young and innocent ,   I seek wisdom .    she come to I in her beauty ,   and until the end I will cultivate she .     as the blossom yield to ripen grape ,   the heart joy , my foot keep to the level path   because from early youth I be familiar with she .     in the short time I pay heed ,   I meet with great instruction .   since in this way I have profit ,   I will give my teacher grateful praise .     I resolve to tread her path ;   I have be jealous for the good and will not turn back .   I burn with desire for she ,   never relent . I become preoccupied with she ,   never weary of extoll she .    I spread out my hand to the heaven   and I come to know her secret .   for she I purify my hand ;   in cleanness I attain to she .    at first acquaintance with she , I gain understanding   such that I will never forsake she .    my whole being be stir to seek she ;   therefore I have make she my prize possession .   the   Lord   have reward I with lip ,   with a tongue for praise he .     come aside to I , you untutore ,   and take up lodging in the house of instruction ;     how long will you deprive yourself of wisdom food ,   how long endure such bitter thirst ?   I open my mouth and speak of she :   gain wisdom for yourself at no cost .      take her yoke upon your neck ;   that your mind may receive her teaching . for she be close to those who seek she ,   and the one who be in earnest find she .      see for yourself ! I have labor only a little ,   but have find much .   acquire but a little instruction ,   and you will win silver and gold through she .     may your soul rejoice in Gods mercy ;   do not be ashamed to give he praise .   work at your task in due season ,   and in his own time God will give you your reward .
