b '   Sickness and Recovery of Hezekiah .      in those day ,    when Hezekiah be mortally ill , the prophet Isaiah , son of Amoz , come and say to he : thus say the   Lord : put your house in order , for you be about to die ; you shall not recover .        Hezekiah turn his face to the wall and pray to the   Lord :     ah ,   Lord , remember how faithfully and wholeheartedly I conduct myself in your presence , do what be good in your sight ! and Hezekiah weep bitterly .      then the word of the   Lord   come to Isaiah :      go , tell Hezekiah :    thus say the   Lord , the God of your father David : I have hear your prayer ; I have see your tear . now I will add fifteen year to your life .      I will rescue you and this city from the hand of the king of Assyria ; I will be a shield to this city .      this will be the sign for you from the   Lord   that the   Lord   will carry out the word he have speak :      see , I will make the shadow cast by the sun on the stairway to the terrace of Ahaz    go back the ten step it have advance . so the sun come back the ten step it have advance .     Hezekiahs Hymn of Thanksgiving .     the song of Hezekiah , king of Judah , after he have be sick and have recover from his illness :     in the noontime of life    I say ,   I must depart ! to the gate of Sheol I have be consign   for the rest of my year .    I say , I shall see the   Lord    no more   in the land of the living . nor look on any mortal   among those who dwell in the world .   my dwelling , like a shepherd tent ,   be strike down and bear away from I ; you have fold up my life , like a weaver   who sever I from the last thread .    from morning to night you make an end of I ;    I cry out even until the dawn . like a lion he break all my bone ;   from morning to night you make an end of I .    like a swallow I chirp ;   I moan like a dove . my eye grow weary look heavenward :   Lord , I be overwhelmed ; go security for I !    what be I to say or tell he ?   he be the one who have do it ! all my sleep have flee ,   because of the bitterness of my soul .   those live whom the   Lord   protect ;   yours be the life of my spirit . you have give I health and restore my life !    peace in place of bitterness ! you have preserve my life   from the pit of destruction ; behind your back   you cast all my sin .     for it be not Sheol that give you thank ,   nor death that praise you ; neither do those who go down into the pit   await your kindness .    the living , the living give you thank ,   as I do today . parent declare to their child ,   o God , your faithfulness .   the   Lord   be there to save we .   we shall play our music in the house of the   Lord   all the day of our life .      then Isaiah say , bring a poultice of fig and apply it to the boil for his recovery .      Hezekiah ask , what be the sign that I shall go up to the house of the   Lord ?             '
