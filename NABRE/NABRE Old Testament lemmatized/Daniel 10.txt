b '   an angelic Vision .      in the third year of Cyrus , king of Persia , a revelation be give to Daniel , who have be name Belteshazzar . the revelation be certain : a great war ;    he understand this from the vision .      in those day , I , Daniel , mourn three full week .      I eat no savory food , take no meat or wine , and do not anoint myself at all until the end of the three week .     on the twenty - fourth day of the first month    I be on the bank of the great river , the Tigris .      as I look up , I see a man    dress in linen with a belt of fine gold around his waist .        his body be like chrysolite , his face shine like lightning , his eye be like fiery torch , his arm and foot look like burnished bronze , and the sound of his voice be like the roar of a multitude .      I alone , Daniel , see the vision ; but great fear seize those who be with I ; they flee and hide themselves , although they do not see the vision .      so I be leave alone to see this great vision . no strength remain in I ; I turn the color of death and be powerless .      when I hear the sound of his voice , I fall face forward unconscious .     but then a hand touch I , raise I to my hand and knee .      Daniel , beloved , he say to I , understand the word which I be speak to you ; stand up , for my mission now be to you . when he say this to I , I stand up tremble .      do not fear , Daniel , he continue ; from the first day you make up your mind to acquire understanding and humble yourself before God , your prayer be hear . because of it I start out ,      but the prince of the kingdom of Persia    stand in my way for twenty - one day , until finally Michael , one of the chief prince , come to help I . I leave he there with the prince of the kingdom of Persia ,      and come to make you understand what shall happen to your people in the last day ; for there be yet a vision concern those day .     while he be speak thus to I , I fall forward and keep silent .      then something like a hand touch my lip ; I open my mouth and say to the one stand before I , my lord , I be seize with pang at the vision and I be powerless .      how can my lords servant speak with you , my lord ? for now no strength or even breath be leave in I .      the one who look like a man touch I again and strengthen I , say ,      do not fear , belove . peace ! take courage and be strong . when he speak to I , I grow strong and say , speak , my lord , for you have strengthen I .      do you know , he ask , why I have come to you ? soon I must fight the prince of Persia again . when I leave , the prince of Greece will come ;      but I shall tell you what be write in the book of truth .    no one support I against these except Michael ,    your prince ,    and in the first year of Darius the Mede I stand to strengthen he and be his refuge .
