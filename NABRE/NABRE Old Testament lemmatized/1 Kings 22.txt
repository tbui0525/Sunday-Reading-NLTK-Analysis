Jehoshaphat answer the king of Israel , you and I be as one , and your people and my people , your horse and my horse as well .    Prophetic Condemnation .     Jehoshaphat also say to the king of Israel , seek the word of the   Lord   at once .      the king of Israel assemble the prophet , about four hundred of they , and ask , shall I go to fight against Ramoth - gilead or shall I refrain ? they say , Attack . the Lord will give it into the power of the king .        but Jehoshaphat say , be there no other prophet of the   Lord   here we might consult ?      the king of Israel answer , there be one other man through whom we might consult the   Lord ; but I hate he because he prophesy not good but evil about I . he be Micaiah , son of Imlah . Jehoshaphat say , let not the king say that .      so the king of Israel call an official and say to he , get Micaiah , son of Imlah , at once .     the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat , king of Judah , be seat , each on his throne , clothe in their robe of state in the square at the entrance of the gate of Samaria , and all the prophet be prophesy before they .       Zedekiah , son of Chenaanah , make himself two horn of iron    and say , the   Lord   say , with these you shall gore Aram until you have destroy they .      the other prophet prophesy in a similar vein , say : Attack Ramoth - gilead and conquer ! the   Lord   will give it into the power of the king .     meanwhile , the messenger who have go to call Micaiah say to he , look now , the prophet be unanimously predict good for the king . let your word be the same as any of theirs ; speak a good word .      Micaiah say , as the   Lord   live , I shall speak whatever the   Lord   tell I .     when he come to the king , the king say to he , Micaiah , shall we go to fight at Ramoth - gilead , or shall we refrain ? he say , attack and conquer ! the   Lord   will give it into the power of the king .      but the king answer he , how many time must I adjure you to tell I nothing but the truth in the name of the   Lord ?       so Micaiah say : I see all Israel   scatter on the mountain ,   like sheep without a shepherd , and the   Lord   say ,   these have no master !   let each of they go back home in peace .     the king of Israel say to Jehoshaphat , do I not tell you , he do not prophesy good about I , but only evil ?       Micaiah continue : therefore hear the word of the   Lord : I see the   Lord   seat on his throne , with the whole host of heaven stand to his right and to his left .      the   Lord   ask : who will deceive Ahab , so that he will go up and fall on Ramoth - gilead ?    and one say this , another that ,      until this spirit come forth and stand before the   Lord , say , I will deceive he . the   Lord   ask : how ?      he answer , I will go forth and become a lie spirit in the mouth of all his prophet . the   Lord   reply : you shall succeed in deceive he . go forth and do this .      so now , the   Lord   have put a lie spirit in the mouth of all these prophet of your ; the   Lord   himself have decree evil against you .     Thereupon Zedekiah , son of Chenaanah , come up and strike Micaiah on the cheek , say , have the spirit of the   Lord , then , leave I to speak with you ?      Micaiah say , you shall find out on the day you go into an inner room to hide .      the king of Israel then say , seize Micaiah and take he back to Amon , prefect of the city , and to Joash , the king son ,      and say , this be the king order : put this man in prison and feed he scanty ration of bread and water until I come back in safety .       but Micaiah say , if you return in safety , the   Lord   have not speak through I .
