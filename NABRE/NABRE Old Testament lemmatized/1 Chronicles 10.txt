b '   death of Saul and his son .      now the Philistines go to war against Israel , and Israel flee before they , and they fall , slay on Mount Gilboa .      the Philistines press hard after Saul and his son . when the Philistines have strike down Jonathan , Abinadab , and Malchishua , son of Saul ,      the fury of the battle converge on Saul . then the archer hit he , and he be severely wound .     Saul say to his armor - bearer , draw your sword and run I through ; otherwise these uncircumcised will come and abuse I . but the armor - bearer , badly frightened , refuse , so Saul take his own sword and fall upon it .      when the armor - bearer see that Saul be dead , he too fall upon his sword and die .      thus Saul , and his three son , his whole house , die together .      when all the Israelites in the valley see that Saul and his son have flee and that they have die , they abandon their city and flee . then the Philistines come and live in those city .     on the follow day , when the Philistines come to strip the slain , they find Saul and his son fall on Mount Gilboa .      they strip he , and take his head and his armor ; these they send throughout the land of the Philistines to bring the good news to their idol and to the people .      they put his armor in the temple of their god , but his skull they impale at the temple of Dagon .    Burial of Saul .     when all the inhabitant of Jabesh - gilead hear all that the Philistines have do to Saul ,      all their warrior set out , recover the corpse of Saul and his son , and bring they to Jabesh . they bury their bone under the oak of Jabesh , and fast for seven day .       thus Saul die because of his treason against the   Lord   in disobey his word , and also because he have seek counsel from a ghost ,        rather than from the   Lord . therefore the   Lord   take his life , and turn his kingdom over to David , the son of Jesse .
