b ' prayer of a person falsely accuse   for the leader . a psalm of David .    I   o God , whom I praise , do not be silent ,    for wicked and treacherous mouth attack I . they speak against I with lie tongue ;    with hateful word they surround I ,   attack I without cause .   in return for my love they slander I ,   even though I pray for they .   they repay I evil for good ,   hatred for my love .     II   appoint an evil one over he ,   an accuser    to stand at his right hand ,   that he may be judge and find guilty ,   that his plea may be in vain .   may his day be few ;   may another take his office .    may his child be fatherless ,   his wife , a widow .    may his child wander and beg ,   drive from their hovel .   may the usurer snare all he own ,   stranger plunder all he earn .   may no one treat he with mercy   or pity his fatherless child .   may his posterity be destroy ,    their name root out in the next generation .   may his father guilt be mention to the   Lord ;   his mother sin not root out .    may their guilt be always before the   Lord ,    till their memory be banish from the earth ,    for he do not remember to show mercy ,   but hound the wretched poor   and bring death to the brokenhearted .   he love cursing ; may it come upon he ;   he hate blessing ; may none come to he .   may curse clothe he like a robe ;   may it enter his belly like water ,   his bone like oil .   may it be near as the clothe he wear ,   as the belt always around he .      may this be the reward for my accuser from the   Lord ,   for those speak evil against I .    III   but you ,   Lord , be my Lord ,   deal kindly with I for your name sake ;   in your great mercy rescue I .   for I be poor and needy ;   my heart be pierce within I .   like a lengthen shadow I be go ,   I be shake off like the locust .   my knee totter from fast ;    my flesh have waste away .   I have become a mockery to they ;   when they see I , they shake their head .   help I ,   Lord , my God ;   save I in your mercy .   make they know this be your hand ,   that you ,   Lord , have do this .   though they curse , may you bless ;   arise , shame they , that your servant may rejoice .   Clothe my accuser with disgrace ;   make they wear their shame like a mantle .   I will give fervent thank to the   Lord ;   before a crowd I will praise he .    for he stand at the right hand of the poor   to save he from those who pass judgment on he .             '
