b '   a Prayer for Gods People    come to our aid , o God of the universe ,    and put all the nation in dread of you !   raise your hand against the foreign people ,   that they may see your mighty deed .   as you have use we to show they your holiness ,    so now use they to show we your glory .   thus they will know , as we know ,   that there be no God but you .     give new sign and work new wonder ;    show forth the splendor of your right hand and arm .   Rouse your anger , pour out wrath ;    humble the enemy , scatter the foe .    Hasten the ending , appoint the time ,   and let people proclaim your mighty deed .   let rage fire consume the fugitive ,   and your people oppressor meet destruction .   crush the head of the hostile ruler   who say , there be no one besides I .     gather all the tribe of Jacob ,     that they may inherit the land as in day of old .   show mercy to the people call by your name :   Israel , whom you name your firstborn .    take pity on your holy city :   Jerusalem , your dwelling place .    fill Zion with your majesty ,   your temple with your glory .     give evidence of your deed of old ;   fulfill the prophecy speak in your name .   reward those who have hope in you ,   and let your prophet be prove true .   hear the prayer of your servant ,   accord to your good will toward your people . thus all the end of the earth will know   that you be the eternal God .    Choice of Associates    the throat can swallow any food ,   yet some food be more agreeable than other .   the palate test delicacy put forward as gift ,   so do a keen mind test deceitful tidbit .   one with a tortuous heart bring about grief ,   but an experienced person can turn the table on he .     a woman will accept any man as husband ,   but one woman will be preferable to another .   a woman beauty make her husband face light up ,   for it surpass all else that delight the eye .    and if , besides , her speech be soothe ,   her husband lot be beyond that of mortal man .   a wife be her husband rich treasure ,   a help like himself and a staunch support .    a vineyard with no hedge will be overrun ;   and a man with no wife become a homeless wanderer .   who will trust an armed band   that shift from city to city ? or a man who have no nest ,   who lodge wherever night overtake he ?
