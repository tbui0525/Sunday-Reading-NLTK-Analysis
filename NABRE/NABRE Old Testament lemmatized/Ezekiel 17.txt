b '   the Eagles and the Vine .     the word of the   Lord   come to I :      Son of man , propose a riddle , and tell this proverb to the house of Israel :      thus say the Lord   God : the great eagle , with wide wingspan   and long feather , with thick plumage ,   many - hued , come to Lebanon . he pluck the crest of the cedar ,     break off its topmost branch , and bring it to a land of merchant ,   set it in a city of trader .   then he take some native seed   and plant it in fertile soil ; a shoot beside plentiful water ,   like a willow he plant it ,    that it might sprout and become a vine ,   dense and low - lying , with its branch turn toward he ,   its root beneath it . thus it become a vine , produce branch ,   and put forth shoot .   then another great eagle appear ,   with wide wingspan , rich in plumage , and see ! this vine bend its root to he ,   send out branch for he to water . from the bed where it be plant ,     it be transplant to a fertile field by abundant water , to produce branch ,   to bear fruit , to become a majestic vine .   say : thus say the Lord   God : can it thrive ? will he not tear up its root   and strip its fruit ? then all its green leave will wither\xe2\x80\x94   neither strong arm nor mighty nation   be need to uproot it .   true , it be plant ; but will it thrive ?   will it not wither up when the east wind strike it ,   wither in the very bed where it sprout ?       the word of the   Lord   come to I :     now say to the rebellious house :   do you not understand this ? tell they ! the king of Babylon come to Jerusalem   and take away its king and official   and bring they to he in Babylon .    after remove the noble from the land ,   he then take one of the royal line and make a covenant with he ,   bind he under oath ,    to be a humble kingdom ,   without high aspiration ,   to keep his covenant and so survive .   but this one rebel against he   by send envoy to Egypt to obtain horse and a mighty army .   can he thrive ? can he escape if he do this ?   can he break a covenant and go free ?    as I live\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the Lord   God \xe2\x80\x94   in the house of the king who set he up to rule , whose oath he ignore and whose covenant he break ,   there in Babylon I swear he shall die !    Pharaoh shall not help he on the day of battle ,   with a great force and mighty horde , when ramp be throw up and siege work build   for the cutting down of many life .   he ignore his oath , break his covenant ;   even though he give his hand , he do all these things\xe2\x80\x94   he shall not escape !    therefore , thus say the Lord   God :   as I live , my oath which he spurn , and my covenant which he break ,   I will bring down on his head .   I will spread my net over he ,   and he will be catch in my snare . I will bring he to Babylon   to judge he there   because he break faith with I .    any among his force who escape   will fall by the sword , and whoever might survive   will be scatter to the wind .   thus you will know that I the   Lord   have speak .   thus say the Lord   God : I , too , will pluck from the crest of the cedar   the high branch . from the top a tender shoot   I will break off and transplant    on a high , lofty mountain .   on the mountain height of Israel   I will plant it . it shall put forth branch and bear fruit ,   and become a majestic cedar . every small bird will nest under it ,   all kind of winged bird will dwell   in the shade of its branch .    every tree of the field will know   that I be the   Lord . I bring low the high tree ,   lift high the lowly tree , Wither up the green tree ,   and make the dry tree bloom .   as I , the   Lord , have speak , so will I do !             '
