b '    wine be arrogant , strong drink be riotous ;   none who be intoxicate by they be wise .     the terror of a king be like the roar of a lion ;    those who incur his anger forfeit their life .   a person gain honor by avoid strife ,   while every fool start a quarrel .    in seedtime sluggard do not plow ;   when they look for the harvest , it be not there .   the intention of the human heart be deep water ,   but the intelligent draw it forth .     many say , my loyal friend ,   but who can find someone worthy of trust ?   the just walk in integrity ;   happy be their child after they !   a king seat on the throne of judgment   dispel all evil with his glance .    who can say , I have make my heart clean ,    I be cleanse of my sin ?    vary weight , vary measure ,   be both an abomination to the   Lord .    in their action even child can playact   though their deed be blameless and right .    the ear that hear , the eye that sees\xe2\x80\x94   the   Lord   have make they both .    do not love sleep lest you be reduce to poverty ;   keep your eye open , have your fill of food .   bad , bad ! say the buyer ,   then go away only to boast .    one can put on gold and abundant jewel ,   but wise lip be the most precious ornament .    take the garment of the one who become surety for a stranger ;    if for foreigner , exact the pledge !    Bread earn by deceit be sweet ,   but afterward the mouth be fill with gravel .   plan make with advice succeed ;   with wise direction wage your war .   a slanderer reveal secret ;   so have nothing to do with a babbler !   those who curse father or mother\xe2\x80\x94   their lamp will go out    in the dead of night .    possession greedily guard at the outset   will not be bless in the end .    do not say , I will repay evil !   wait for the   Lord , who will help you .     vary weight be an abomination to the   Lord ,   and false scale be not good .    our step be from the   Lord ;    how , then , can mortal understand their way ?    it be a trap to pledge rashly a sacred gift ,   and after a vow , then to reflect .    a wise king winnow the wicked ,   and thresh they under the cartwheel .    a lamp from the   Lord   be human life - breath ;   it search through the inmost being .    his steadfast loyalty safeguard the king ,   and he uphold his throne by justice .    the glory of the young be their strength ,   and the dignity of the old be gray hair .    Evil be cleanse away by bloody lash ,   and a scourge to the inmost being .             '
