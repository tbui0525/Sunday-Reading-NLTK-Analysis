b '   Exhortation to seek wisdom    Hear , therefore , king , and understand ;    learn , you magistrate    of the earth expanse !   give ear , you who have power over multitude   and lord it over throng of people !   because authority be give you by the Lord   and sovereignty by the most high ,   who shall probe your work and scrutinize your counsel !    because , though you be minister of his kingdom , you do not judge rightly ,   and do not keep the law ,    nor walk accord to the will of God ,   terribly and swiftly he shall come against you ,   because severe judgment await the exalted\xe2\x80\x94   for the lowly may be pardon out of mercy    but the mighty shall be mightily put to the test .   for the Ruler of all show no partiality ,   nor do he fear greatness ,   because he himself make the great as well as the small ,   and provide for all alike ;    but for those in power a rigorous scrutiny impend .     to you , therefore , o prince , be my word address    that you may learn wisdom and that you may not fall away .   for those who keep the holy precept hallow will be find holy ,   and those learn in they will have ready a response .    Desire therefore my word ;   long for they and you will be instruct .     Resplendent and unfading be wisdom ,   and she be readily perceive by those who love she ,   and find by those who seek she .    she hasten to make herself know to those who desire she ;     one who watch for she at dawn will not be disappoint ,   for she will be find sit at the gate .   for set your heart on she be the perfection of prudence ,   and whoever keep vigil for she be quickly free from care ;   because she make her round , seek those worthy of she ,   and graciously appear to they on the way ,   and go to meet they with full attention .       for the first step toward Wisdom be an earnest desire for discipline ;     then , care for discipline be love of she ;   love mean the keeping of her law ; to observe her law be the basis for incorruptibility ;    and incorruptibility make one close to God ;    thus the desire for wisdom lead to a kingdom .   if , then , you find pleasure in throne and scepter , you prince of people ,   honor wisdom , that you may reign as king forever .    introduction   now what wisdom be , and how she come to be I shall proclaim ;   and I shall conceal no secret from you , but from the very beginning I shall search out   and bring to light knowledge of she ;   I shall not diverge from the truth .    neither shall I admit consume jealousy to my company ,   because that can have no fellowship with Wisdom .    a multitude of the wise be the safety of the world ,   and a prudent king , the stability of the people ;     so take instruction from my word , to your profit .
