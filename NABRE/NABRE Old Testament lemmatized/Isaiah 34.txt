b ' F. the Lord , Zions Avenger   chapter 34 judgment upon Edom   come near , nation , and listen ;   be attentive , you people ! let the earth and what fill it listen ,   the world and all it produce .    the   Lord   be angry with all the nation ,   enrage against all their host ; he have place they under the ban ,   give they up to slaughter .    their slain shall be cast out ,   their corpse shall send up a stench ;   the mountain shall run with their blood ,    all the host of heaven shall rot ;   the heaven shall be roll up like a scroll . all their host shall wither away ,   as the leaf wilt on the vine ,   or as the fig wither on the tree .    when my sword have drink its fill in the heaven ,   it shall come down upon Edom for judgment ,   upon a people under my ban .    the   Lord   have a sword sate with blood ,   greasy with fat , with the blood of lamb and goat ,   with the fat of ram kidney ; for the   Lord   have a sacrifice in Bozrah ,   a great slaughter in the land of Edom .    wild oxen shall be strike down with fatling ,   and bullock with bull ; their land shall be soak with blood ,   and their soil greasy with fat .    for the   Lord   have a day of vengeance ,   a year of requital for the cause of Zion .    edom stream shall be change into pitch ,   its soil into sulfur ,   and its land shall become burn pitch ;   Night and day it shall not be quench ,   its smoke shall rise forever . from generation to generation it shall lie waste ,   never again shall anyone pass through it .    but the desert owl and hoot owl shall possess it ,   the screech owl and raven shall dwell in it . the   Lord   will stretch over it the measure line of chaos ,   the plumb line of confusion .     its noble shall be no more ,   nor shall king be proclaim there ;   all its prince be go .    its castle shall be overgrown with thorn ,   its fortress with thistle and brier . it shall become an abode for jackal ,   a haunt for ostrich .    Wildcats shall meet with desert beast ,   satyrs    shall call to one another ; there shall the lilith repose ,   and find for herself a place to rest .   there the hoot owl shall nest and lay egg ,   hatch they out and gather they in her shadow ; there shall the kite assemble ,   each with its mate .   search through the book of the   Lord    and read :   not one of these shall be lack , for the mouth of the   Lord   have order it ,   and his spirit gather they there .   it be he who cast the lot for they ;   his hand measure off    their portion ; they shall possess it forever ,   and dwell in it from generation to generation .
