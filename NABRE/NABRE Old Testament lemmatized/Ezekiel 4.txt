b '    Acts symbolic of Siege and Exile .      you , son of man , take a clay tablet ; place it in front of you , and draw on it a city , Jerusalem .      Lay siege to it : build up siege work , raise a ramp against it , pitch camp and set up batter ram all around it .      then take an iron pan and set it up as an iron wall between you and the city . set your face toward it and put it under siege . so you must lay siege to it as a sign for the house of Israel .        then lie down on your left side , while I place the guilt of the house of Israel upon you . as many day as you lie like this , you shall bear their guilt .      I allot you three hundred and ninety day    during which you must bear the guilt of the house of Israel , the same number of year they sin .      when you have complete this , you shall lie down a second time , on your right side to bear the guilt of the house of Judah forty day ; I allot you one day for each year .        turn your face toward the siege of Jerusalem , with bared arm    you shall prophesy against it .      see , I bind you with rope so that you can not turn from one side to the other until you have complete the day of your siege .       then take wheat and barley , bean and lentil , millet and spelt ; put they into a single pot and make they into bread . eat it for as many day as you lie upon your side , three hundred and ninety day .      the food you eat shall be twenty shekel a day by weight ; each day you shall eat it .      and the water you drink shall be the sixth of a hin    by measure ; each day you shall drink it .      and the barley cake you eat you must bake on human excrement in the sight of all .      the   Lord   say : thus the Israelites shall eat their food , unclean , among the nation where I drive they .        oh no , Lord   God , I protest . never have I defile myself nor have I eat carrion flesh or flesh tear by wild beast , nor from my youth till now have any unclean meat enter my mouth .        very well , he reply , I will let you use cow manure in place of human dung . you can bake your bread on that .      then he say to I : Son of man , I be about to break the staff of bread    in Jerusalem so they shall eat bread which they have weigh out anxiously and drink water which they have measure out fearfully .        because they lack bread and water they shall be devastate ; each and every one will waste away because of their guilt .
