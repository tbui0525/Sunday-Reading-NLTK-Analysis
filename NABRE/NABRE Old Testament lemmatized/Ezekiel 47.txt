b '   the wonderful Stream .      then he bring I back to the entrance of the temple , and there ! I see water flow out from under the threshold of the temple toward the east , for the front of the temple face east . the water flow out toward the right side of the temple to the south of the altar .        he bring I by way of the north gate and around the outside to the outer gate face east ; there I see water trickle from the southern side .      when he continue eastward with a measure cord in his hand , he measure off a thousand cubit and have I wade through the water ; it be ankle - deep .      he measure off another thousand cubit and once more have I wade through the water ; it be up to the knee . he measure another thousand cubit and have I wade through the water ; it be up to my waist .      once more he measure off a thousand cubit . now it be a river I could not wade across . the water have rise so high , I would have to swim\xe2\x80\x94a river that be impassable .      then he ask I , do you see this , son of man ? he bring I to the bank of the river and have I sit down .      as I be return , I see along the bank of the river a great many tree on each side .        he say to I , this water flow out into the eastern district , run down into the Arabah and empty into the polluted water of the sea    to freshen they .        wherever it flow , the river teem with every kind of live creature ; fish will abound . where these water flow they refresh ; everything live where the river go .      Fishermen will stand along its shore from En - gedi to En - eglaim ;    it will become a place for dry net , and it will abound with as many kind of fish as the Great Sea .        its marsh and swamp shall not be make fresh , but will be leave for salt .      along each bank of the river every kind of fruit tree will grow ; their leave will not wither , nor will their fruit fail . every month they will bear fresh fruit because the water of the river flow out from the sanctuary . their fruit be use for food , and their leave for healing .   the New Israel Boundaries of the Land .        thus say the Lord   God : these be the boundary of the land which you shall apportion among the twelve tribe of Israel , with Joseph have two portion .        you shall apportion it equally because I swear to give it to your ancestor as a heritage ; this land , then , be your heritage .         these be the border of the land : on the northern side , from the Great Sea in the direction of Hethlon , Lebo - hamath to Zedad ,      Berothah , and Sibraim , along the frontier of Damascus and Hamath , to Hazar - enon , on the border of Hauran .        thus the border extend from the sea to Hazar - enon , north of the border of Damascus , the frontier of Hamath to the north . this be the northern boundary .      the eastern border shall be between Damascus and Hauran , while the Jordan will form the border between Gilead and the land of Israel down to the eastern sea as far as Tamar . this be the eastern boundary .      the southern border shall go southward from Tamar to the water of Meribath - kadesh , on to the Wadi of Egypt , and into the Great Sea . this be the southern boundary .        the western border shall have the Great Sea as a boundary as far as a point opposite Lebo - hamath . this be the western boundary .    the Northern Portions .     you shall divide this land accord to the tribe of Israel .       you shall allot it as heritage for yourself and for the resident alien in your midst who have father child among you . you shall treat they like native Israelites ; along with you they shall receive a heritage among the tribe of Israel .      in whatever tribe the resident alien life , there you shall assign his heritage\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the Lord   God .
