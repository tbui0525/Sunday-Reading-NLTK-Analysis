b '    but your holy one have very great light ; and those other , who hear their voice but do not see their form ,   count they bl for not having suffer ;   and because they who formerly have be wrong do not harm they , they thank they ,   and because of the difference between they ,    plead with they .   instead of this , you furnish the flame pillar ,   a guide on the unknown way ,   and the mild sun for an honorable migration .     for they deserve to be deprive of light and imprison by darkness ,   they have keep your child confine ,   through whom the imperishable light of the law be to be give to the world .     Fifth example : death of the Egyptian Firstborn ; the Israelites be spare   when they determine to put to death the infant of the holy one ,   and when a single boy    have be cast forth and then save , as a reproof you carry off a multitude of their child   and make they perish all at once in the mighty water .    that night be know beforehand to our ancestor ,   so that , with sure knowledge of the oath in which they put their faith , they might have courage .    the expectation of your people   be the salvation of the righteous and the destruction of their foe .    for by the same mean with which you punish our adversary ,   you glorify we whom you have summon .    for in secret the holy child of the good be offer sacrifice   and carry out with one mind the divine institution ,   so that your holy one should share alike the same blessing and danger ,   once they have sing the ancestral hymn of praise .    but the discordant cry of their enemy echo back ,   and the piteous wail of mourn for child be bear to they .    and the slave be smite with the same retribution as the master ;   even the commoner suffer the same as the king .    and all alike by one common form of death   have countless dead ; for the living be not even sufficient for the burial ,   since at a single instant their most value offspring have be destroy .    for though they disbelieve at every turn on account of sorcery ,   at the destruction of the firstborn they acknowledge that this people    be Gods son .     for when peaceful stillness encompass everything   and the night in its swift course be half spend ,   your all - powerful word from heaven royal throne   leap into the doomed land ,     a fierce warrior bear the sharp sword of your inexorable decree , and alight , and fill every place with death ,   and touch heaven , while stand upon the earth .    then , at once , vision in horrible dream perturb they    and unexpected fear assail they ;   and cast half - dead , one here , another there ,   they reveal why they be die .   for the dream that disturb they have proclaim this beforehand ,   lest they perish unaware of why they endure such evil .     the trial of death touch even the righteous ,   and in the desert a plague strike the multitude ; yet not for long do the anger last .    for the blameless man    hasten to be their champion ,   bear the weapon of his special office ,   prayer and the propitiation of incense ; he withstand the wrath and put a stop to the calamity ,   show that he be your servant .   he overcome the bitterness   not by bodily strength , not by force of arm ; but by word he overcome the smiter ,    recall the swear covenant with their ancestor .    for when corpse have already fall one on another in heap ,   he stand in the midst and check the anger ,   and cut off its way to the living .    for on his full - length robe be the whole world ,   and ancestral glory be carve on the four row of stone ,   and your grandeur    be on the crown upon his head .    to these the destroyer yield , these he fear ;   for this sole trial of anger suffice .
