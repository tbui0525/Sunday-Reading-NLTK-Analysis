I be Abrahams servant , he begin .      the   Lord   have bless my master so abundantly that he have become wealthy ; he have give he flock and herd , silver and gold , male and female slave , and camel and donkey .      my master wife Sarah bear a son to my master in her old age , and he have give he everything he own .      my master put I under oath , say : you shall not take a wife for my son from the daughter of the Canaanites in whose land I live ;      instead , you must go to my father house , to my own family , to get a wife for my son .      when I ask my master , what if the woman will not follow I ?      he reply : the   Lord , in whose presence I have always walk , will send his angel with you and make your journey successful , and so you will get a wife for my son from my own family and my father house .        then you will be free from my curse . if you go to my family and they refuse you , then , too , you will be free from my curse .      when I come to the spring today , I say :   Lord , God of my master Abraham , please make successful the journey I be on .      while I stand here at the spring , if I say to a young woman who come out to draw water , please give I a little water from your jug ,      and she answer , drink , and I will draw water for your camel , too\xe2\x80\x94then she be the woman whom the   Lord   have decide upon for my master son .     I have scarcely finish say this to myself when Rebekah come out with a jug on her shoulder . after she go down to the spring and draw water , I say to she , please let I have a drink .      she quickly lower the jug she be carry and say , drink , and I will water your camel , too . so I drink , and she water the camel also .      when I ask she , whose daughter be you ? she answer , the daughter of Bethuel , son of Nahor , bear to Nahor by Milcah . so I put the ring on her nose and the bracelet on her wrist .      then I kneel and bow down to the   Lord , bless the   Lord , the God of my master Abraham , who have lead I on the right road to obtain the daughter of my master kinsman for his son .      now , if you will act with kindness and fidelity toward my master , let I know ; but if not , let I know that too .
