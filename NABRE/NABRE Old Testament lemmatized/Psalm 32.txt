b ' remission of sin    of David . a   maskil . I bless be the one whose fault be remove ,   whose sin be forgive .   bless be the man to whom the   Lord   impute no guilt ,   in whose spirit be no deceit .    II   because I keep silent ,    my bone waste away ;   I groan all day long .    for day and night your hand be heavy upon I ;   my strength wither as in dry summer heat . Selah   then I declare my sin to you ;   my guilt I do not hide .   I say , I confess my transgression to the   Lord ,   and you take away the guilt of my sin . Selah   therefore every loyal person should pray to you   in time of distress . though flood water    threaten ,   they will never reach he .    you be my shelter ; you guard I from distress ;   with joyful shout of deliverance you surround I . Selah    III   I will instruct you and show you the way you should walk ,   give you counsel with my eye upon you .   do not be like a horse or mule , without understanding ;   with bit and bridle their temper be curb ,   else they will not come to you .    IV   many be the sorrow of the wicked one ,   but mercy surround the one who trust in the   Lord .   be glad in the   Lord   and rejoice , you righteous ;   exult , all you upright of heart .
