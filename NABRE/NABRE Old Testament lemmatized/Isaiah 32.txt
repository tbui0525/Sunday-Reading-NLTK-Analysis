b '   the Kingdom of Justice   see , a king will reign justly   and prince will rule rightly .    each of they will be like a shelter from the wind ,   a refuge from the rain . they will be like stream of water in a dry country ,   like the shade of a great rock in a parched land .    the eye of those who see will not be close ;   the ear of those who hear will be attentive .    the hasty of heart shall take thought to know ,   and tongue of stutterer shall speak readily and clearly .   no more will the fool be call noble ,   nor the deceiver be consider honorable .    for the fool speak folly ,   his heart plan evil : godless action ,   perverse speech against the   Lord , let the hungry go empty   and the thirsty without drink .    the deceit of the deceiver be evil ,   he plan devious scheme : to ruin the poor with lie ,   and the needy when they plead their case .    but the noble plan noble deed ,   and in noble deed they persist .    the Women of Jerusalem   you woman so complacent , rise up and hear my voice ,   daughter so confident , give heed to my word .    in a little more than a year   your confidence will be shake ; for the vintage will fail ,   no fruit harvest will come in .    Tremble , you who be so complacent !   Shudder , you who be so confident ! Strip yourselves bare ,   with only a loincloth for cover .    beat your breast   for the pleasant field ,   for the fruitful vine ;    for the soil of my people ,   overgrown with thorn and brier ; for all the joyful house ,   the exultant city .    the castle    will be forsake ,   the noisy city deserted ; Citadel and tower will become wasteland forever ,   the joy of wild donkey , the pasture of flock ;     until the spirit from on high   be pour out on we . and the wilderness become a garden land   and the garden land seem as common as forest .    then judgment will dwell in the wilderness   and justice abide in the garden land .   the work of justice will be peace ;   the effect of justice , calm and security forever .    my people will live in peaceful country ,   in secure dwelling and quiet rest place .    and the forest will come down completely ,   the city will be utterly lay low .     happy be you who sow beside every stream ,   and let the ox and the donkey go freely !
