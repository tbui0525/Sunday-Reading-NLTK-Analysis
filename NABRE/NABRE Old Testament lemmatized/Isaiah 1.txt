b '    chapter 1    the vision which Isaiah , son of Amoz , see concern Judah and Jerusalem in the day of Uzziah , Jotham , Ahaz and Hezekiah , king of Judah .    Accusation and Appeal    Hear , o heaven , and listen , o earth ,   for the   Lord   speak : son have I raise and rear ,   but they have rebel against I !    an ox know its owner ,   and an ass ,    its master manger ; but Israel do not know ,   my people have not understand .    ah !    sinful nation , people laden with wickedness ,   evil offspring , corrupt child ! they have forsake the   Lord ,   spurn the Holy One of Israel ,   apostatize ,    why    would you yet be strike ,   that you continue to rebel ? the whole head be sick ,   the whole heart faint .   from the sole of the foot to the head   there be no sound spot in it ; just bruise and welt and ooze wound ,   not drain , or bandage ,   or ease with salve .   your country be waste ,   your city burn with fire ; your land\xe2\x80\x94before your eye   stranger devour it ,   a waste , like the devastation of Sodom .     and daughter Zion    be leave   like a hut in a vineyard , like a shed in a melon patch ,   like a city blockade .   if the   Lord   of host    have not   leave we a small remnant , we would have become as Sodom ,   would have resemble Gomorrah .       hear the word of the   Lord ,   prince of Sodom ! listen to the instruction of our God ,   people of Gomorrah !   what do I care for the multitude of your sacrifice ?   say the   Lord . I have have enough of whole - burn ram   and fat of fatling ; in the blood of calf , lamb , and goat   I find no pleasure .    when you come to appear before I ,   who ask these thing of you ?   trample my court no more !   to bring offering be useless ;   incense be an abomination to I . new moon and sabbath , call assemblies\xe2\x80\x94   festive convocation with wickedness\xe2\x80\x94   these I can not bear .    your new moon and festival I detest ;    they weigh I down , I tire of the load .   when you spread out your hand ,   I will close my eye to you ; though you pray the more ,   I will not listen . your hand be full of blood !      wash yourselves clean ! put away your misdeed from before my eye ;   cease do evil ;    learn to do good . make justice your aim : redress the wrong ,   hear the orphan plea , defend the widow .      come now , let we set thing right ,    say the   Lord : though your sin be like scarlet ,   they may become white as snow ; though they be red like crimson ,   they may become white as wool .    if you be willing , and obey ,   you shall eat the good thing of the land ;   but if you refuse and resist ,   you shall be eat by the sword :   for the mouth of the   Lord   have speak !    the Purification of Jerusalem   how she have become a prostitute ,   the faithful city ,    so upright ! justice use to lodge within she ,   but now , murderer .    your silver be turn to dross ,   your wine be mix with water .   your prince be rebel   and comrade of thief ; each one of they love a bribe   and look for gift . the fatherless they do not defend ,   the widow plea do not reach they .    now , therefore , say the Lord ,   the   Lord   of host , the Mighty One of Israel : ah ! I will take vengeance on my foe   and fully repay my enemy !    I will turn my hand against you ,   and refine your dross in the furnace ,   remove all your alloy .   I will restore your judge    as at first ,   and your counselor as in the beginning ; after that you shall be call   city of justice , faithful city .     Zion shall be redeem by justice ,   and her repentant one by righteousness .   Rebels and sinner together shall be crush ,   those who desert the   Lord   shall be consume .    judgment on the Sacred Groves    you shall be ashamed of the terebinth which you desire ,   and blush on account of the garden which you choose .   you shall become like a terebinth whose leave wither ,   like a garden that have no water .   the strong tree shall turn to tinder ,   and the one who tend it shall become a spark ; both of they shall burn together ,   and there shall be none to quench they .
