b '     at that time the   Lord   say to I , cut two stone tablet like the first one    and come up the mountain to I . also make an ark out of wood .      I will write upon the tablet the word that be on the tablet that you break , and you shall place they in the ark .      so I make an ark of acacia wood , and cut two stone tablet like the first one , and go up the mountain with the two tablet in my hand .         the   Lord   then write on the tablet , as he have write before , the ten word    that the   Lord   have speak to you on the mountain from the midst of the fire on the day of the assembly ; and the   Lord   give they to I .      then I turn and come down from the mountain , and place the tablet in the ark I have make .    there they have remain , as the   Lord   command I .      the Israelites set out from Beeroth Bene - jaakan for Moserah ; Aaron die there and be bury . his son Eleazar succeed he as priest .        from there they set out for Gudgodah , and from Gudgodah for Jotbathah , a region where there be water in the wadie .      at that time the   Lord   set apart the tribe of Levi to carry the ark of the covenant of the   Lord ,    to stand before the   Lord   to minister to he , and to bless in his name , as they have do to this day .      for this reason , Levi have no hereditary portion with his relative ;    the   Lord   himself be his portion , as the   Lord , your God , promise he .     meanwhile I stay on the mountain as I do before , forty day and forty night , and once again the   Lord   listen to I . the   Lord   be unwilling to destroy you .      the   Lord   say to I , go now and set out at the head of the people ,    that they may enter in and possess the land that I swear to their ancestor I would give they .    the Lords Majesty and Compassion .      now , therefore , Israel , what do the   Lord , your God , ask of you but to fear the   Lord , your God , to follow in all his way , to love and serve the   Lord , your God , with your whole heart and with your whole being ,        to keep the commandment and statute of the   Lord   that I be command you today for your own well - being ?        look , the heaven , even the high heaven , belong to the   Lord , your God , as well as the earth and everything on it .        yet only on your ancestor do the   Lord   set his heart to love they . he choose you , their descendant , from all the people , as it be today .        Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart ,    and be stiff - necked no long .      for the   Lord , your God , be the God of god , the Lord of lord , the great God , mighty and awesome , who have no favorite , accept no bribe ,        who execute justice for the orphan and the widow , and love the resident alien , give they food and clothing .        so you too should love the resident alien , for that be what you be in the land of Egypt .        the   Lord , your God , shall you fear , and he shall you serve ; to he hold fast and by his name shall you swear .        he be your praise ; he be your God , who have do for you those great and awesome thing that your own eye have see .        Seventy strong your ancestor go down to Egypt ,    and now the   Lord , your God , have make you as numerous as the star of heaven .             '
