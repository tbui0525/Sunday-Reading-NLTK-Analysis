b '   inasmuch as many and great truth have be give to we through the Law , the prophet , and the author who follow they ,    for which the instruction and wisdom of Israel merit praise , it be the duty of those who read the scripture not only to become knowledgeable themselves but also to use their love of learn in speech and in writing to help other less familiar . so my grandfather Jesus , who have long devote himself to the study of the law , the prophet , and the rest of the book of our ancestor , and have acquire great familiarity with they , be move to write something himself regard instruction and wisdom . he do this so that those who love learn might , by accept what he have write , make even great progress in live accord to the Law . you be invite therefore to read it with good will and attention , with indulgence for any failure on our part , despite earnest effort , in the interpretation of particular passage . for word speak originally in Hebrew do not have the same effect when they be translate into another language . that be true not only of this book but of the Law itself , the prophecy , and the rest of the book , which differ no little when they be read in the original . I arrive in Egypt in the thirty - eighth year of the reign of King Euergetes , and while there , I have access to no little learning . I therefore consider it my duty to devote some diligence and industry to the translation of this book . during this time I apply my skill for many sleepless hour to complete the book and publish it for those live abroad who wish to acquire learning and be dispose to live their life accord to the Law .   chapter 1 Gods Gift of Wisdom    all wisdom    be from the Lord   and remain with he forever .    the sand of the sea , the drop of rain ,   the day of eternity\xe2\x80\x94who can count they ?   Heavens height , earth extent ,   the abyss and wisdom\xe2\x80\x94who can explore they ?   before all other thing wisdom be create ;   and prudent understanding , from eternity .      the root of wisdom\xe2\x80\x94to whom have it be reveal ?   her subtleties\xe2\x80\x94who know they ?      there be but one , wise and truly awesome ,   seat upon his throne\xe2\x80\x94the Lord .   it be he who create she ,   see she and measure she ,   pour she forth upon all his work ,    upon every living thing accord to his bounty ,   lavish she upon those who love he .    fear of the Lord be Wisdom    the fear of the Lord    be glory and exultation ,   gladness and a festive crown .   the fear of the Lord rejoice the heart ,   give gladness , joy , and long life .    those who fear the Lord will be happy at the end ,   even on the day of death they will be bless .     the beginning of wisdom be to fear the Lord ;   she be create with the faithful in the womb .    with the godly she be create from of old ,   and with their descendant she will keep faith .     the fullness of wisdom be to fear the Lord ;   she inebriate they with her fruit .    their entire house she fill with choice food ,   their granary with her produce .     the crown of wisdom be the fear of the Lord ,   flower with peace and perfect health .    Knowledge and full understanding she rain down ;   she heighten the glory of those who possess she .     the root of wisdom be to fear the Lord ;   her branch be long life .   the fear of the Lord drive away sin ;   where it abide it turn back all anger .     unjust anger can never be justify ;   anger pull a person to utter ruin .    until the right time , the patient remain calm ,   then cheerfulness come back to they .   until the right time they hold back their word ;   then the lip of many will tell of their good sense .     among wisdom treasure be the model for knowledge ;   but godliness be an abomination to the sinner .   if you desire wisdom , keep the commandment ,   and the Lord will bestow she upon you ;   for the fear of the Lord be wisdom and discipline ;   faithfulness and humility be his delight .     do not disobey the fear of the Lord ,    do not approach it with duplicity of heart .    do not be a hypocrite before other ;   over your lip keep watch .   do not exalt yourself lest you fall   and bring dishonor upon yourself ;    for then the Lord will reveal your secret   and cast you down in the midst of the assembly . because you do not approach the fear of the Lord ,   and your heart be full of deceit .
