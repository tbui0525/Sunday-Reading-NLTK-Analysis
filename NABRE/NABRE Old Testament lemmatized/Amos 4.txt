b '   Second summon   hear this word , you cow of Bashan ,    who live on the mount of Samaria : who oppress the destitute   and abuse the needy ; who say to your husband ,   bring we a drink !   the Lord   God   have swear by his holiness : truly day be come upon you   when they shall drag you away with rope ,   your child with fishhook ;   you shall go out through the breach wall   one in front of the other , and you shall be exile to Harmon\xe2\x80\x94    oracle of the   Lord .     come to Bethel    and sin ,   to Gilgal and sin all the more ! each morning bring your sacrifice ,   every third day your tithe ;   Burn leaven bread as a thanksgiving sacrifice ,   proclaim publicly your voluntary offering , for so you love to do , Israelites\xe2\x80\x94   oracle of the Lord   God .     though I make your tooth   clean of food in all your city ,   and make bread scarce in all your dwelling , yet you do not return to me\xe2\x80\x94   oracle of the   Lord .     and I withhold the rain from you   when the harvest be still three month away ; I send rain upon one city   but not upon another ; one field be water by rain ,   but the one I do not water dry up ;   two or three city stagger to another to drink water   but be not satisfied ; yet you do not return to me\xe2\x80\x94   oracle of the   Lord .   I strike you with blight and mildew ;   locust devour your garden and vineyard ,   the caterpillar consume your fig tree and olive tree ; yet you do not return to me\xe2\x80\x94   oracle of the   Lord .    I send upon you pestilence like that of Egypt ;    with the sword I kill your young man and your capture horse ,   and to your nostril I bring the stench of your camp ; yet you do not return to me\xe2\x80\x94   oracle of the   Lord .   I overthrow you   as when God overthrow Sodom and Gomorrah ;   you be like a brand pluck from the fire ,   yet you do not return to me\xe2\x80\x94   oracle of the   Lord .   therefore thus I will do to you ,    Israel :   and since I will deal thus with you ,   prepare to meet your God , o Israel !   the one who form mountain and create wind ,   and declare to mortal their thought ; who make dawn into darkness   and stride upon the height of the earth ,   the   Lord , the God of host , be his name !
