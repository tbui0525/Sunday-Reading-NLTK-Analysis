b '   sanctity of the Priesthood .      the   Lord   say to Moses : speak to the priest , Aarons son , and tell they : none of you shall make himself unclean for any dead person among his kindred ,        except for his near relative , his mother or father , his son or daughter , his brother        or his unmarried sister , who be of his own family while she remain single ; for these he may make himself unclean .      but as a husband among his kindred    he shall not make himself unclean and thus profane himself .     the priest shall not make bald the crown of their head , nor shave the edge of their beard , nor lacerate their body .        they shall be holy to their God , and shall not profane their Gods name , since they offer the oblation of the   Lord , the food of their God ; so they must be holy .      a priest shall not marry a woman debase by prostitution , nor a woman who have be divorce by her husband ; for the priest be holy to his God .        honor he as holy for he offer the food    of your God ; he shall be holy to you , because I , the   Lord , be holy who make you holy .     if a priest daughter debase herself by prostitution , she thereby debase her father ; she shall be burn with fire .      the most exalted of the priest , upon whose head the anoint oil have be pour and who have be ordain to wear the special vestment , shall not dishevel his hair or rend his garment ,      nor shall he go near any dead person .    not even for his father or mother may he thus become unclean ;      nor shall he leave the sanctuary and profane the sanctuary of his God , for the consecration of the anoint oil of his God be upon he .    I be the   Lord .     he shall marry only a woman who be a virgin .      he shall not marry a widow or a woman who have be divorce or one who have be debase by prostitution , but only a virgin , take from his kindred , he shall marry ,        so that he not profane his offspring among his kindred . I , the   Lord , make he holy . priestly Blemishes .        the   Lord   say to Moses :      say to Aaron : none of your descendant , throughout their generation , who have any blemish shall come forward to offer the food of his God .      anyone who have any of the follow blemish may not come forward :    he who be blind , or lame , or who have a split lip , or a limb too long ,      or a broken leg or arm ,      or who be a hunchback or dwarf or have a growth in the eye , or who be afflict with sore , scab , or crush testicle .      no descendant of Aaron the priest who have any such blemish may draw near to offer the oblation of the   Lord ; on account of his blemish he may not draw near to offer the food of his God .      he may , however , eat the food of his God : of the most sacred as well as sacred offering .        only , he may not enter through the veil nor draw near to the altar on account of his blemish ; he shall not profane my sacred precinct , for it be I , the   Lord , who make they holy .     Moses , therefore , tell this to Aaron and his son and to all the Israelites .             '
