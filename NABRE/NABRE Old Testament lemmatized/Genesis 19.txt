b '   destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah .      the two angel reach Sodom in the evening , as Lot be sit at the gate of Sodom . when Lot see they , he get up to greet they ; and bow down with his face to the ground ,      he say , please , my lord ,    come aside into your servant house for the night , and bathe your foot ; you can get up early to continue your journey . but they reply , no , we will pass the night in the town square .        he urge they so strongly , however , that they turn aside to his place and enter his house . he prepare a banquet for they , bake unleavened bread , and they dine .      before they go to bed , the townsman of Sodom , both young and old\xe2\x80\x94all the people to the last man\xe2\x80\x94surrounded the house .      they call to Lot and say to he , where be the man who come to your house tonight ? bring they out to we that we may have sexual relation with they .      Lot go out to meet they at the entrance . when he have shut the door behind he ,      he say , I beg you , my brother , do not do this wicked thing !      I have two daughter who have never have sexual relation with man . let I bring they out to you ,    and you may do to they as you please . but do not do anything to these man , for they have come under the shelter of my roof .      they reply , stand back ! this man , they say , come here as a resident alien , and now he dare to give order ! we will treat you bad than they ! with that , they press hard against Lot , move in close to break down the door .        but his guest put out their hand , pull Lot inside with they , and close the door ;      they strike the man at the entrance of the house , small and great , with such a blinding light    that they be utterly unable to find the doorway .     then the guest say to Lot : who else belong to you here ? son - in - law , your son , your daughter , all who belong to you in the city\xe2\x80\x94take they away from this place !        we be about to destroy this place , for the outcry reach the   Lord   against those here be so great that the   Lord   have send we to destroy it .        so Lot go out and speak to his son - in - law , who have contract marriage with his daughter .    come on , leave this place , he tell they ; the   Lord   be about to destroy the city . but his son - in - law think he be joke .     as dawn be break , the angel urge Lot on , say , come on ! take your wife with you and your two daughter who be here , or you will be sweep away in the punishment of the city .      when he hesitate , the man , because of the   Lord s compassion for he , seize his hand and the hand of his wife and his two daughter and lead they to safety outside the city .      as soon as they have bring they outside , they say : Flee for your life ! do not look back or stop anywhere on the Plain . Flee to the hill at once , or you will be sweep away .        oh , no , my lord ! Lot reply to they .      you have already show favor to your servant , do I the great kindness of save my life . but I can not flee to the hill , or the disaster will overtake and kill I .      look , this town ahead be near enough to escape to . it be only a small place .    let I flee there\xe2\x80\x94is it not a small place?\xe2\x80\x94to save my life .      well , then , he reply , I grant you this favor too . I will not overthrow the town you have mention .      hurry , escape there ! I can not do anything until you arrive there . that be why the town be call Zoar .      the sun have rise over the earth when Lot arrive in Zoar ,      and the   Lord   rain down sulfur upon Sodom and Gomorrah , fire from the   Lord   out of heaven .        he overthrow    those city and the whole Plain , together with the inhabitant of the city and the produce of the soil .        but lot wife look back , and she be turn into a pillar of salt .      the next morning Abraham hurry to the place where he have stand before the   Lord .      as he look down toward Sodom and Gomorrah and the whole region of the Plain ,    he see smoke over the land rise like the smoke from a kiln .      when God destroy the city of the Plain , he remember Abraham and send Lot away from the upheaval that occur when God overthrow the city where Lot have be live . Moabites and Ammonites .        since Lot be afraid to stay in Zoar , he and his two daughter go up from Zoar and settle in the hill country , where he live with his two daughter in a cave .      the firstborn say to the young : our father be get old , and there be not a man in the land to have intercourse with we as be the custom everywhere .      come , let we ply our father with wine and then lie with he , that we may ensure posterity by our father .      so that night they ply their father with wine , and the firstborn go in and lie with her father ; but he be not aware of she lie down or get up .      the next day the firstborn say to the young : last night I lie with my father . let we ply he with wine again tonight , and then you go in and lie with he , that we may ensure posterity by our father .      so that night , too , they ply their father with wine , and then the young one go in and lie with he ; but he be not aware of she lie down or get up .     thus the two daughter of Lot become pregnant by their father .      the firstborn give birth to a son whom she name Moab , say , from my father .    he be the ancestor of the Moabites of today .        the young one , too , give birth to a son , and she name he Ammon , say , the son of my kin .    he be the ancestor of the Ammonites of today .
