b '   responsibility to Parents    Children , listen to I , your father ;   act accordingly , that you may be safe .   for the Lord set a father in honor over his child   and confirm a mother authority over her son .   those who honor their father atone for sin ;    they store up rich who respect their mother .   those who honor their father will have joy in their own child ,   and when they pray they be hear .   those who respect their father will live a long life ;   those who obey the Lord honor their mother .     those who fear the Lord honor their father ,   and serve their parent as master .   in word and deed honor your father ,   that all blessing may come to you .    a father blessing give a person firm root ,   but a mother curse uproot the grow plant .    do not glory in your father disgrace ,   for that be no glory to you !   a father glory be glory also for oneself ;   they multiply sin who demean their mother .      my son , be steadfast in honor your father ;   do not grieve he as long as he live .    even if his mind fail , be considerate of he ;   do not revile he because you be in your prime .   kindness to a father will not be forget ;   it will serve as a sin offering\xe2\x80\x94it will take last root .   in time of trouble it will be recall to your advantage ,   like warmth upon frost it will melt away your sin .   those who neglect their father be like blasphemer ;   those who provoke their mother be accurse by their creator .     Humility    my son , conduct your affair with humility ,   and you will be love more than a giver of gift .   humble yourself the more , the great you be ,   and you will find mercy in the sight of God .     for great be the power of the Lord ;   by the humble he be glorify .   what be too sublime for you , do not seek ;   do not reach into thing that be hide from you .    what be committed to you , pay heed to ;   what be hide be not your concern .   in matter that be beyond you do not meddle ,   when you have be show more than you can understand .   indeed , many be the conceit of human being ;   evil imagination lead they astray .    Docility    without the pupil of the eye , light be missing ;   without knowledge , wisdom be miss .   a stubborn heart will fare badly in the end ;   those who love danger will perish in it .   a stubborn heart will have many a hurt ;   add sin to sin be madness .   when the proud be afflict , there be no cure ;   for they be offshoot of an evil plant .    the mind of the wise appreciate proverb ,   and the ear that listen to wisdom rejoice .    alm for the Poor   as water quench a flame fire ,   so almsgiving atone for sin .    the kindness people have do cross their path later on ;   should they stumble , they will find support .
