b '   Trust in the Lord and not in Dreams    empty and false be the hope of the senseless ,   and dream give wing to fool .   like one grasp at shadow or chase the wind ,   so anyone who believe in dream .   what be see in dream be a reflection ,   the likeness of a face look at itself .   how can the unclean produce what be clean ?   how can the false produce what be true ?    Divination , omen , and dream be unreal ;   what you already expect , the mind fantasize .   unless they be specially send by the most high ,   do not fix your heart on they .   for dream have lead many astray ,   and those who put their hope in they have perish .   without such deception the Law will be fulfil ,   and in the mouth of the faithful be complete wisdom .     a much - travel person know many thing ;   and one with much experience speak sense .   an inexperienced person know little ,    whereas with travel one add to resourcefulness .   I have see much in my travel ,   and learn more than I could ever say .   often I be in danger of death ,   but by these experience I be save .     living be the spirit of those who fear the Lord ,    for their hope be in their savior .   whoever fear the Lord be afraid of nothing   and be never discourage , for he be their hope .    happy the soul that fear the Lord !    in whom do he trust , and who be his support ?   the eye of the Lord be upon those who love he ;   he be their mighty shield and strong support , a shelter from the heat , a shade from the noonday sun ,   a guard against stumble , a help against fall .    he lift up spirit , bring a sparkle to the eye ,   give health and life and blessing .    true worship of God    Ill - get good offer in sacrifice be taint .    present from the lawless do not win god favor .    the most High be not pleased with the gift of the godless ,   nor for their many sacrifice do he forgive their sin .   one who slay a son in his father presence\xe2\x80\x94   whoever offer sacrifice from the holding of the poor .   the bread of charity be life itself for the needy ;    whoever withhold it be a murderer .   to take away a neighbor live be to commit murder ;    to deny a laborer wage be to shed blood .     if one build up and another tear down ,   what do they gain but trouble ?   if one pray and another curse ,   whose voice will God hear ?   if one again touch a corpse after bathe ,   what do he gain by the purification ?    so one who fast for sin ,   but go and commit they again : who will hear his prayer ,   what be gain by mortification ?
