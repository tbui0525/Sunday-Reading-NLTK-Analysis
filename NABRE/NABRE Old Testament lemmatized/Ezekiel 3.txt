b '    he say to I : Son of man , eat what you find here : eat this scroll , then go , speak to the house of Israel .      so I open my mouth , and he give I the scroll to eat .       Son of man , he say to I , feed your stomach and fill your belly with this scroll I be give you . I eat it , and it be as sweet as honey    in my mouth .      then he say to I , Son of man , go now to the house of Israel , and speak my word to they .     not to a people with obscure speech and difficult language be I send you , but to the house of Israel .        nor to many nation of obscure speech and difficult language whose word you can not understand . for if I be to send you to these , they would listen to you .        but the house of Israel will refuse to listen to you , since they refuse to listen to I . for the whole house of Israel be stubborn of brow and hard of heart .         look ! I make your face as hard as theirs , and your brow as stubborn as theirs .        like diamond , hard than flint , I make your brow . do not be afraid of they , or be terrify by their look , for they be a rebellious house .      then he say to I , Son of man , take into your heart all my word that I speak to you ; hear they well .      now go to the exile , to your own people , and speak to they . say to they , whether they hear or refuse to hear : thus say the   Lord   God !     then the spirit lift I up , and I hear behind I a loud rumble noise as the glory of the   Lord    rise from its place :        the noise of the wing of the living creature beat against one another , and the noise of the wheel alongside they , a loud rumble .        and the spirit lift I up and take I away , and I go off , my spirit angry and bitter , for the hand of the   Lord   press hard on I .      thus I come to the exile who live at Tel - abib    by the river Chebar ; and there where they dwelt , I stay among they distraught for seven day .       at the end of the seven day , the word of the   Lord   come to I : the Prophet as Sentinel .        Son of man , I have appoint you a sentinel for the house of Israel .    when you hear a word from my mouth , you shall warn they for I .     if I say to the wicked , you shall surely die\xe2\x80\x94and you do not warn they or speak out to dissuade the wicked from their evil conduct in order to save their lives\xe2\x80\x94then they shall die for their sin , but I will hold you responsible for their blood .      if , however , you warn the wicked and they still do not turn from their wickedness and evil conduct , they shall die for their sin , but you shall save your life .     but if the just turn away from their right conduct and do evil when I place a stumble block before they , then they shall die . even if you warn they about their sin , they shall still die , and the just deed that they perform will not be remember on their behalf . I will , however , hold you responsible for their blood .        if , on the other hand , you warn the just to avoid sin , and they do not sin , they will surely live because of the warning , and you in turn shall save your own life .    Ezekiel Mute .     the hand of the   Lord   come upon I there and he say to I : get up and go out into the plain , where I will speak with you .         so I get up and go out into the plain . there it be ! the glory of the   Lord   be stand there like the glory I have see by the river Chebar . then I fall on my face ,      but the spirit enter into I , set I on my foot ; he speak to I , and say : go , shut yourself in your house .      as for you , son of man , know that they will put rope on you and bind you with they , so that you can not go out among they .        and I will make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth so that you will be mute ,    no long one who rebuke they for be a rebellious house .        only when I speak to you and open your mouth , shall you say to they : thus say the   Lord   God : let those who hear , hear ! let those who resist , resist ! they be truly a rebellious house .
