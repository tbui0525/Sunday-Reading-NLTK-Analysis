b '     when King Hezekiah hear this , he tear his garment , cover himself with sackcloth , and go into the house of the   Lord .      he send Eliakim , the master of the palace , and Shebna the scribe , and the elder of the priest , cover with sackcloth , to tell the prophet Isaiah , son of Amoz ,     thus say Hezekiah : a day of distress and rebuke ,   a day of disgrace be this day ! child be due to come forth ,   but the strength to give birth be lack .       perhaps the   Lord , your God , will hear the word of the commander , whom his lord , the king of Assyria , send to taunt the live God , and will rebuke he for the word which the   Lord , your God , have hear . so lift up a prayer for the remnant that be here .     when the servant of King Hezekiah have come to Isaiah ,      he say to they : tell this to your lord : thus say the   Lord : do not be frighten by the word you have hear , by which the deputy of the king of Assyria have blaspheme I .      I be put in he such a spirit   that when he hear a report   he will return to his land .   I will make he fall by the sword in his land .     when the commander , on his return , hear that the king of Assyria have withdraw from Lachish , he find he besiege Libnah .      the king of Assyria hear a report : Tirhakah ,    king of Ethiopia , have come out to fight against you . again he send messenger to Hezekiah to say :      thus shall you say to Hezekiah , king of Judah : do not let your God in whom you trust deceive you by say , Jerusalem will not be hand over to the king of Assyria .        you , certainly , have hear what the king of Assyria have do to all the land : they put they under the ban ! and be you to be deliver ?      do the god of the nation whom my father destroy deliver them\xe2\x80\x94Gozan , Haran , rezeph , and the Edenites in Telassar ?      where be the king of Hamath , the king of Arpad , or a king of the city Sepharvaim , Hena or Ivvah ?     Hezekiah take the letter from the hand of the messenger and read it ; then he go up to the house of the   Lord , and spread it out before the   Lord ,      Hezekiah pray to the   Lord :      Lord   of host , God of Israel ,   enthrone on the cherubim ! you alone be God   over all the kingdom of the earth . it be you who make   the heaven and the earth .    incline your ear ,   Lord , and listen !   open your eye ,   Lord , and see ! hear all the word Sennacherib have send   to taunt the live God .   truly , o   Lord ,   the king of Assyria have lay waste   the nation and their land .   they give their god to the fire   \xe2\x80\x94they be not god at all ,   but the work of human hands\xe2\x80\x94 Wood and stone , they destroy they .    therefore ,   Lord , our God ,   save we from this mans power , that all the kingdom of the earth may know   that you alone ,   Lord , be God .      then Isaiah , son of Amoz , send this message to Hezekiah : thus say the   Lord , the God of Israel , to whom you have pray concern Sennacherib , king of Assyria : I have listen !      this be the word the   Lord   have speak concern he :   she despise you , laugh you to scorn ,   the virgin daughter Zion ; behind you she wag her head ,   daughter Jerusalem .   whom have you insult and blaspheme ,   at whom have you raise your voice and lift up your eye on high ?   at the Holy One of Israel !    through the mouth of your messenger   you have insult the Lord when you say : with my many chariot I go up   to the top of the peak ,   to the recess of Lebanon , to cut down its lofty cedar ,   its choice cypress ; I reach the farth shelter ,   the forest range .   I myself dig well   and drink foreign water ; dry up all the river of Egypt   beneath the sol of my foot .   have you not hear ?   a long time ago I prepare it ,   from day of old I plan it , now I have bring it about :   you be here to reduce   fortify city to heap of ruin ,    their people powerless ,   dismayed and distraught , they be plant of the field ,   green growth ,   thatch on the rooftop , Grain scorch by the east wind .   I know when you stand or sit ,   when you come or go ,   and how you rage against I .   because you rage against I   and your smugness have reach my ear , I will put my hook in your nose   and my bit in your mouth , and make you leave by the way you come .    this shall be a sign    for you : this year you shall eat the aftergrowth ,   next year , what grow of itself ; but in the third year , sow and reap ,   plant vineyard and eat their fruit !   the remain survivor of the house of Judah   shall again strike root below   and bear fruit above .    for out of Jerusalem shall come a remnant ,   and from Mount Zion , survivor . the zeal of the   Lord   of host shall do this .      therefore , thus say the   Lord   about the king of Assyria : he shall not come as far as this city ,   nor shoot there an arrow ,   nor confront it with a shield , nor cast up a siege - work against it .   by the way he come he shall leave ,   never come as far as this city ,   oracle of the   Lord .   I will shield and save this city   for my own sake and the sake of David my servant .      then the angel of the   Lord   go forth and strike down one hundred and eighty - five thousand in the assyrian camp . early the next morning , there they be , all those corpse , dead !         so Sennacherib , the king of Assyria , break camp , depart , return home , and stay in Nineveh .     when he be worship in the temple of his god Nisroch , his son Adrammelech and Sharezer strike he down with the sword and flee into the land of Ararat .    his son Esarhaddon reign in his place .
