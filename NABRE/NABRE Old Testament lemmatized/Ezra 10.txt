b '   response to the Crisis .     while Ezra pray and acknowledge their guilt , weeping and prostrate before the house of God , a very large assembly of Israelites gather about he , man , woman , and child ; and the people weep profusely .      then Shecaniah , the son of Jehiel , one of the descendant of Elam , make this appeal to Ezra : we have indeed betray our God by take as wife foreign woman of the people of the land . yet in spite of this there still remain a hope for Israel .      let we therefore enter into a covenant before our God to dismiss all our foreign wife and the child bear of they , in keep with what you , my lord , advise , and those who be in dread of the commandment of our God . let it be do accord to the law !      rise , then , for this be your duty ! we be with you , so have courage and act !     Ezra stand and demand an oath from the leader of the priest , from the Levites and from all Israel that they would do as have be propose ; and they swear it .      then Ezra leave his place before the house of God and enter the chamber of Johanan , son of Eliashib ,    where he spend the night neither eat food nor drinking water , for he be in mourn over the apostasy of the exile .      a proclamation be make throughout Judah and Jerusalem that all the exile should gather together in Jerusalem ,      and that whoever fail to appear within three day would , accord to the judgment of the leader and elder , suffer the confiscation of all his possession , and would be exclude from the assembly of the exile .     all the man of Judah and Benjamin gather together in Jerusalem within the three - day period : it be in the ninth month ,    on the twentieth day of the month . all the people , sit in the open place before the house of God , be tremble both over the matter at hand and because it be rain .       then Ezra , the priest , stand up and say to they : your apostasy in take foreign woman as wife have add to Israels guilt .      but now , give praise to the   Lord , the God of your ancestor , and do his will : separate yourself from the people of the land and from the foreign woman .      in answer , the whole assembly cry out with a loud voice : yes , it be our duty to do as you say !      but the people be numerous and it be the rainy season , so that we can not remain outside ; besides , this be not a task that can be perform in a single day or even two , for those of we who have sin in this regard be many .      let our leader represent the whole assembly ; then let all those in our city who have take foreign woman for wife appear at appoint time , accompany by the elder and magistrate of each city in question , till we have turn away from we our Gods burn anger over this affair .      only Jonathan , son of Asahel , and Jahzeiah , son of Tikvah , be against this proposal , with Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite support they .      the exile do as agree .
