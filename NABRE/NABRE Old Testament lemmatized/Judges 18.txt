b '   Migration of the Danites .     in those day there be no king in Israel .    in those day the tribe of the Danites be in search of a heritage to dwell in , for up to that time no heritage have be allot    to they among the tribe of Israel .      so the Danites send from their clan five powerful man of Zorah and Eshtaol , to reconnoiter the land and scout it . go , scout the land , they be tell . they go into the mountain region of Ephraim , and they spend the night there .      while they be near the house of Micah ,    they recognize the voice    of the young Levite ,    so they turn aside . they ask he , who bring you here ? what be you do here ? what be your interest here ?      this be what Micah have do for I , he reply to they . he have hire I and I have become his priest .        they say to he , consult God , that we may know whether the journey we be make will lead to success .        the priest say to they , go in peace ! the journey you be make be under the eye of the   Lord .     so the five man go on and come to Laish . they see the people there live securely after the manner of the Sidonians , quiet and trusting , with no lack of any natural resource . they be distant from the Sidonians and have no dealing with the Arameans .        when the five return to their kin in Zorah and Eshtaol , they be ask , what do you have to report ?      they reply , come , let we attack they , for we have see the land and it be very good . be you go to hesitate ? do not be slow to go in and take possession of the land !      when you go you will come to a trust people . the land stretch out in both direction , and God have indeed give it into your power\xe2\x80\x94a place where no natural resource be lack .      so six hundred of the clan of the Danites , man arm with weapon of war , set out from Zorah and Eshtaol .      they march up into Judah and encamp near Kiriath - jearim ; for this reason the place be call Mahaneh - dan    to this day ( it lie west of Kiriath - jearim ) .      from there they pass on into the mountain region of Ephraim and come to the house of Micah .      then the five man who have go to reconnoiter the land speak up and say to their kindred , do you know that in these house there be an ephod , teraphim , and an idol overlay with silver ?    now decide what you must do !      so turn in that direction , they go to the house of the young Levite at the home of Micah and greet he .      the six hundred danite station themselves at the entrance of the gate arm with weapon of war .      the five man who have go to reconnoiter the land go up      and enter the house of Micah with the priest stand there . they take the idol , the ephod , the teraphim and the metal image . when the priest say to they , what be you do ?      they say to he , be still ! put your hand over your mouth ! come with we and be our father and priest .    be it well for you to be priest for the family of one man or to be priest for a tribe and a clan in Israel ?      the priest , agree , take the ephod , the teraphim , and the idol , and go along with the troop .      as they turn to depart , they place their little one , their livestock , and their good at the head of the column .      when the Danites have go some distance from the house of Micah , Micah and the man in the house nearby muster and overtake they .      they call to the Danites , who turn and say to Micah , what do you want that you have call this muster ?      you have take my god , which I make for myself , and you have go off with my priest as well , he answer . what be leave for I ? how , then , can you ask I , what do you want ?      the Danites say to he , do not let your voice be hear near we , or aggravate man will attack you , and you will have forfeit your life and the life of your family !      then the Danites go on their way , and Micah , see that they be too strong for he , turn back and go home .      having take what Micah have make and his priest , they march against Laish , a quiet and trust people ; they put they to the sword and destroy the city by fire .      no one come to their aid , since the city be far from Sidon and they have no dealing with the Arameans ; the city be in the valley that belong to Beth - rehob . the Danites then rebuild the city and occupy it .      they name it Dan after their ancestor Dan , who be bear to Israel .    but Laish be the name of the city formerly .       the Danites set up the idol for themselves , and Jonathan , son of Gershom , son of Moses ,    and his descendant be priest for the tribe of the Danites until the time the land go into captivity .      they maintain the idol Micah have make as long as the house of God be in Shiloh .
