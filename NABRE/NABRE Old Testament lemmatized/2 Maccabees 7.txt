b '   Martyrdom of a Mother and her Seven Sons .     it also happen that seven brother with their mother be arrest and torture with whip and scourge by the king to force they to eat pork in violation of Gods law .        one of the brother , speak for the other , say : what do you expect to learn by question we ? we be ready to die rather than transgress the law of our ancestor .     at that the king , in a fury , give order to have pan and caldron heat .      these be quickly heat , and he give the order to cut out the tongue of the one who have speak for the other , to scalp he and cut off his hand and foot , while the rest of his brother and his mother look on .      when he be completely maimed but still breathe , the king order they to carry he to the fire and fry he . as a cloud of smoke spread from the pan , the brother and their mother encourage one another to die nobly , with these word :      the Lord God be look on and truly have compassion on we , as Moses declare in his song , when he openly bear witness , say , and God will have compassion on his servant .      after the first brother have die in this manner , they bring the second to be make sport of . after tear off the skin and hair of his head , they ask he , will you eat the pork rather than have your body torture limb by limb ?      answer in the language of his ancestor , he say , never ! so he in turn suffer the same torture as the first .      with his last breath he say : you accursed fiend , you be deprive we of this present life , but the King of the universe will raise we up    to live again forever , because we be die for his law .      after he the third suffer their cruel sport . he put forth his tongue at once when tell to do so , and bravely stretch out his hand ,      as he speak these noble word : it be from Heaven that I receive these ; for the sake of his law I disregard they ; from he I hope to receive they again .      even the king and his attendant marvel at the young mans spirit , because he regard his suffering as nothing .     after he have die , they torture and maltreat the fourth brother in the same way .      when he be near death , he say , it be my choice to die at the hand of mortal with the hope that God will restore I to life ; but for you , there will be no resurrection to life .     they next bring forward the fifth brother and maltreat he .      look at the king , he say :    mortal though you be , you have power over human being , so you do what you please . but do not think that our nation be forsake by God .      only wait , and you will see how his great power will torment you and your descendant .     after he they bring the sixth brother . when he be about to die , he say : have no vain illusion . we suffer these thing on our own account , because we have sin against our God ; that be why such shocking thing have happen .      do not think , then , that you will go unpunished for having dare to fight against God .     most admirable and worthy of everlasting remembrance be the mother who , see her seven son perish in a single day , bear it courageously because of her hope in the Lord .      fill with a noble spirit that stir her womanly reason with manly emotion , she exhort each of they in the language of their ancestor with these word :       I do not know how you come to be in my womb ; it be not I who give you breath and life , nor be it I who arrange the element you be make of .      therefore , since it be the Creator of the universe who shape the beginning of humankind and bring about the origin of everything , he , in his mercy , will give you back both breath and life , because you now disregard yourself for the sake of his law .     Antiochus , suspect insult in her word , think he be be ridicule . as the young brother be still alive , the king appeal to he , not with mere word , but with promise on oath , to make he rich and happy if he would abandon his ancestral custom : he would make he his friend and entrust he with high office .      when the youth pay no attention to he at all , the king appeal to the mother , urge she to advise her boy to save his life .      after he have urge she for a long time , she agree to persuade her son .      she lean over close to he and , in derision of the cruel tyrant , say in their native language : Son , have pity on I , who carry you in my womb for nine month , nurse you for three year , bring you up , educate and support you to your present age .      I beg you , child , to look at the heaven and the earth and see all that be in they ; then you will know that God do not make they out of exist thing .    in the same way humankind come into existence .      do not be afraid of this executioner , but be worthy of your brother and accept death , so that in the time of mercy I may receive you again with your brother .     she have scarcely finish speak when the youth say : what be the delay ? I will not obey the king command . I obey the command of the law give to our ancestor through Moses .      but you , who have contrive every kind of evil for the Hebrews , will not escape the hand of God .      we , indeed , be suffer because of our sin .        though for a little while our live Lord have be angry , correct and chastise we , he will again be reconcile with his servant .      but you , wretch , most vile of mortal , do not , in your insolence , buoy yourself up with unfounded hope , as you raise your hand against the child of heaven .      you have not yet escape the judgment of the almighty and all - see God .      our brother , after endure brief pain , have drunk of never - fail life , under Gods covenant . but you , by the judgment of God , shall receive just punishment for your arrogance .      like my brother , I offer up my body and my life for our ancestral law , implore God to show mercy soon to our nation , and by affliction and blow to make you confess that he alone be God .      through I and my brother , may there be an end to the wrath of the Almighty that have justly fall on our whole nation .     at that , the king become enraged and treat he even bad than the other , since he bitterly resent the boy contempt .      thus he too die undefiled , put all his trust in the Lord .      last of all , after her son , the mother be put to death .      enough have be say about the sacrificial meal and the excessive cruelty .
