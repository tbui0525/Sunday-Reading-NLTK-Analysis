b '   the Menorah .     the   Lord   say to Moses :      speak to Aaron and say : when you set up the menorah - lamp ,    have the seven lamp throw their light in front of the menorah .        Aaron do so , set up the menorah - lamp to face the area in front of the menorah , just as the   Lord   have command Moses .      this be the construction of the menorah : hammer gold ,    from its base to its bowl    it be hammer ; accord to the pattern which the   Lord   have show Moses , so he make the menorah .    Purification of the Levites .     the   Lord   say to Moses :      take the Levites from among the Israelites and cleanse they .        this be what you shall do to they to cleanse they . sprinkle they with the water of purification , have they shave their whole body and wash their garment , and so cleanse themselves .      then they shall take a bull from the herd , along with its grain offering of bran flour mix with oil ; and you shall take another bull from the herd for a purification offering .      bring the Levites before the tent of meeting , you shall assemble also the whole community of the Israelites .      when you have bring the Levites before the   Lord , the Israelites shall lay their hand upon they .      Aaron shall then present the Levites before the   Lord   as an elevated offering from the Israelites , that they may perform the service of the   Lord .      the Levites in turn shall lay their hand on the head of the bull , offer one as a purification offering and the other as a burn offering to the   Lord , to make atonement for the Levites .      then you shall have the Levites stand before Aaron and his son , and you shall present they as an elevated offering to the   Lord ;      thus you shall separate the Levites from the rest of the Israelites , and the Levites shall belong to I .      only then shall the Levites enter upon their service in the tent of meeting , when you have cleanse they and present they as an elevated offering .      for they , among the Israelites , be totally dedicated to I ; I have take they for myself in place of everyone that open the womb , the firstborn of all the Israelites .        indeed , all the firstborn among the Israelites , human being and beast alike , belong to I ; I consecrate they to myself on the day I kill all the firstborn in the land of Egypt .        but I have take the Levites in place of all the firstborn Israelites ;      and from among the Israelites I have give to Aaron and his son these Levites , who be to be dedicate ,    to perform the service of the Israelites in the tent of meeting and to make atonement for they , so that no plague may strike among the Israelites should they come too near the sanctuary .     this , then , be what Moses and Aaron and the whole community of the Israelites do with respect to the Levites ; the Israelites do exactly as the   Lord   have command Moses concern they .      when the Levites have purify themselves    and wash their garment , Aaron present they as an elevated offering before the   Lord , and make atonement for they to cleanse they .      only then do they enter upon their service in the tent of meeting under the supervision of Aaron and his son . exactly as the   Lord   have command Moses concern the Levites , so it be do with regard to they .    Age Limits for Levitical Service .     the   Lord   say to Moses :      this be the rule for the Levites . everyone twenty - five year old or more shall join the personnel in the service of the tent of meeting .        but everyone fifty on up shall retire from the work force and serve no more .      they shall assist their fellow levite in the tent of meeting in perform their duty , but they shall not do the work . this , then , be how you be to regulate the duty of the Levites .
