Simeon and Levi , brother indeed ,   weapon of violence be their knife .    let not my person enter their council ,   or my honor be join with their company ; for in their fury they kill man ,   at their whim they maim oxen .    curse be their fury so fierce ,   and their rage so cruel ! I will scatter they in Jacob ,   disperse they throughout Israel .     you , Judah , shall your brother praise   \xe2\x80\x94your hand on the neck of your enemy ;   the son of your father shall bow down to you .   Judah be a lion cub ,   you have grow up on prey , my son . he crouch , lie down like a lion ,   like a lioness\xe2\x80\x94who would dare rouse he ?    the scepter shall never depart from Judah ,   or the mace from between his foot , until tribute come to he ,    and he receive the people obedience .   he tether his donkey to the vine ,   his donkey foal to the choice stem . in wine he wash his garment ,   his robe in the blood of grape .    his eye be dark than wine ,   and his tooth be white than milk .     Zebulun shall dwell by the seashore ;   he will be a haven for ship ,   and his flank shall rest on Sidon .     Issachar be a rawbone donkey ,   crouch between the saddlebag .   when he see how good a settle life be ,   and how pleasant the land , he bend his shoulder to the burden   and become a toil serf .     Dan shall achieve justice    for his people   as one of the tribe of Israel .   let Dan be a serpent by the roadside ,   a horned viper by the path , that bite the horse heel ,   so that the rider tumble backward .     I long for your deliverance , o   Lord !      Gad shall be raid by raider ,   but he shall raid at their heel .      Ashers produce be rich ,   and he shall furnish delicacy for king .     Naphtali be a hind let loose ,   which bring forth lovely fawn .     Joseph be a wild colt ,   a wild colt by a spring ,   wild colt on a hillside .   harry he and shoot ,   the archer oppose he ;   but his bow remain taut ,   and his arm be nimble , by the power of the Mighty One of Jacob ,   because of the Shepherd , the Rock of Israel ,   the God of your father , who help you ,    God Almighty , who bless you , with the blessing of the heavens above ,   the blessing of the abyss that crouch below , the blessing of breast and womb ,    the blessing of fresh grain and blossom ,   the blessing of the everlasting mountain ,   the delight of the eternal hill . may they rest on the head of Joseph ,   on the brow of the prince among his brother .     Benjamin be a ravenous wolf ;   morning he devour the prey ,   and evening he distribute the spoil .
