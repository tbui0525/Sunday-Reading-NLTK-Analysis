b '     the number of the Israelites   will be like the sand of the sea ,   which can be neither measure nor count .   instead of be tell ,   you be not - my - People , they will be call ,   child of the live God .    then the people of Judah and of Israel   will gather together ; they will appoint for themselves one head   and rise up from the land ;   great indeed shall be the day of Jezreel !   say to your brother , my People ,   and to your sister , Pitied .    the Lord and Israel his spouse    accuse your mother , accuse !   for she be not my wife ,   and I be not her husband .   let she remove her prostitution from her face .   her adultery from between her breast ,     or I will strip she naked ,    leave she as on the day of her birth ; I will make she like the wilderness ,   make she like an arid land ,   and let she die of thirst .   I will have no pity on her child ,   for they be child of prostitution .   yes , their mother have prostitute herself ;   she who conceive they have act shamefully . for she say , I will go after my lover ,    who give I my bread and my water ,   my wool and my flax , my oil and my drink .     therefore , I will hedge in her way with thorn   and erect a wall against she ,   so that she can not find her path .   if she run after her lover , she will not overtake they ;   if she seek they she will not find they . then she will say ,   I will go back to my first husband ,   for I be well off then than now .      she do not know   that it be I who give she   the grain , the wine , and the oil , I who lavish upon her silver ,   and gold , which they use for Baal ,    therefore I will take back my grain in its time ,   and my wine in its season ; I will snatch away my wool and my flax ,   which be to cover her nakedness .   now I will lay bare her shame   in full view of her lover ,    and no one can deliver she out of my hand .    I will put an end to all her joy ,   her festival , her new moon , her sabbaths\xe2\x80\x94   all her seasonal feast .   I will lay waste her vine and fig tree ,   of which she say , these be the fee   my lover have give I ; I will turn they into rank growth   and wild animal shall devour they .   I will punish she for the day of the Baals ,    for whom she burn incense , when she deck herself out with her ring and her jewelry ,   and go after her lovers\xe2\x80\x94   but I she forgot\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord .    therefore ,    I will allure she now ;   I will lead she into the wilderness    and speak persuasively to she .   then I will give she the vineyard she have ,   and the valley of Achor    as a door of hope .   there she will respond as in the day of her youth ,   as on the day when she come up from the land of Egypt .     on that day\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord \xe2\x80\x94 you shall call I my husband ,   and you shall never again call I my baal .    I will remove from her mouth the name of the Baals ;   they shall no long be mention by their name .     I will make a covenant for they on that day ,    with the wild animal , with the bird of the air ,   and with the thing that crawl on the ground . bow and sword and warfare   I will destroy from the land ,   and I will give they rest in safety .     I will betroth you to I forever :   I will betroth you to I with    justice and with judgment ,   with loyalty and with compassion ;   I will betroth you to I with fidelity ,   and you shall know the   Lord .   on that day I will respond\xe2\x80\x94oracle of the   Lord \xe2\x80\x94   I will respond to the heavens ,   and they will respond to the earth ;   the earth will respond to the grain , and wine , and oil ,   and these will respond to Jezreel .   I will sow she for myself in the land ,   and I will have pity on not - pitied . I will say to not - my - People , you be my people ,    and he will say , my God !             '
