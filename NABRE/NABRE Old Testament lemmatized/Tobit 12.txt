Tobit answer , it be only fair , son , that he should receive half of all that he bring back .      so Tobiah call Raphael and say , take as your wage half of all that you have bring back , and farewell ! exhortation .        Raphael call the two of they aside privately and say to they : bless God and give he thank before all the living for the good thing he have do for you , by blessing and extoll his name in song . Proclaim before all with due honor the deed of God , and do not be slack in thank he .        a king secret should be keep secret , but one must declare the work of God and give thank with due honor . do good , and evil will not overtake you .      prayer with fasting be good . almsgive with righteousness be well than wealth with wickedness . it be well to give alm than to store up gold ,        for almsgive save from death , and purge all sin . those who give alm will enjoy a full life ,        but those who commit sin and do evil be their own bad enemy .
