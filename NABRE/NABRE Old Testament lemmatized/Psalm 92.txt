b ' a Hymn of Thanksgiving for Gods Fidelity   a psalm . a sabbath song .    I   it be good to give thank to the   Lord ,   to sing praise to your name , most high ,    to proclaim your love at daybreak ,   your faithfulness in the night ,   with the ten - stringed harp ,   with melody upon the lyre .    for you make I jubilant ,   Lord , by your deed ;   at the work of your hand I shout for joy .    II   how great be your work ,   Lord !    how profound your design !   a senseless person can not know this ;   a fool can not comprehend .   though the wicked flourish like grass    and all sinner thrive , they be destine for eternal destruction ;    but you ,   Lord , be forever on high .   indeed your enemy ,   Lord ,   indeed your enemy shall perish ;   all sinner shall be scatter .     III   you have give I the strength of a wild ox ;    you have pour rich oil upon I .    my eye look with glee on my wicked enemy ;   my ear shall hear what happen to my wicked foe .    the just shall flourish like the palm tree ,   shall grow like a cedar of Lebanon .     plant in the house of the   Lord ,   they shall flourish in the court of our God .   they shall bear fruit even in old age ,   they will stay fresh and green ,   to proclaim : the   Lord   be just ;   my rock , in whom there be no wrong .
