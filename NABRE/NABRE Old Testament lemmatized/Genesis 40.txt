b '   the Dreams interpret .      some time afterward , the royal cupbearer and baker offend their lord , the king of Egypt .      Pharaoh be angry with his two official , the chief cupbearer and the chief baker ,      and he put they in custody in the house of the chief steward , the same jail where Joseph be confine .      the chief steward assign Joseph to they , and he become their attendant . after they have be in custody for some time ,      the cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt who be confine in the jail both have dream on the same night , each his own dream and each dream with its own meaning .      when Joseph come to they in the morning , he see that they look disturbed .      so he ask Pharaohs official who be with he in custody in his master house , why do you look so troubled today ?      they answer he , we have have dream , but there be no one to interpret they . Joseph say to they , do interpretation not come from God ? please tell I the dream .      then the chief cupbearer tell Joseph his dream . in my dream , he say , I see a vine in front of I ,      and on the vine be three branch . it have barely bud when its blossom come out , and its cluster ripen into grape .      Pharaohs cup be in my hand ; so I take the grape , press they out into his cup , and put it in Pharaohs hand .      Joseph say to he : this be its interpretation . the three branch be three day ;      within three day Pharaoh will single you out    and restore you to your post . you will be hand Pharaoh his cup as you formerly do when you be his cupbearer .      only think of I when all be well with you , and please do I the great favor of mention I to Pharaoh , to get I out of this place .      the truth be that I be kidnap from the land of the Hebrews , and I have not do anything here that they should have put I into a dungeon .     when the chief baker see that Joseph have give a favorable interpretation , he say to he : I too have a dream . in it I have three bread basket on my head ;      in the top one be all kind of bakery product for Pharaoh , but the bird be eat they out of the basket on my head .      Joseph say to he in reply : this be its interpretation . the three basket be three day ;      within three day Pharaoh will single you out and will impale you on a stake , and the bird will be eat your flesh .     and so on the third day , which be Pharaohs birthday , when he give a banquet to all his servant , he single out the chief cupbearer and chief baker in the midst of his servant .      he restore the chief cupbearer to his office , so that he again hand the cup to Pharaoh ;      but the chief baker he impaled\xe2\x80\x94just as Joseph have tell they in his interpretation .      yet the chief cupbearer do not think of Joseph ; he forget he .
