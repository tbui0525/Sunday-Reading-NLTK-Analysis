b '   confidence in God lead to Prosperity    my son , do not forget    my teaching ,   take to heart my command ;   for many day , and year of life ,    and peace , will they bring you .   do not let love and fidelity forsake you ;   bind they around your neck ;   write they on the tablet of your heart .   then will you win favor and esteem   before God and human being .   Trust in the   Lord   with all your heart ,   on your own intelligence do not rely ;   in all your way be mindful of he ,   and he will make straight your path .   do not be wise in your own eye ,    fear the   Lord   and turn away from evil ;   this will mean health for your flesh   and vigor for your bone .   honor the   Lord   with your wealth ,   with first fruit of all your produce ;    then will your barn be fill with plenty ,   with new wine your vat will overflow .   the discipline of the   Lord , my son , do not spurn ;    do not disdain his reproof ;    for whom the   Lord   love he reprove ,   as a father , the son he favor .     the benefit of find Wisdom    Happy the one who find wisdom ,   the one who gain understanding !    her profit be well than profit in silver ,   and well than gold be her revenue ;   she be more precious than coral ,   and no treasure of your can compare with she .    long life be in her right hand ,   in her leave be rich and honor ;   her way be pleasant way ,   and all her path be peace ;   she be a tree of life    to those who grasp she ,   and those who hold she fast be happy .    the   Lord   by wisdom found the earth ,   establish the heaven by understanding ;   by his knowledge the depth    be split ,   and the cloud drop down dew .    Justice toward Ones Neighbor Brings Blessing    my son , do not let these slip from your sight :   hold to deliberation and planning ;   so will they be life to your soul ,    and an adornment for your neck .   then you may go your way securely ;   your foot will never stumble ;   when you lie down , you will not be afraid ,   when you rest , your sleep will be sweet .   do not be afraid of sudden terror ,   of the ruin of the wicked when it come ;   for the   Lord   will be your confidence ,   and will keep your foot from the snare .   do not withhold any good from the owner   when it be in your power to act .   say not to your neighbor , go , come back tomorrow ,   and I will give it to you , when all the while you have it .   do not plot evil against your neighbor ,   when they live at peace with you .   do not contend with someone without cause ,   with one who have do you no harm .   do not envy the violent   and choose none of their way :    to the   Lord   the devious be an abomination ,   but the upright be close to he .   the curse of the   Lord   be on the house of the wicked ,   but the dwelling of the just he bless ;   those who scoff , he scoff at ,    but the lowly he favor .   the wise will possess glory ,   but fool will bear shame .
