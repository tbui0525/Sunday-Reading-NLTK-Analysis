I have become a portent to many ,   but you be my strong refuge !   my mouth shall be fill with your praise ,   shall sing your glory every day .    II   do not cast I aside in my old age ;   as my strength fail , do not forsake I .   for my enemy speak against I ;   they watch and plot against I .    they say , God have abandon he .   Pursue , and seize he !   no one will come to the rescue !   God , be not far from I ;   my God , hasten to help I .    bring to a shameful end   those who attack I ; cover with contempt and scorn   those who seek my ruin .    I will always hope in you   and add to all your praise .   my mouth shall proclaim your just deed ,   day after day your act of deliverance ,   though I can not number they all .    I will speak of the mighty work of the Lord ;   o   God , I will tell of your singular justice .    III   God , you have teach I from my youth ;   to this day I proclaim your wondrous deed .   now that I be old and gray ,    do not forsake I , God , that I may proclaim your might   to all generation yet to come ,   your power      and justice , God ,   to the high heaven . you have do great thing ;    o God , who be your equal ?    whatever bitter affliction you send I ,   you would turn and revive I . from the watery depth of the earth   once more raise I up .   restore my honor ;   turn and comfort I ,   that I may praise you with the lyre   for your faithfulness , my God , and sing to you with the harp ,   O Holy One of Israel !   my lip will shout for joy as I sing your praise ;   my soul , too , which you have redeem .   yes , my tongue shall recount   your justice day by day . for those who seek my ruin   have be shame and disgrace .
