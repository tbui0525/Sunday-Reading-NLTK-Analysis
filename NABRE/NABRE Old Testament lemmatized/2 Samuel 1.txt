Saul and Jonathan , beloved and dear ,   separate neither in life nor death ,   swift than eagle , strong than lion !   woman of Israel , weep over Saul ,   who clothe you in scarlet and in finery ,   cover your clothing with ornament of gold .   how can the warrior have fall   in the thick of battle !   Jonathan\xe2\x80\x94slain upon your height !   I grieve for you , Jonathan my brother !   most dear have you be to I ; more wondrous your love to I   than the love of woman .    how can the warrior have fall ,   the weapon of war have perish !
