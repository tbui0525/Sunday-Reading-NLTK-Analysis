Judas hear of it and himself set out with his soldier to attack the king army at Emmaus      while these force be still scatter away from the camp .      during the night Gorgias come into the camp of Judas , and find no one there ; so he seek they in the mountain , say , they be flee from we .     but at daybreak Judas appear in the plain with three thousand man ; furthermore they lack the helmet and sword they want .      they see the army of the Gentiles ,    strong , breastplate , and flank with cavalry , and make up of experienced soldier .       Judas say to the man with he : do not fear their number or dread their attack .      remember how our ancestor be save in the Red Sea , when Pharaoh pursue they with an army .        so now let we cry to Heaven in the hope that he will favor we , remember the covenant with our ancestor , and destroy this army before we today .      all the Gentiles shall know that there be one who redeem and deliver Israel .     when the foreigner look up and see they march toward they ,      they come out of their camp for battle . the man with Judas blow the trumpet , and      join the battle . they crush the Gentiles , who flee toward the plain .      their whole rear guard fall by the sword , and they be pursue as far as Gazara    and the plain of Idumaea , to Azotus and Jamnia . about three thousand of their man fall .     when Judas and the army return from the pursuit ,      he say to the people : do not be greedy for plunder ; for there be a fight ahead of we ,      and Gorgias and his army be near we on the mountain . but now stand firm against our enemy and fight they . afterward you can freely take the plunder .     as Judas be finish this speech , a detachment    appear , look down from the mountain .      they see that their army have be put to flight and their camp be burn . the smoke they see reveal what have happen .      when they realize this , they completely lose heart ; and when they also see the army of Judas in the plain ready to attack ,      they all flee to the land of the foreigner .      then Judas go back to plunder the camp , and they take much gold and silver , cloth dye blue and marine purple , and great treasure .      as they return , they be singe hymn and glorify Heaven , who be good , whose mercy endure forever .        thus Israel experience a great deliverance that day .    victory over Lysias .      but those of the foreigner who have escape go and tell Lysias all that have occur .      when he hear it he be disturb and discourage , because thing have not turn out in Israel as he intend and as the king have order .     so the following year he gather together sixty thousand pick man and five thousand cavalry , to fight they .      they come into Idumea and camp at Beth - zur ,    and Judas meet they with ten thousand man .      see that the army be strong , he pray thus : bless be you , Savior of Israel , who crush the attack of the mighty one by the hand of your servant David and deliver the foreign camp into the hand of Jonathan , the son of Saul , and his armor - bearer .        give this army into the hand of your people Israel ; make they ashamed of their troop and their cavalry .      strike they with cowardice , weaken the boldness of their strength , and let they tremble at their own destruction .      strike they down by the sword of those who love you , that all who know your name may sing your praise .     then they engage in battle , and about five thousand of Lysias army fall in hand - to - hand fighting .       when Lysias see the tide of the battle turning , and the increase boldness of Judas , whose man be ready either to live or to die nobly , he withdraw to Antioch and begin to recruit mercenary so as to return to Judea with great number .

Judas appoint man to attack those in the citadel , while he purify the sanctuary .      he choose blameless priest , devote to the law ;      these purify the sanctuary and carry away the stone of the defilement to an unclean place .      they deliberate what ought to be do with the altar for burn offering that have be desecrate .        they decide it well to tear it down , lest it be a lasting shame to they that the Gentiles have defile it ; so they tear down the altar .      they store the stone in a suitable place on the temple mount , until the coming of a prophet who could determine what to do with they .        then they take uncut stone , accord to the law , and build a new altar like the former one .        they also repair the sanctuary and the interior of the temple and consecrate the court .      they make new sacred vessel and bring the lampstand , the altar of incense , and the table into the temple .        then they burn incense on the altar and light the lamp on the lampstand , and these illuminate the temple .      they also put loaf on the table and hang up the curtain . thus they finish all the work they have undertake .     they rise early on the morning of the twenty - fifth day of the ninth month , that is , the month of Kislev , in the year one hundred and forty - eight ,        and offer sacrifice accord to the law on the new altar for burn offering that they have make .        on the anniversary of the day on which the Gentiles have desecrate it , on that very day it be rededicate with song , harp , lyre , and cymbal .      all the people prostrate themselves and adore and praise Heaven , who have give they success .     for eight day they celebrate the dedication of the altar and joyfully offer burn offering and sacrifice of deliverance and praise .      they ornament the facade of the temple with gold crown and shield ; they repair the gate and the priest chamber and furnish they with door .      there be great joy among the people now that the disgrace bring by the Gentiles be remove .      then Judas and his brother and the entire assembly of Israel decree that every year for eight day , from the twenty - fifth day of the month Kislev ,    the day of the dedication    of the altar should be observe with joy and gladness on the anniversary .     at that time they build high wall and strong tower around Mount Zion , to prevent the Gentiles from come and trample it as they have do before .      Judas also place a garrison there to protect it , and likewise fortify Beth - zur , that the people might have a stronghold face Idumea .             '
