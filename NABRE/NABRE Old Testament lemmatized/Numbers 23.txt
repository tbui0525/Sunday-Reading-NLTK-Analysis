b '    then Balaam say to Balak , build I seven altar here , and here prepare seven bull and seven ram for I .      so Balak do as Balaam have order , and Balak and Balaam offer a bull and a ram on each altar .      Balaam say to Balak , stand here by your burn offering while I go over there . perhaps the   Lord   will meet I , and then I will tell you whatever he let I see . and so he go out on the barren height .      then God meet Balaam , and Balak say to he : I have erect the seven altar , and have offer a bull and a ram on each altar .      the   Lord   put an utterance in Balaams mouth , and say : go back to Balak , and speak accordingly .      so he go back to Balak , who be still stand by his burn offering together with all the prince of Moab .      then Balaam recite his poem : from Aram    Balak have lead I here ,   Moabs king , from the mountain of qedem :   come , curse for I Jacob ,   come , denounce Israel .   how can I lay a curse on the one whom God have not curse ?   how denounce the one whom the   Lord   have not denounce ?   for from the top of the crag I see he ,   from the height I behold he . here be a people that live apart    and do not reckon itself among the nation .   who have ever count the dust of Jacob ,   who number Israels dust - cloud ?   may I die the death of the just ,   may my end be like theirs !     what have you do to I ? cry Balak to Balaam . it be to lay a curse on my foe that I bring you here ; but instead , you have bless they !      Balaam reply , be it not what the   Lord   put in my mouth that I take care to repeat ?    the Second Oracle .     then Balak say to he , please come with I to another place    from which you can see they ; but you will see only some , not all of they , and from there lie a curse on they for I .      so he bring he to a lookout post on the top of Pisgah , where he build seven altar and offer a bull and a ram on each of they .      Balaam then say to Balak , stand here by your burn offering , while I seek a meeting over there .      then the   Lord   meet Balaam , and , having put an utterance in his mouth , say to he : return to Balak , and speak accordingly .      so he go to Balak , who be still stand by his burn offering together with the prince of Moab . when Balak ask he , what do the   Lord   say ?      Balaam recite his poem : rise , Balak , and listen ;   give ear to my testimony , son of Zippor !   God be not a human being who speak falsely ,   nor a mortal , who feel regret . be God one to speak and not act ,   to decree and not bring it to pass ?   I be summon to bless ;   I will bless ; I can not revoke it !   Misfortune I do not see in Jacob ,   nor do I see misery    in Israel . the   Lord , their God , be with they ;   among they be the war - cry of their king .   they have the like of a wild ox horn :    God who bring they out of Egypt .    no , there be no augury against Jacob ,   nor divination against Israel . now it be say of Jacob ,   of Israel , look what God have do !   here be a people that rise up like a lioness ,   and get up like a lion ; it do not rest till it have devour its prey   and have drink the blood of the slay .      neither lie a curse on they nor bless they , say Balak to Balaam .      but Balaam answer Balak , do I not tell you , everything the   Lord   tell I I must do ?    the Third Oracle .     then Balak say to Balaam , come , let I bring you to another place ; perhaps God will approve of your lay a curse on they for I from there .      so he take Balaam to the top of Peor , that overlook Jeshimon .      Balaam then say to Balak , build I seven altar here ; and here prepare for I seven bull and seven ram .      and Balak do as Balaam have order , offer a bull and a ram on each altar .             '
