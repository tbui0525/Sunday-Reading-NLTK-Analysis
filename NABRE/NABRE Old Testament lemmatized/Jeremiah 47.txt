People will howl and wail ,   every inhabitant of the land .   at the noise of the pound hoof of his steed ,   the clanking chariot , the rumble wheel , parent do not turn back for their child ;   their hand hang helpless ,   because of the day that be come   to destroy all the Philistines and cut off from Tyre and Sidon    the last of their ally . yes , the   Lord   be destroy the Philistines ,   the remnant from the coast of Caphtor .    Baldness be visit upon Gaza ,    Ashkelon be reduce to silence ; Ashdod , remnant of their strength ,   how long will you gash yourself ?    ah ! sword of the   Lord !   when will you find rest ? return to your scabbard ;   stop , be still !   how can it find rest   when the   Lord   have command it ? against Ashkelon and the seacoast ,   there he have appoint it .
