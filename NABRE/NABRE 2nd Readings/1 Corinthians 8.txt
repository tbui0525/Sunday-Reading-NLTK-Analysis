b' Chapter 8 Knowledge Insufficient.    Now in regard to meat sacrificed to idols:   we realize that all of us have knowledge; knowledge inflates with pride, but love builds up.       If anyone supposes he knows something, he does not yet know as he ought to know.     But if one loves God, one is known by him.     So about the eating of meat sacrificed to idols: we know that there is no idol in the world, and that there is no God but one.

Therefore, if food causes my brother to sin, I will never eat meat again, so that I may not cause my brother to sin.            '
