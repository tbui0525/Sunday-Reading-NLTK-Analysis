b'  Power of the Tongue.     Not many of you should become teachers, my brothers, for you realize that we will be judged more strictly,     for we all fall short in many respects. If anyone does not fall short in speech, he is a perfect man, able to bridle his whole body also.       If we put bits into the mouths of horses to make them obey us, we also guide their whole bodies.     It is the same with ships: even though they are so large and driven by fierce winds, they are steered by a very small rudder wherever the pilots inclination wishes.     In the same way the tongue is a small member and yet has great pretensions. Consider how small a fire can set a huge forest ablaze.     The tongue is also a fire. It exists among our members as a world of malice, defiling the whole body and setting the entire course of our lives on fire, itself set on fire by Gehenna.     For every kind of beast and bird, of reptile and sea creature, can be tamed and has been tamed by the human species,     but no human being can tame the tongue. It is a restless evil, full of deadly poison.       With it we bless the Lord and Father, and with it we curse human beings who are made in the likeness of God.     From the same mouth come blessing and cursing. This need not be so, my brothers.     Does a spring gush forth from the same opening both pure and brackish water?     Can a fig tree, my brothers, produce olives, or a grapevine figs? Neither can salt water yield fresh.  True Wisdom.       Who among you is wise and understanding? Let him show his works by a good life in the humility that comes from wisdom.       But if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your hearts, do not boast and be false to the truth.     Wisdom of this kind does not come down from above but is earthly, unspiritual, demonic.     For where jealousy and selfish ambition exist, there is disorder and every foul practice.     But the wisdom from above is first of all pure, then peaceable, gentle, compliant, full of mercy and good fruits, without inconstancy or insincerity.       And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace for those who cultivate peace.             '
