b'  Causes of Division.     Where do the wars and where do the conflicts among you come from? Is it not from your passions   that make war within your members?       You covet but do not possess. You kill and envy but you cannot obtain; you fight and wage war. You do not possess because you do not ask.     You ask but do not receive, because you ask wrongly, to spend it on your passions.     Adulterers!   Do you not know that to be a lover of the world means enmity with God? Therefore, whoever wants to be a lover of the world makes himself an enemy of God.

You are a puff of smoke that appears briefly and then disappears.       Instead you should say, If the Lord wills it,   we shall live to do this or that.     But now you are boasting in your arrogance. All such boasting is evil.      So for one who knows the right thing to do and does not do it, it is a sin.             '
