b'  Christian Spouses.     Likewise, you wives should be subordinate to your husbands so that, even if some disobey the word, they may be won over without a word by their wives conduct     when they observe your reverent and chaste behavior.       Your adornment should not be an external one: braiding the hair, wearing gold jewelry, or dressing in fine clothes,       but rather the hidden character of the heart, expressed in the imperishable beauty of a gentle and calm disposition, which is precious in the sight of God.     For this is also how the holy women who hoped in God once used to adorn themselves and were subordinate to their husbands;     thus Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord. You are her children when you do what is good and fear no intimidation.     Likewise, you husbands should live with your wives in understanding, showing honor to the weaker female sex, since we are joint heirs of the gift of life, so that your prayers may not be hindered.  Christian Conduct.       Finally, all of you, be of one mind, sympathetic, loving toward one another, compassionate, humble.     Do not return evil for evil, or insult for insult; but, on the contrary, a blessing, because to this you were called, that you might inherit a blessing.       For: Whoever would love life   and see good days must keep the tongue from evil  and the lips from speaking deceit,  must turn from evil and do good,  seek peace and follow after it.  For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous  and his ears turned to their prayer, but the face of the Lord is against evildoers. Christian Suffering.       Now who is going to harm you if you are enthusiastic for what is good?     But even if you should suffer because of righteousness, blessed are you. Do not be afraid or terrified with fear of them,     but sanctify Christ as Lord in your hearts. Always be ready to give an explanation to anyone who asks you for a reason for your hope,       but do it with gentleness and reverence, keeping your conscience clear, so that, when you are maligned, those who defame your good conduct in Christ may themselves be put to shame.     For it is better to suffer for doing good, if that be the will of God, than for doing evil.    For Christ also suffered   for sins once, the righteous for the sake of the unrighteous, that he might lead you to God. Put to death in the flesh, he was brought to life in the spirit.       In it he also went to preach to the spirits in prison,       who had once been disobedient while God patiently waited in the days of Noah during the building of the ark, in which a few persons, eight in all, were saved through water.       This prefigured baptism, which saves you now. It is not a removal of dirt from the body but an appeal to God   for a clear conscience, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ,       who has gone into heaven and is at the right hand of God, with angels, authorities, and powers subject to him.
