b'  Qualifications of Various Ministers.     This saying is trustworthy:   whoever aspires to the office of bishop desires a noble task.       Therefore, a bishop must be irreproachable, married only once, temperate, self-controlled, decent, hospitable, able to teach,     not a drunkard, not aggressive, but gentle, not contentious, not a lover of money.       He must manage his own household well, keeping his children under control with perfect dignity;     for if a man does not know how to manage his own household, how can he take care of the church of God?     He should not be a recent convert, so that he may not become conceited and thus incur the devils punishment.       He must also have a good reputation among outsiders, so that he may not fall into disgrace, the devils trap.      Similarly, deacons must be dignified, not deceitful, not addicted to drink, not greedy for sordid gain,     holding fast to the mystery of the faith with a clear conscience.     Moreover, they should be tested first; then, if there is nothing against them, let them serve as deacons.     Women,   similarly, should be dignified, not slanderers, but temperate and faithful in everything.       Deacons may be married only once and must manage their children and their households well.     Thus those who serve well as deacons gain good standing and much confidence in their faith in Christ Jesus. The Mystery of Our Religion.

Undeniably great is the mystery of devotion, Who   was manifested in the flesh, vindicated in the spirit, seen by angels, proclaimed to the Gentiles, believed in throughout the world, taken up in glory.
