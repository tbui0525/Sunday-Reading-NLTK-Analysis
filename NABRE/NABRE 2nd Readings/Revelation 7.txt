b' The 144,000 Sealed.    After this I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth,   holding back the four winds of the earth so that no wind could blow on land or sea or against any tree.       Then I saw another angel come up from the East,   holding the seal of the living God. He cried out in a loud voice to the four angels who were given power to damage the land and the sea,     Do not damage the land or the sea or the trees until we put the seal on the foreheads of the servants of our God.       I heard the number of those who had been marked with the seal, one hundred and forty-four thousand marked   from every tribe of the Israelites:       twelve thousand were marked from the tribe of Judah,   twelve thousand from the tribe of Reuben, twelve thousand from the tribe of Gad,     twelve thousand from the tribe of Asher, twelve thousand from the tribe of Naphtali, twelve thousand from the tribe of Manasseh,     twelve thousand from the tribe of Simeon, twelve thousand from the tribe of Levi, twelve thousand from the tribe of Issachar,     twelve thousand from the tribe of Zebulun, twelve thousand from the tribe of Joseph, and twelve thousand were marked from the tribe of Benjamin.

He said to me, These are the ones who have survived the time of great distress;   they have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.     For this reason they stand before Gods throne  and worship him day and night in his temple.  The one who sits on the throne will shelter them.  They will not hunger or thirst anymore,  nor will the sun or any heat strike them.   For the Lamb who is in the center of the throne will shepherd them  and lead them to springs of life-giving water,   and God will wipe away every tear from their eyes.             '
