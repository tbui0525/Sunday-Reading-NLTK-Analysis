b'  The Baptism of the Gentiles Explained.     Now the apostles and the brothers who were in Judea heard that the Gentiles too had accepted the word of God.     So when Peter went up to Jerusalem the circumcised believers confronted him,     saying, You entered   the house of uncircumcised people and ate with them.     Peter began and explained it to them step by step, saying,      I was at prayer in the city of Joppa when in a trance I had a vision, something resembling a large sheet coming down, lowered from the sky by its four corners, and it came to me.     Looking intently into it, I observed and saw the four-legged animals of the earth, the wild beasts, the reptiles, and the birds of the sky.     I also heard a voice say to me, Get up, Peter. Slaughter and eat.     But I said, Certainly not, sir, because nothing profane or unclean has ever entered my mouth.     But a second time a voice from heaven answered, What God has made clean, you are not to call profane.     This happened three times, and then everything was drawn up again into the sky.     Just then three men appeared at the house where we were, who had been sent to me from Caesarea.     The Spirit told me to accompany them without discriminating. These six brothers   also went with me, and we entered the mans house.     He related to us how he had seen [the] angel standing in his house, saying, Send someone to Joppa and summon Simon, who is called Peter,       who will speak words to you by which you and all your household will be saved.     As I began to speak, the holy Spirit fell upon them as it had upon us at the beginning,       and I remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said, John baptized with water but you will be baptized with the holy Spirit.       If then God gave them the same gift he gave to us when we came to believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I to be able to hinder God?       When they heard this, they stopped objecting and glorified God, saying, God has then granted life-giving repentance to the Gentiles too. The Church at Antioch.       Now those who had been scattered by the persecution that arose because of Stephen went as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch, preaching the word to no one but Jews.       There were some Cypriots and Cyrenians among them, however, who came to Antioch and began to speak to the Greeks as well, proclaiming the Lord Jesus.     The hand of the Lord was with them and a great number who believed turned to the Lord.     The news about them reached the ears of the church in Jerusalem, and they sent Barnabas [to go] to Antioch.     When he arrived and saw the grace of God, he rejoiced and encouraged them all to remain faithful to the Lord in firmness of heart,     for he was a good man, filled with the holy Spirit and faith. And a large number of people was added to the Lord.     Then he went to Tarsus to look for Saul,     and when he had found him he brought him to Antioch. For a whole year they met with the church and taught a large number of people, and it was in Antioch that the disciples were first called Christians.  The Prediction of Agabus.       At that time some prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch,     and one of them named Agabus stood up and predicted by the Spirit that there would be a severe famine all over the world, and it happened under Claudius.       So the disciples determined that, according to ability,   each should send relief to the brothers who lived in Judea.      This they did, sending it to the presbyters in care of Barnabas and Saul.            '
