b'      In the first book,   Theophilus, I dealt with all that Jesus did and taught     until the day he was taken up, after giving instructions through the holy Spirit to the apostles whom he had chosen.       He presented himself alive to them by many proofs after he had suffered, appearing to them during forty days   and speaking about the kingdom of God.       While meeting with them, he enjoined them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for the promise of the Father   about which you have heard me speak;       for John baptized with water, but in a few days you will be baptized with the holy Spirit.        When they had gathered together they asked him, Lord, are you at this time going   to restore the kingdom to Israel?      He answered them,   It is not for you to know the times or seasons that the Father has established by his own authority.      But you will receive power when the holy Spirit comes upon you,   and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, throughout Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.     When he had said this, as they were looking on, he was lifted up, and a cloud took him from their sight.       While they were looking intently at the sky as he was going, suddenly two men dressed in white garments stood beside them.       They said, Men of Galilee, why are you standing there looking at the sky? This Jesus who has been taken up from you into heaven will return in the same way as you have seen him going into heaven.        Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, a sabbath days journey away.       When they entered the city they went to the upper room where they were staying, Peter and John and James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James son of Alphaeus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas son of James.     All these devoted themselves with one accord to prayer, together with some women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and his brothers.    The Choice of Judass Successor.    During those days Peter stood up in the midst of the brothers (there was a group of about one hundred and twenty persons in the one place). He said,     My brothers, the scripture had to be fulfilled which the holy Spirit spoke beforehand through the mouth of David, concerning Judas, who was the guide for those who arrested Jesus.       He was numbered among us and was allotted a share in this ministry.      He bought a parcel of land with the wages of his iniquity, and falling headlong, he burst open in the middle, and all his insides spilled out.       This became known to everyone who lived in Jerusalem, so that the parcel of land was called in their language Akeldama, that is, Field of Blood.     For it is written in the Book of Psalms: Let his encampment become desolate,  and may no one dwell in it. And: May another take his office.     Therefore, it is necessary that one of the men who accompanied us the whole time the Lord Jesus came and went among us,     beginning from the baptism of John until the day on which he was taken up from us, become with us a witness to his resurrection.       So they proposed two, Joseph called Barsabbas, who was also known as Justus, and Matthias.     Then they prayed, You, Lord, who know the hearts of all, show which one of these two you have chosen     to take the place in this apostolic ministry from which Judas turned away to go to his own place.       Then they gave lots to them, and the lot fell upon Matthias, and he was counted with the eleven apostles.            '
